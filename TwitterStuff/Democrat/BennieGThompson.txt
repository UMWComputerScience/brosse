Today, I’m urging Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.Voting is not a use-it-or-lose-it-right. But 5 years after Shelby County v. Holder, anti-voter politicians are using tactics like voter purges to take eligible voters off the voter rolls. We must #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/B39HMi8L4b"There have been proposed tariffs — taxes that companies pay to ship or bring in merchandise — that will effect manufacturing companies in our state that produce steel and aluminum." https://t.co/ngyTdJJiqPFifty-five years ago, Civil Right icon, Medgar Evers, was assassinated in front of his Jackson home.

That’s why I’m listening to the many men and women of faith who’ve expressed their significant concern with #SNAP cuts in partisan #GOPFarmBill. #ProtectSNAP #NoHouseFarmBillHouse Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn’t kick a single person off #SNAP.
