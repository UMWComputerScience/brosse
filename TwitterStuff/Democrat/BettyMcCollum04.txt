Thank you to the hardworking staff at @MemorialBldCtrs in St. Paul for our meeting and tour this morning. It was great to discuss the importance and need for blood donation and see your state-of-the-art laboratory testing facilities. https://t.co/J17QexzKg8Congratulations to Spc. Tarrant Collet of the 434th Chemical Company on being named Soldier of the Year at the Minnesota National Guard Best Warrior 2018 competition! Your service and dedication to our nation make the Fourth District very proud. https://t.co/OKw2jEnuz4The retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy gives President Trump the opportunity to reshape the Supreme Court for a generation and move his extreme agenda forward. All Americans should be very concerned.Every Democrat was joined by 112 Republicans in opposing @HouseGOP’s latest extreme immigration bill. Democrats have bipartisan legislation to protect Dreamers and fix our broken immigration system, @HouseGOP should join us in bringing these bills to the floor.I will vote NO on @HouseGOP’s latest extreme anti-immigrant bill (H.R. 6136). Yet again, Republicans refuse to work with Democrats to protect Dreamers &amp; TPS recipients, while they continue their push to waste taxpayer money on a wall Americans don’t want.The #Janus decision overturns decades of precedent, 22 state laws, &amp; will make it harder for unions to fight for better pay for workers. This is another example of how this conservative court continues to rig our economy against working people in favor of big corps &amp; the top 1%.ICYMI: The #GOPTaxScam imposes a new tax on religious communities, colleges, hospitals &amp; other nonprofits covering employee costs like parking &amp; meals. This new tax is another way Minnesotans are being forced to pay for this deficit-exploding giveaway to big corps &amp; billionaires.Thank you to the talented students of @highlandsr_spps FIRST Robotics Team for visiting my office today and discussing the importance of expanding STEAM programs and the FIRST Robotics program. https://t.co/ByNII7BZcyThanks @GovMarkDayton for standing up to the Trump admin proposed rule that would revoke legal permanent status for “public charges.” This would affect families using public benefits – endangering our immigrant community &amp; putting public health at risk. https://t.co/Mmqj3pAkbC@Upworthy @HRC A6: In 1993 as a member of the Minnesota State House, I was proud to vote to ban workplace discrimination in our state. Now, we need to move to pass these protections at the federal level so that all LGBTQ people can be protected from harassment in the workplace.Access to a free and open internet is not a privilege – it’s a right. The Senate has voted to uphold #NetNeutrality, but @HouseGOP refuses to act. I am fighting to #SaveTheInternet and have signed a discharge petition that would force a vote in the House.Dred Scott, Korematsu, and now, Trump v. Hawaii. For the Supreme Court to uphold this patently discriminatory religious ban is an appalling betrayal of American values. Today’s decision joins a line of rulings history will look back on in shame. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/g68wIO2bkCOur democracy works best when all eligible voters can be heard in fair and open elections. 5 years ago, the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder and enabled more than 24 states to enact anti-voter laws. We must #RestoreTheVOTE and pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act.Thank you to @TPT and the @VVMF for bringing “The Wall That Heals” to the @mncapitol. This weekend, Minnesota Remembers Vietnam gives us an opportunity to remember, honor, understand, and heal. https://t.co/YNyUo78hcWI commend the bravery and life-saving action by the Union Pacific and Upper River Services workers.

https://t.co/AiuKPQGg09Today is the 46th anniversary of Congress passing Title IX, legislation that provided equal opportunity in education for women. Since its passing, women and girls have made incredible strides in education, but there are still barriers to equity that Congress must address.This weekend I am excited to join thousands of Minnesotans in celebrating #Pride2018. This is a time to celebrate the progress made in the fight for equality, to honor the contributions made by LGBTQ Americans to our nation, and to redouble our efforts to end discrimination. https://t.co/AjXtxswzrvIt’s pollinator week!

Thanks to orgs like @BeeKind_MN for helping #SaveTheBees!Tomorrow, @SpringboardArts  is hosting an open house and community celebration to unveil their new space in St. Paul! Make sure to drop by to see the new space and welcome a new creative hub to our community. https://t.co/5CKbbfiOYz.@HouseGOP passed the Farm Bill. Instead of working on a bipartisan solution to solve the crisis at the border, Republicans spent the day pushing a bill that cuts more than $20B from SNAP - which feeds hungry children, weakens environmental protections, &amp; harms public health.It was great to meet with @heycriticalmass and discuss the importance of student loan deferment for young adults going through cancer treatment. https://t.co/kVPDmsoAdgThe first draconian Republican immigration bill (H.R. 4760) just failed on the House floor. I voted against this hyperpartisan bill, but 193 Republicans supported it.I will vote NO on the two @HouseGOP immigration bills. No attempt from @HouseGOP to work with Democrats was made. They leave our Dreamers behind, do not solve the separation crisis, waste taxpayer money on a wall Americans don’t want, and dismantle our legal immigration system.Last night in MN, @realDonaldTrump announced plans to allow toxic sulfide-ore mining on the doorstep of the BWCA. This sabotages the scientific withdrawal study underway to protect the BWCA, and is a direct attack on this pristine wilderness.Big congrats to the East metro students who took top honors at this year’s National History Day competition. You make the Fourth District so proud! https://t.co/I5QFKrZz5gThis week, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial will be on display at the MN State Capitol grounds. “The Wall that Heals” is a beautiful monument made to honor and reflect upon the sacrifices our brave Vietnam veterans made for our nation. https://t.co/ec3tq2ct69Today I joined @NancyPelosi &amp; several of my colleagues in speaking out against the GOP budget &amp; the devastating impact it would have on MN. The proposed cuts to Medicaid alone would impact 1.1 mil Minnesotans, &amp; is one of the reasons I support #ABetterDeal https://t.co/aqgpTkGMZeNYT: "Trump Retreating After Border Policy Outcry."

Our work to pass HR 4391 &amp; end US funding for Israel’s abusive military detention of Palestinian children is about peace and respecting the human rights of all Palestinians.  #NoWayToTreatAChild @reverendmae https://t.co/cpU4mGgV2v.@SenJeffMerkley is right: “zero-tolerance policy means zero humanity.” The Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents is a moral outrage and shames our nation.  #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/vrX2nBFHqIPsychologists call Trump's family separation actions “intentional infliction of trauma as a deterrent to attempting to enter the US. This is a form of emotional violence.” I agree: “There is no justification for intentional cruelty against children under any circumstances.” https://t.co/g4bEq7W4vGNeed help with a federal agency?

Good luck to the players on both sides, and go Dems!@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP The GOP’s sabotage efforts have come in the form of: the #GOPTaxScam that kicked 13 mil. off of their health insurance, the disruption of https://t.co/yPq2zOAyUi and open enrollment, the intro of short-term “junk” plans, &amp; the continued assault on Medicare and Medicaid.MN individual &amp; group insurance rates are set to be released tomorrow. We will see the effects of @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP sabotage of our healthcare system in the form of higher premiums for Minnesotans.For-profit universities lied to students about their worthless degrees for decades, helped by Acics, an unfit and irresponsible accrediting body.  @BetsyDeVosED just reinstated Acics, even as her own staff reported they failed 57 of 93 federal standards.   https://t.co/TIcxZxY3B7Today marks the 243rd birthday of the United States Army. Throughout its history, the United States Army has defended our nation and our allies around the globe. Thanks to the women and men who proudly serve. #ArmyBDay #USArmyI am offering an amendment to prevent raises for high-level political appointees of the Trump admin. Too many American families are seeing stagnant wages; the last thing we should do is reward the admin’s corrupt political appointees like @EPAScottPruitt with more taxpayer money.Unaffordable #SummerCare shouldn’t jeopardize how working parents and their children spend their summer break. I am proud to cosponsor the Child Care for Working Families Act, which creates affordable and flexible childcare options for families.I support @RepBarbaraLee’s amend to sunset the 2001 AUMF. 17 years later, Congress hasn't had a debate on how 3 admins have used the AUMF to expand military action around the world. @HouseGOP should let Congress debate this – we owe the American people &amp; our troops nothing less.Pres. Trump’s summit with Kim Jong-Un has left us with more questions than answers. There are no verifiable steps for how NK will denuclearize &amp; in the meantime the President has thrown our alliances with South Korea &amp; Japan into chaos.

There is still progress to be made, which is why I am proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Equality Act.Thank you for inviting me to speak @Teamsters Save Our Pensions rally today.

I am encouraged to see @NatlParkService restoring this important wolf population for the health of the island. https://t.co/3TFiaEsH84Further proof that @EPAScottPruitt is abusing his position as a public servant by treating federal employees as his personal servants.  This has gone from bad to worse to absurd, and still @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP refuse to #BootPruitt.  https://t.co/33DScPWXLXThe Trump administration announced that it has eliminated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s consumer advisory board. Not only does this make the CFPB’s job to hold industry accountable more difficult, it puts big business ahead of consumers. https://t.co/Pvat1JIzxnWhile @realDonaldTrump has been busy imposing tariffs on our friends and allies, Minnesota farmers have been suffering. Pork prices are projected to rise 20%, which will leave small farms at large risk of having to go out of business. https://t.co/wxUpSdAEehSecretary Zinke’s decision to deploy U.S. Park Police to the U.S.-Mexico border is a political farce. Congress must know the impact this deployment will have on Interior’s ability to safeguard our national parks and wildlife refuges.I am a strong supporter of @NitaLowey’s amendment to prevent oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We must do everything we can to protect this wild and pristine land..@EPAScottPruitt’s egregious misuse of taxpayer dollars is unacceptable. I support the amendment from @RepMarkPocan to fully fund the EPA Inspector General so that they may continue the numerous ethics investigations against #PollutingPruittI am deeply disappointed that @HouseGOP is proposing dramatic cuts that endanger our nation’s natural resources and our precious wildlife. I am offering an amendment to strike all harmful riders that protect polluters and threaten our environment.Secretary Zinke stated he wants to reorganize the Interior Department for the next 100 years. I am offering an amendment to withhold funding for this reorganization until Congress has all the facts.I am shocked that Administrator Pruitt has not been removed from President Trump’s cabinet when other Cabinet members were removed for far less egregious abuses. #PollutingPruittIn February, Congress appropriated $516 mill to Interior for recovery from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. As of the week of May 14th, $3 million was obligated – which means the Dept. had withheld $513 million. This is unacceptable when hurricane season begins this month.These cuts target air and water quality programs, and reduce funding to enforce the law against polluters. If enacted, they will undermine the EPA’s ability to keep our families and communities healthy, and to protect our environment for future generations.You can read my full opening statement at today's markup here → https://t.co/4DLjv6kqmKI'm leading @AppropsDems now as we mark up the fiscal year 2019 Interior-Environment appropriations bill.

This is an excuse for the Trump admin to focus on anything but gun violence prevention. When will they get serious about protecting kids?https://t.co/FK9cWZ7e0kUnless Congress acts, Medicare will become insolvent by 2026 and Social Security will become depleted by 2034. Instead, President Trump and @HouseGOP want to slash Medicare and Social Security more to pay for their #TaxScamThe latest ethical fail by @EPAScottPruitt: He abused his official position and taxpayer resources to try to get his wife a Chick-fil-A franchise.

Better to prevent an economic crisis than invite one.Another trumped up gimmick by @realDonaldTrump: the fake summit that was never going to happen. NK dictator gains status, credibility, &amp; advantage while Trump's footsie w/ Kim further erodes US moral standing/leadership. Now what?

The Trump-Pence Title X gag rule would restrict women’s reproductive rights and would prevent millions of Americans from getting essential, preventative healthcare. The GOP must stop its attack on women’s health.In major embarrassment to GOP, House fails to pass massive Farm Bill in face of conservative Republican showdown https://t.co/zYF8kXL49XTerrible Republican Farm Bill - HR 2 - was just defeated in the House by Democrats and 30 defecting Republicans.  This bill punished poor, hungry families, protected polluters, and propped up profits for big corporations.  3 days of floor debate just crashed and burned - good!Continued acts of gun violence against our children demand more than thoughts and prayers.  Complacency is unacceptable – our children deserve to be protected and Congress must act. Enough is enough!The #GOPFarmBill weakens environmental and public health protections against dangerous pesticides linked to cancer and other chronic diseases. One of the many reasons I will vote NO.Last night I had the privilege of speaking at the Library of Congress before a screening of @PBS’s remarkable documentary, “Going To War.” Make sure to catch it on PBS on Memorial Day. #GoingToWarPBS https://t.co/PLyXzaWRu0 https://t.co/yImpmreyOYI commend MN Commissioners @JLincStine &amp; @MDHCommMalcolm for standing up to @EPAScottPruitt and fighting to protect accurate scientific research.

In Congress, I’m proud to fight for clean air, clean water, public lands &amp; a healthy planet! https://t.co/n4kdTJhNkbNo, @realDonaldTrump. The “disgrace” is the corruption &amp; misconduct that you’ve let run amok in your administration. https://t.co/B6xcT2Q49rToday’s @USCBO report shows the true cost of the @HouseGOP’s huge tax breaks for big corporations &amp; billionaires: Exploding annual deficits that will saddle future generations with trillions in debt. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/t73kKJhmDqNeed help with a federal agency?

Read my letter to them in @lillienews → https://t.co/pcUayB3EZSThank you to the grassroots activists on the National Mall today protesting @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SecretaryZinke's plans to sell off some of America's most treasured places for drilling &amp; mining. These special places are #TooWildToDrill! https://t.co/uyAfQDRJB3It was wonderful to join a big crowd today to kick off the 50th anniversary celebration for the Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway! #MakeYourSplash https://t.co/66F3i8MJB8It’s sadly unsurprising that @SecretaryZinke, who has repeatedly said he doesn’t care about diversity, has “disproportionately reassigned” his Department’s Native American senior staff. This apparent discrimination is just plain wrong. https://t.co/jbTbdKLm0xAfter exploding annual deficits with the #GOPTaxScam, it's galling that @HouseGOP is now preaching about fiscal responsibility. Their latest political gimmick will force cuts to Medicare, Medicaid &amp; other vital programs Minnesotans rely on. https://t.co/L8KQL42OCn.@EPAScottPruitt's sweetheart deal from a lobbyist on a Capitol Hill apartment is just plain corrupt. Americans deserve honesty &amp; integrity from their government, not shady real estate deals &amp; lavish first class travel at taxpayer expense. https://t.co/q0hbMQxuWYAs we recall the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we can honor his memory by continuing his work to eliminate all forms of discrimination, expand voting rights, end poverty, and establish a more peaceful &amp; just foreign policy. #MLK50 https://t.co/UHSlpC56Kd https://t.co/vICfzoYL7cSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller’s #TrumpRussia investigation has already found serious wrongdoing, with a defendant now sentenced to jail time. Congress must protect this fair &amp; independent investigation from @realDonaldTrump’s interference. https://t.co/eG13abXNvzIt was wonderful to visit with Harry Camp, 107, in North Oaks today. Harry is a former civil servant who dedicated his life to the U.S. @forestservice. https://t.co/A50rvPO9jz https://t.co/OQ8oIKrZ66Interested in attending a U.S. Service Academy?

I'm excited to work with Mayor Carter to keep our community safe, strong &amp; moving forward. https://t.co/htmYftrpvII am horrified by the tragic wounding &amp; killing of Palestinian protesters in Gaza last Friday. Attacks on peaceful Palestinian protesters must end, and the U.S. &amp; the international community must do more to support a resolution to the conflict.    
https://t.co/gloUgvPmpDHappy #Easter! Wishing everyone a day filled with happiness and the joy of friends and family. https://t.co/l3fAqpUuetCongrats to @StPaulOpen junior Emily Yang on winning the Minnesota State Archery Championship! https://t.co/x0ezEuZnRhWishing a happy, joyous, and peaceful #Passover to our friends, neighbors &amp; co-workers of the Jewish faith. https://t.co/Y1Leh4L4of.@HouseDemocrats are working to secure our elections, which is why we made sure the omnibus appropriations bill provides @EACgov with $380 million for state election security — including more than $6.5 million for Minnesota! https://t.co/v7nIodBHZMFuel economy standards are critical to improving air quality &amp; preventing climate change. Now @EPAScottPruitt wants to roll back these standards to pad the pockets of corporate special interests. That’s wrong — and hurts Americans families. https://t.co/cYyEvpQefX.@SecretaryCarson's refusal to enforce rules that prevent discrimination in America's public housing system is alarming. Americans must keep fighting for fair housing &amp; against @realDonaldTrump's backwards agenda. https://t.co/82B3vSvJKPDr. Ronny Jackson appears to be a good man, but I am concerned by both his lack of managerial experience &amp; the Trump administration's VA privatization agenda. The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee should carefully examine this nomination. https://t.co/pctMN7oJubI'm getting important updates from our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico about their needs in the ongoing recovery from Hurricane Maria. Six months after the disaster, there is still much more to do. 

I'm going to keep fighting to ensure Puerto Rico has our continued support. https://t.co/McEfLQGRZMA fair &amp; accurate #Census is essential to the well-being of our nation. Congress must stop @realDonaldTrump from adding an unnecessary &amp; untested citizenship question to the #2020Census that is designed to suppress participation &amp; further his own political purposes. https://t.co/J37whVYlNWAs we mark #VietnamVeteransDay, we recognize and thank our Vietnam Veterans &amp; their families for their service — and we remember the more than 58,000 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice. #NationalVietnamVeteransDay https://t.co/lBSSDXnaRh.@HHSGov’s proposed Refusal of Care rule makes it easier for health care providers to deny women &amp; LGBT individuals access to basic medical care. I'm urging the Trump administration to drop this discriminatory rule. #PutPatientsFirst https://t.co/Ydichew4xh https://t.co/LYOgskS2ByThe #GOPTaxScam has exploded annual federal deficits — and @HouseGOP is plotting to use those deficits to justify huge cuts to Medicaid, Medicare &amp; eventually Social Security. The tax scam giveaway to the 1 percent is terrible for MN's working families. https://t.co/kepOaj1xYN@VP @realDonaldTrump Instead of the backwards Trump-Pence agenda and the Cover-Up @HouseGOP, Minnesotans &amp; Americans deserve a Congress that stands up to the President, holds this out-of-control White House accountable &amp; gives the American people #ABetterDeal than they’re getting now.@VP @realDonaldTrump Contrary to @VP Pence’s rhetoric today, eliminating environmental safeguards &amp; implementing bigoted, discriminatory immigration policies makes America weaker, not greater.@VP In his first year in office, @realDonaldTrump has sabotaged Americans’ health care, raised taxes on middle class Minnesotans to pay for tax giveaways to billionaires &amp; presided over the most corrupt White House in history.The sunny vision of the Trump administration that @VP Mike Pence told Minnesotans today is completely at odds with the stormy reality. https://t.co/xTcyqaHm0BAs @VP prepares to speak in Minnesota, a reminder that the #GOPTaxScam hiked taxes on many middle class families while giving a massive windfall to corporate CEOs &amp; Wall Street bankers. https://t.co/p7cJVcZfv5These 26 generals &amp; admirals are right: @realDonaldTrump's #transban is a "troubling move backward." Congress should reverse his ban and #ProtectTransTroops. https://t.co/cBf8nhI1iREnvironmental policy should be based on scientific facts and evidence, not the whims of Big Oil and major polluters. We must keep fighting to defend science from @realDonaldTrump &amp; @EPAScottPruitt's attacks. https://t.co/eWDQtogQAxIncluding a citizenship question on the 2020 Census is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to undermine a fair, accurate &amp; nonpartisan count. Congress should reverse this decision &amp; protect the integrity of the Census. https://t.co/lMGSntTmYkAs Ranking Member of Interior-Environment @AppropsDems, I'm traveling to Puerto Rico this week to conduct oversight of federal recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

Instead of covering up for @realDonaldTrump, @HouseGOP should investigate &amp; find the truth. Learn more → https://t.co/4DPWgrVRSiI'm formally requesting that @GOPoversight open an investigation into @realDonaldTrump's hush agreement with Stormy Daniels. Americans deserve to know if the President violated federal campaign finance law to silence an adult film actress with whom he had an extramarital affair. https://t.co/zqVRzCAyn8Good questions about preventing gun violence in today's @StarTribune. My answers: I strongly support a ban on high-capacity magazines &amp; I've never taken a dime from the @NRA. 

We need action to keep our families &amp; communities safe. #NeverAgain https://t.co/lk0imb6mm5Congratulations to Joanna Ramirez Barrett, Shawntera Hardy, Pheng Thao &amp; Rhiana Yazzie on being named 2018 @BushFoundation Fellows! https://t.co/vu2jYUaRNNMinnesota's own Robert Holmstrom and his fellow veterans of the Office of Strategic Services played a pivotal role in winning World War II.

On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you. https://t.co/KK3qZAyOq3This is a beautiful story about St. Paul native Skyler Kuczaboski's work to create a children's book in Ojibwe. Congratulations on this accomplishment and thank you for your work! https://t.co/EhZ8VOT4k3This is what democracy looks like! 

@SpeakerRyan, listen to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who marched today and let Congress vote on legislation to protect our families &amp; communities! #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/hscIilX3JRIt's wonderful to see such a big turnout for the @MarchForOurLivesMN in St. Paul. 

Minnesotans want action to #PreventGunViolence. Congress must deliver. #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/stlYqkWyTQI’m so proud of the courageous young people marching across our country today demanding action to #PreventGunViolence. As Americans it’s time to say #NeverAgain and act to keep our families &amp; communities safe. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/5N8r6ZjpHC.@realDonaldTrump’s latest attack on the LGBT community — blocking patriotic transgender Americans from serving in our military — is bigoted &amp; wrong. Congress must act to #ProtectTransTroops. https://t.co/hs81XIoIOiCongrats to @Sannehfdn on receiving a $100,000 federal grant through @NationalService to support five @AmeriCorpsVISTA members working with at-risk youth in our community through the Dreamline program! https://t.co/u0K9j00jDWJane Freeman was a dear friend and I was fortunate to have her as a role model in my life.
