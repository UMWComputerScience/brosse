Was honored this week to accept an award from the Association of State and Tribal Home Visiting Initiatives. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV) remains critical and I was proud to work with @ASTHVITweets to protect it. https://t.co/QA9q6p0r9fSo happy to welcome the Panarese family for their first visit to Capitol Hill! Medicaid and children’s health care have been so important in Christian’s life and for millions of other kids. Thank you @ChildrensSpecNJ  and @Warren_E_Moore for all that you do. #SpeakNowforKids https://t.co/7HrmnkxUTuWhile we anxiously await more information from Annapolis on this heinous crime, my thoughts are with the victims, their families, their friends, and their entire community. Just devastating. #EndGunViolenceOn our latest episode of To the Point, our discussion was on the impact of gun violence in schools and the inspiring student movement that continues to grow.
https://t.co/yHrYxidsvY via @YouTubeWednesday was National HIV Testing Day. While we've come a long way in treatment and social acceptance, so much work remains. #GetTested and urge Congress to continue supporting the Ryan White program. #NHTD #DoingItMyWay https://t.co/RPAeAM4r9qMy colleagues on @WaysMeansCmte and I met with @FederalReserve Chair Jerome Powell for a candid discussion. We talked at length on policies Congress should be enacting to foster economic growth, workforce investment, &amp; the creation of good paying jobs. https://t.co/NtdBnaurzmWhile Trump's corruption threatens our constitutional foundations, @HouseGOP stands derelict and even complicit. @RepTedLieu and I will keep trying to pull the curtains open and let the sunlight in. https://t.co/SXmA5cBTTbThe fake "compromise" goes down like the Hindenburg. If just two more members of @HouseGOP sign the discharge petition we can pass a #DreamAct today. How about it @SpeakerRyan? https://t.co/QhnrZbFXRyJanus is the culmination of a decades-long war to destroy unions, delivered by a stolen Supreme Court seat &amp; a pres campaign built on lies. Our greatest period of prosperity was paved by organized laborers. Unions will remain pillars of American life &amp; rebuild the middle class. https://t.co/7PlP4wmzT9After years of crowing that debt was the gravest crisis facing America, @HouseGOP blew it up it to give big corporations and their executives a tax cut. This is the result. https://t.co/VWMz6MWSRPTrump's abuse of the pardon power is a grave threat to America. Yet @HouseGOP just voted to block my and @tedlieu's effort to impose proper oversight. We will continue to exercise every tool we can to stop him. The fight isn't over. https://t.co/OfRwx8KRGZA Supreme Court seat stolen by Republicans is paying dividends in service of Trump's hateful agenda. Today's decision ignores America's promise of religious liberty. It is a tragedy. #NoMuslimBanEver.@HouseGOP promised for years that they’d simplify tax-filing. They lied. Courtesy of the #GopTaxScam, you’ll be subsidizing tax cuts for the top 1% -- and filing more onerous paperwork to boot. https://t.co/FdPUff4lJe https://t.co/3Ggve93IUnTomorrow, the House Judiciary Committee will consider my and @tedlieu's resolution to put sunlight on Donald Trump's dangerous use of pardons. This is a critical opportunity to build awareness of Trump's abuses. https://t.co/jj7vFO4BglHarley-Davidson execs pocketed millions from the #GOPTaxScam, fired 100s of workers, &amp; are now offshoring jobs. This is the fruit of unfair tax "reform" &amp; trade policy that doesn't put US workers first. Note to Trump: Trade wars are not easy to win and produce collateral damage. https://t.co/D8tQsxpySTYes we can! #CongressMustRequest https://t.co/hGYWLMYwfrWe live in a nation built on the rule of law. It is what has sustained us for soon-to-be 242 years. And America will remain a nation of laws long after you leave office. https://t.co/x0t9bdXYeQCongratulations to everyone at the Jewish Family Service &amp; Children’s Center of Clifton-Passaic for your wonderful new facility.

Who says history doesn't repeat itself? #TrumpCorruption https://t.co/Vn5WQN9TTeWe're all thinking about the students, chaperones, parents, first responders, and everyone else at the scene of the accident. I am monitoring any developments. Right now #Englewood deserves our prayers. https://t.co/B1GbP2s00MGreat choices Pete. Everyone in #Paterson and #Clifton know Al Raoucue is one the hidden gems in North Jersey. https://t.co/dtAcHfjWLGThis is so much donkey dust. Today we are voting on two sham immigration bills that are nothing but publicity stunts. For over a decade, @HouseGOP has rejected every single immigration compromise. We know where they stand. https://t.co/y6LZTXPMhmThis week I welcomed Quebec General Delegate Jean-Claude Lauzon. We discussed fair trade, NAFTA, and the importance of the US-Canada alliance. https://t.co/HqGJWEFJkLThis morning I spoke in the House in favor of workers whose pensions are being snatched away while their multinational employer's executives reap millions in bonuses &amp; ship jobs overseas. This is not how the American worker should be treated!
https://t.co/tPEBaOx0J5  via @YouTubeTrump's debasement of the pardon power represents one of the gravest dangers facing our republic. @tedlieu and I have an oped in @USATODAY this morning shining light on Trump's abuses.
https://t.co/o44mFk4jRcNearly two months later, we have not received an answer to our letter from @realDonaldTrump. RT if you want to know why this administration has turned its back on refugees! #WorldRefugeeDay #WithRefugeesBut thanks to Trump, the US has slashed our refugee acceptance rate in half to only 45,000. Credible estimates suggest we will not even meet that goal. That is why I led 126 of my colleagues to demand answers on refugee resettlement. https://t.co/QQ1vrjGGSaWhile their stories are uplifting, nearly 70m people are displaced from their homes because of war, violence, &amp; persecution. The global response has been mixed, but some nations and NGOs, like @theIRC, have stepped up to support the neediest among us #WorldRefugeeDayOn #WorldRefugeeDay, I am reminded of the refugees I have met after being resettled in New Jersey. They all sought a better, safer life for their families. https://t.co/Dy5NYLYco8Thank you Gov. Murphy for your leadership on behalf of charity and humanity. https://t.co/lrI5zKrmbYRather than standing up to Donald Trump's cruel child separation policies, the @HouseGOP caucus gave him a standing ovation instead. https://t.co/fTjFyxmUnGWe mark this day to memorialize those who suffered under the yoke of slavery, to rejoice in their liberation, and to celebrate the promise of America. #Juneteenth remains more important than ever. https://t.co/T6BoUdoSksThis haunting audio is only a sample of the pain and suffering caused by Trump's cruel immigration polices. Mothers and fathers should not be separated from their sons and daughters. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/57ketiS1vDRussians pumped over $100M into Trump real estate in CASH through shell companies. Hey @HouseGOP: any interest in oversight of this scandal? Any interest in the #TrumpTaxReturns? #CongressMustRequest https://t.co/JIlX6JWE84On Friday we marked World Elder Abuse Day. Educating our communities on how to prevent abuse means we are all doing our part to support everyone. #elderjustice https://t.co/2EXLHMLvU8This is a lie. I saw yesterday for myself how the Trump administration's deliberate policies are tearing families in half. Have you ever seen a father cry when he can't find his daughter? After your speech this morning, you should be ashamed of yourself. https://t.co/X7gDMxAVmGMeeting the talented students of Paterson’s School 19 today takes me back to my years as a teacher. Thank you Ms. Vancheri for allowing me to talk with your 2nd grade class about the different levels of government in our country. https://t.co/9RkojNvmhp.@RepJerryNadler is describing the heartbreaking stories we heard. Trump and Sessions says they're following laws. There are no laws requiring families to be ripped apart! Republicans control every lever of government. They are making this disgrace happen. https://t.co/noPFfR85LtWe are here today to tell Trump and Jeff Sessions that America welcomes its tired, its poor, its huddled masses -- it doesn't put them in jails and tent cities. What we saw inside is despicable! It is a sin! https://t.co/XI1E7JhRtQ. @RepJerryNadler @RepJeffries @RepSires @FrankPallone @RepMaloney @RepEspaillat and I are now exiting the facility and about to speak about what we've seen and heard in the jail. https://t.co/uWu7Lf9I02The detention center staff have again covered up the windows to keep press from looking inside the facility. But when my colleagues and I get out we'll tell everything we've seen inside. #FathersDay #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/v5kgARxwkYThe rally outside the Elizabeth detention facility keeps growing. The crowd is now chanting against the breaking up of families by ICE. #FathersDay2018 #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/wAHbDMiodQProtests outside the ICE detention center in Elizabeth continue to swell as I and my House colleagues tour the facility. Americans are fed up with the Trump administration's cruelty. #FathersDay #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/ZeKPm6h44DWith congressional Members just allowed inside to see prisoners and conditions, jail staff now asking all press to leave and go outside.

It's been an hour and a half now. My colleagues and I are getting fed up w/ICE's obstruction. @RepJerryNadler and I continue to negotiate to let us in. #FathersDay #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/QD6oCaxaxTThis is a perfect example of ICE’s disorganization throughout our country. We’ve been very patient this morning. Now they're asking us to empty our pockets like we're common criminals? We are duly elected Members of Congress -- and we want access. #FathersDay https://t.co/DcftcPFwJJJail staff are demanding that all our pocket items be handed off. It appears we will finally be granted access but waiting for confirmation. #FathersDay #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/KhnagxzieJICE staff told us to wait five minutes. That was 50 minutes ago. @RepJerryNadler @FrankPallone @RepSires @RepMaloney @RepEspaillat @RepJeffries and I literally banging on the door to gain entry to the jail to see separated families. https://t.co/IwfZrQzGioICE detention center staff are now examining my @RepJerryNadler and @RepEspaillat's Congressional IDs to verify our identities. They still refuse to grant us access to the facility. #FathersDay #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/efuwQCR8YHIt appears jail staff have summoned the Elizabeth Police. We continue to demand entry. #FathersDay #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/nuqnOyrh7hDetention center employees have covered the window with paper to block our view.

We are still being denied access. https://t.co/oH95sEa0KwRight now I am in the ICE detention center in Elizabeth with @RepJerryNadler, @FrankPallone, @RepSires, @RepMaloney, @RepJeffries, and @RepEspaillat demanding immediate access to see parents who've been separated from their children by the administration. https://t.co/yC3aN5hEGeNow Trump's lawyer is floating obstructing justice with pardons.

After hammering NJ taxpayers with #GOPTaxScam, attacking funding for Gateway Tunnel, and targeting Sandy relief, @HouseGOP is attacking NJ one more time. We must stand united against this legislative blackmail. https://t.co/JE1rlRX2qKDelighted to see the Wetzel family of NJ and #NJ09 as they raise awareness for ALS through the #IcedTeaChallenge.

https://t.co/xIYrEN4LcdTrump and his family continue to profit from his office. Americans could learn the extent of the corruption if @HouseGOP demanded the #TrumpTaxReturns. I won't stop asking. #CongressMustRequest. https://t.co/H7ABpy6CukStock buybacks and cash-outs by Wall Street execs are setting records, thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. Investment and wage growth? Not so much. And remember: this is @HouseGOP’s proudest achievement after 18 months of chaos and corruption. https://t.co/0WlPPobWfCThe barbarity of this is unfathomable. It will do nothing to keep us safe. It is antithetical to everything that makes America great. https://t.co/DZ64Z5pDEhThank you to the bipartisan @NatlGovsAssoc for supporting my Alternatives to Opioids bill, up for consideration tomorrow on the House floor. ALTO legislation will help hospitals across America fight the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/EWkMlHAxavI just had a terrific conversation w/students and local veterans at #CliffsidePark High School.

My resolution w/@tedlieu will put critical sunlight on Trump's damaging practices. https://t.co/Zh8I3wynQuToday, @tedlieu and I introduced legislation to seek answers on Donald Trump's continued abuse of the pardon power. Congress must exercise real oversight to this unprecedented threat to democracy. The office is a presidency, not a monarchy. https://t.co/PpVv1YcF5ADonald Trump lied when he said he would protect Americans with preexisting conditions. This scurrilous move would give insurance companies license to raise premiums at will and imperil coverage for tens of millions. https://t.co/Ar3gkBsi3wI am feeling deep sadness for Anthony Bourdain's passing. Bourdain introduced us to the rich kaleidoscope of world culture and humanity. As a New Jerseyan he lived life with bottomless gusto and never forgot his state. He is irreplaceable. https://t.co/uCSMYjZHoQFor @HouseGOP to pretend to care about fiscal responsibility after they exploded the deficit by $1.8T takes real brass. This bill is another scam that would wreak havoc on a host of critical programs. https://t.co/swne1El2bBWelcome back to the diamond @SteveScalise. Looking forward to seeing you on the field next week! https://t.co/QBqJC6JjTTBy letting ZTE off the hook, Trump is risking our natl security. Meanwhile the "world's best dealmaker" has secured zero promises from Beijing to change abusive IP/tech policies &amp; practices. Trade power resides in Congress and we must assert it here! https://t.co/dw0ux5AGSgI strongly support @NydiaVelazquez's calls for an independent commission into Puerto Rico. Americans deserve answers on the tragic loss of life, Puerto Rico's continuing needs, and the woefully inadequate federal response. https://t.co/BdFHg6ZtX7There is something grievously wrong with a system that allows creditors to cannibalize tens of thousands of jobs. #ToysRUs https://t.co/43BBOl9NmMOn this day 74 years ago, American and Allied soldiers embarked on the Great Crusade.

Phil Murphy: https://t.co/gHBMwxHL73 via @YouTubeThe President of this nation has declared that he is above all laws. Even our history's worst executives never made such an assertion. America's greatest strength has always been and always will be its dedication to the rule of law. https://t.co/vSy25m1958Donald Trump is explicitly arguing that he is above the laws of this nation. His claims of executive power would make Richard Nixon blush and make our Founding Fathers shudder. America cannot survive where one man stands above the rest. https://t.co/eQnwXGkLXKThank you @GovMurphy for fighting back against @HouseGOP efforts to destroy the ACA. This measure will reduce premiums and ensure that all New Jerseyans have access to care. https://t.co/3fs1cJ8uoHSpeaking now w/@SenatorMenendez &amp; @SenBooker demanding that the private equity firms that destroyed Toys R Us pay their workers. Private equity must stop their predatory ways that harm workers, lower wages, &amp; wreck communities. https://t.co/4lIPDUcYxEOn this Gun Violence Awareness Day, every American should stand up for Congress to finally pass reform.

On this day we remember their sacrifice and we celebrate their courage. A grateful nation thanks them. #MemorialDay https://t.co/JbOrf8f49TDonald Trump is lying. With the complicity of @HouseGOP, the cruel tearing apart of families is not required under law and is being done at Trump's sole discretion. This demagoguery dishonors America. These draconian measures must end. https://t.co/5Lub2zPlYSChinese telecom ZTE poses a recognized national security threat.

These extraordinary men recently received the French Legion of Honor for their bravery. #GreatestGeneration https://t.co/EKsAei2Jm3In case we needed more evidence that the #GOPTaxScam is bad for the middle class, here is yet another company that used its big tax cut to pay shareholders and then eliminated jobs. @HouseGOP doesn't care about the American worker. https://t.co/9kHypzhw4sBetween minting govt coins for summits that never happen and using his office to hawk merchandise to pump money into his pockets, Trump is cheapening the status of the highest office in the land to levels we can barely fathom. https://t.co/LbDyRBlqp9Today I signed the discharge petition to force a vote on #NetNeutrality. Trump and @AjitPaiFCC may disagree, but the Internet is for everyone -- not just the privileged few. https://t.co/6PyVMi0c6hWeeks ago @HouseGOP members demanded Trump receive the Nobel Prize.

The #GOPTaxScam already handed the biggest banks $3.6B the 1st quarter of 2018. The last thing Congress should be doing is weakening transparency &amp; predatory lending rules designed to avoid another economic meltdown. https://t.co/39YkAIHeFx.@HouseGOP has set a record for opaqueness and obstructionism. The House was prohibited from voting on my amendment to save SALT deduction bc of closed rule, denying New Jerseyans relief from the #GopTaxScam. A #ClosedHouse undermines democracy. https://t.co/F0ioBiOP5YAfter months of braggadocio, Donald Trump is signaling his capitulation to China.

The daily drip of revelations about corruption are all the more unacceptable knowing Congress could be doing its job through scrupulous oversight. https://t.co/o9QKbg3UndThe #GOPFarmBill would cut aid to over 30,000 New Jerseyans, while slashing billions to children, seniors, and vets and pummeling producers and rural farmers as a cherry on top.

He is using his public position to line his personal pockets.Citing economic indicators that reflected continued growth from the last years of President Obama’s term, @POTUS delivered a speech full of slogans and lacking details. While the stock market has gone up, inequality has also reached record highs, made worse by the #GOPTaxScam.The state of our union is more divided and our global standing is more imperiled as a result of this Presidency. #SOTUNeed a solution that brings DREAMers permanently into the fold of American life. @POTUS ended DACA to use as a bargaining chip to fund a wall he promised Mexico would pay for. I oppose using these kids as pawns in the upcoming immigration fight. #SOTUNJ taxpayers know the truth - the #GOPTaxScam lowers property values and raises taxes on many middle class families to pay for cuts for corporations and wealthiest. The law is an insult to our intelligence and a slap in the face to New Jersey. #SOTUNo speech can change how @POTUS continually chooses Putin over the American people. Any possible pleas for bi-partisanship in #SOTU are a joke given that his Administration refuses to implement Russian sanctions law passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in the Congress.This past weekend, I joined @repsandylevin &amp; Rep. @davereichert in Montreal to push for an improved #NAFTA that addresses Mexican labor standards. Any new NAFTA language must ensure that we can fully enforce higher standards with our trading partners.

https://t.co/yLGURmhrKNA public campaign debasing Deputy Director McCabe is no way to show support for FBI and law enforcement. It's shameful this WH pushed out a dedicated public servant. And it's more shameful @HouseGOP is either turning a blind eye toward, or actively enabling, interference at DOJ. https://t.co/jLZea7iHtgToday, I joined @SenBooker, @RepJoshG, Bergen County Executive James J.

I wish you and your family nothing but the best in the years ahead. https://t.co/hcuBL2AEpdBreakfast with Canadian members of Parliament, attended the Labor &amp; Legislators Summit, and visited with the Canadian American Business Council.

I am proud of the work being done by the @FBI to ensure our laws are being properly followed. Their work must continue unobstructed so the American public knows the truth about those who would undermine the process of justice in our nation. https://t.co/cNoZMmQZuaRobert Mueller should be allowed to continue his thorough and impartial investigation without interference.

We need to bring good-paying jobs back to our manufacturing base. https://t.co/JV9qBOkqvaOur trade policies must be redesigned to benefit American workers &amp; their families. Our trade agreements must be renegotiated to provide us with new rules – and much better enforcement of those rules – to ensure that the benefits from trade are shared broadly. #NAFTA https://t.co/k2ItgcuiO7Color me skeptical about today’s agreement and I won’t vote for any promised solution until I see it written down. Given how we got here today, I just hope we do not find ourselves in the same place three weeks from now..@realDonaldTrump has proven to be an unreliable negotiating partner, even going back on his word with members of his own party.However, no action was taken in the House to pass the bill. Further, @POTUS and his staff’s disrespectful and inflammatory rhetoric attacking both innocent children of immigrants and Democratic members of Congress does not lend itself to a constructive bipartisan deal.While Senate Leadership made a verbal commitment for a vote, the House Speaker has not agreed to keep the promise made to DREAMers. Let’s not forget that the DREAM Act passed the Senate in 2013 as part of comprehensive immigration reform with strong bipartisan support.Congressional Republicans have been too focused on passing irresponsible tax cuts - including today’s misguided delay of the medical device tax - to tackle critical issues like community health centers, disaster relief, and finding a permanent solution for DREAMers.We cannot continue to threaten pay and benefits, critical services, and economic stability of fellow Americans because of dysfunction among members of the White House and Congress.I want the federal government open for business, but today’s continuing resolution is only another short-term patch that does not solve the impasse. Congress must do its job and come to a long-term solution to keep our government open.Q: Do furloughed federal employees get back pay after #TrumpShutdown?

That is up to the Congress and White House. The precedent has been that furloughed employees are later paid, through enactment of legislation. For example, that was done in the most recent shutdown in 2013.Q: Which federal employees keep working during the #TrumpShutdown?

Federal agencies are required to classify their employees as either “essential” or “non-essential” during a shutdown, with “non-essential” employees (800,000 designated in 2013 shutdown) put on unpaid furlough.Q: What is the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on food safety activities?

During shutdown, the FDA is unable to support the majority of its food safety activities. The 2013 shutdown sharply curtailed critical FDA food safety inspections of domestic &amp; international food facilities.Q: What is the impact on the Centers for Disease Control?

During shutdown, CDC has to greatly curtail its activities to conduct flu season surveillance &amp; monitoring, promote immunization, support state &amp; local health depts &amp; update disease treatment &amp; prevention recommendations.Q: What is the impact on medical research?

During shutdown, NIH shuts down most medical research taking place, prevents the enrollment of patients in NIH Clinical Center studies, and stops reviewing medical research grant applications and making or renewing research grants.Q: What is the impact on federal housing loans?

During shutdown, the Federal Housing Administration stops processing applications for housing loans. In 2013 shutdown, FHA delayed 500+ applications to develop, rehabilitate or refinance ~80,000 units of multifamily rental housing.Q: What is the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on small businesses?

The shutdown halts federal loans to small businesses, stops review of applications for small businesses to obtain loans and loan guarantees (typically $1 billion/month).Q: Will military personnel be paid?

@washingtonpost reports no gap in pay unless shutdown lasts past Feb. 1, and otherwise military continues working unpaid until shutdown ends or until Congress &amp; @POTUS agree to cover their costs.Q: What is the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on U.S. military personnel?

Defense Department issued guidance, saying, “Military personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties.”Q: What is the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on veterans’ services?

All VA medical facilities &amp; clinics will remain fully operational. However, VA call centers &amp; hotlines cease to function, and Veterans Benefits Administration public contact services are not available.Q: How will the #TrumpShutdown affect FEMA clean-up efforts?

It’s unclear how ongoing FEMA recovery efforts (TX, FL, CA, PR &amp; VI) will be impacted. FEMA staff would still respond to emergencies, but the administration has not clarified status of long-term projects.Q: Will I still be able to visit the national parks during the #TrumpShutdown?

During the 2013 shutdown, national parks, monuments &amp; the Smithsonian museums were closed. However, the administration announced it will work to keep parks “as accessible as possible” during shutdown.Q: Will my mail still arrive during the #TrumpShutdown?

Yes. The approximately 500,000 Postal Service employees are exempt from furlough because the Postal Service is self-funded.Q: Will I continue to receive my Social Security and SSI checks during the #TrumpShutdown?

During a government shutdown, recipients will continue to receive their Social Security and SSI checks. However, a shutdown suspends the issuance of Social Security cards.Questions about the #TrumpShutdown? I have answers. 👉 https://t.co/wjDMlHFayZGovernment can't function lurching from crisis to crisis with month long funding bills. If Republican's want bipartisan solutions they need to come to the table and negotiate solutions for children’s health, DREAMers, and a long term budget.

#DoYourJob #TrumpShutdownAt every turn Democrats were willing to negotiate. But @realDonaldTrump shifted the goal posts to bow to the extreme right wing of the Republican party. It's long past time to pass the bipartisan solutions that exist and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/icytM312eKRepublicans let children's healthcare funding lapse &amp; kept the fate of #DREAMers in limbo while passing partisan tax cuts for donors &amp; billionaire friends.

Now they can't stomach bipartisan solutions to #ProtectDREAMers, fund #CHIP, or pass a budget. Ridiculous.

#TrumpShutdownWe need a long-term funding bill and an agreement on protecting DACA recipients. Democrats have come to the table and offered bipartisan solutions, but @POTUS and Republicans have dismissed them and chosen to go their own way. #TrumpShutdownMet with another group of #NJ DREAMers today. A few of these folks are students in my district. Why are we leaving their lives in the balance? #DACA #ProtectDREAMers https://t.co/yHJpmnP3jL.@POTUS continues to mislead the public. This report relies on faulty data to single out and demonize immigrants. It omits data on domestic terrorism, while obfuscating data on attacks carried out overseas. We can't let these falsehoods guide policy. https://t.co/oYYLB4Lvq5The Garden State is in good hands. #NJ https://t.co/SYO12IV4nROur student leaders embody three of #Paterson's most-prominent strengths: intellect, resourcefulness, and diversity. Congratulations to Treyvon Watson, Jonathan Saldarriaga, Ishmam Chowdhury, and Jannatul Mummi on being honored at the MLK Jr. Youth Recognition Awards Breakfast! https://t.co/uNOpFSODLfOn this #MLKDay, let us all be judged on the content of our character. #MartinLutherKingThere is simply no excuse for the expiration of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. We demand that the Congress pass a permanent extension of the program this week. #CHIP https://t.co/NHJzGfvoMfPrejudice has driven policy since the start of @realDonaldTrump campaign for @POTUS. Unfortunately, this is just another example. But thankfully there are those who push back on these abhorrent remarks and continue to let the world know his true colors. https://t.co/lzaukHUMQPJust speaking with Ziaira from Paterson before our event calling for re-authorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. We need to get this done! https://t.co/w6sRbMymfKOnce again, @POTUS has made a fool of himself &amp; our nation on a worldwide stage. He’s showing his bigoted tendencies in ways that would make Archie Bunker blush. White House statement makes it even more obvious that this president needs some help - what a national disgrace! https://t.co/j0N4K4c495#VisitNJ (and #KillTheDrill) https://t.co/60UNqpZDe8Spoke with @bsurveillance about the spate of congressional retirements, our current attitude toward immigrants, and the harsh economic policies being foisted upon the northeastern United States by Republicans leaders.

Check out the highlights below: https://t.co/ERYRSGjTQ9@POTUS As a cosponsor of legislation to create a permanent legislative solution to protect #DREAMers, I will continue to push for passage of the DREAM Act. Also, I will fight any effort to use these DREAMers as a bargaining chip to further the Republican Party’s anti-immigration agenda.@POTUS This type of injustice cannot continue. I will continue to fight for these hard-working, tax-paying young Americans who the Trump Administration decided to turn their back on.I remain opposed to @POTUS decision to place nearly 800,000 young immigrants’ lives in limbo. This decision tears apart families and continues to fan anti-immigrant sentiment across our country.Proud to stand up for #DACA recipients, including these #DREAMers who visited from New Jersey today. I assured them I'll push for a permanent solution before the Jan. 19 deadline.

#ProtectDREAMers https://t.co/RBdv3R9V0H.@realDonaldTrump, you may remember New Jersey’s economy is impacted by the shore tourism as well. Whether the decision is based on politics or to protect personal property from new offshore oil/gas drilling, we want the same deal as Florida. #AtlanticCity #MarALago #KilltheDrill https://t.co/002PhVng06Today I met with @1199SEIU_NJ to discuss continued and increasing support for #PuertoRico, where about 1.5 million people are still without power.

There are no two-ways about it – the federal response in Puerto Rico has been unacceptably slow. https://t.co/isBA8wbfSoThank you to the brave men and women in the law enforcement community who put their lives on the line every day to keep our families and communities safe. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/sFvTrYqIZ3By opening up the Atlantic to drilling, @POTUS is risking more than half a million jobs &amp; a $44 billion a year coastal economy in #NJ for a giveaway to the oil &amp; gas industry. I reject drilling off of the New Jersey shoreline. #KillTheDrill https://t.co/FHmJNb6Mi1New Jersey is going to hold the @HouseGOP accountable for passing a #GOPTaxScam that gives 83% of the benefits to the wealthiest 1% - benefits derived from eliminating middle class deductions like #SALT. https://t.co/tjoqI8aOkFBrendan Byrne was the best statesman New Jersey had in the last 50 years. He was a professional humanist &amp; an extraordinarily competent attorney. To Ruth &amp; the entire family: prayers, condolences, and joyous recollection of a man whose impact on our great state was unmistakable. https://t.co/D262cw0SxdA bipartisan group of 94 house members agree that it is time to stop playing politics with public safety and release these critical federal funds. https://t.co/2EOZcfqdggI'm appalled @ICEgov Acting Director Homan wants to put elected representatives in jail for not falling in line with the Trump immigration agenda. Needlessly withholding federal $ for law enforcement puts cities at risk. https://t.co/Kd4eiY3EGMMihail Golin served his nation proudly and made the ultimate sacrifice. Our armed forces keep us safe from harm, and our country owes Sgt First Class  Golin &amp; his family a debt that can never be repaid. My thoughts are with them during this difficult time.
