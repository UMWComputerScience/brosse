He should also support the #SAFEJusticeAct, which focuses mandatory minimum sentences on drug kingpins, instead of people like Alice.I commend @realDonaldTrump’s decision to commute the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a nonviolent, first time drug offender. This is the first sentence that he has commuted, while @POTUS44 commuted over 2,000 sentences under his clemency initiative.
