We are marching in Santa Clarita against separating families and #Trump's "zero tolerance" policy. This is what democracy looks like. #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/75DruPXoeKThe rally will start at 10:00 am at the corner of McBean Parkway and Valencia Boulevard and end in front of Santa Clarita City Hall.Tomorrow, I will be speaking against separating families and #Trump's "zero tolerance" policy at the #FamiliesBelongTogether march and rally in Santa Clarita.Today’s #SCOTUS decision in #JANUSvsAFSCME was targeted at the public sector, but it strikes at the heart of Americans’ right to collectively bargain for better pay, safer working conditions, access to healthcare, and basic retirement benefits. https://t.co/OGwQ2CuMuoToday, I joined @MarkWarner and a few House colleagues to tour the Youth for Tomorrow facility in Bristow, VA.  The facility houses over 100 immigrant children including about 15 children that were separated from their families at the border. https://t.co/dbJbbyHucT https://t.co/QmynZA2zIQThis can not be good. https://t.co/hKZV3jkrJ5Great meeting with my friend @YairLapid where we discussed Israeli-Palestinian peace, preventing a nuclear Iran, and bipartisan support of Israel in Congress. https://t.co/hQp5WpYAQOGood to meet King Abdullah of Jordan again with the Foreign Affairs Committee. We discussed efforts to assist with Syrian refugees, development, and improving the U.S.-Jordan relationship and Arab-Israel peace effort. https://t.co/y6E00sehl9SCOTUS ignored a simple fact: This is a “Muslim Ban” precisely because @realDonaldTrump called it a #MuslimBan. #NoMuslimBanEverToday, #SCOTUS set a historic and shameful precedent of sanctioning discrimination. Discrimination based on one’s religion is contrary to our nation’s founding values and the Court’s decision puts the religious liberty of all Americans at risk.Met with Ambassador Jeff Gerrish, the @USTradeRep for Asia, today. We discussed the need to reduce the #tradedeficit with China. https://t.co/TtwJdx82CuI hear @realDonaldTrump will propose to merge the Departments of Labor (@USDOL) and Education (@usedgov). I doubt it's for the purpose of strengthening our commitment to #education and #labor. https://t.co/gY6VP4xzCfI have been seeking to overturn Quill since 1992 when I was Chair of the California Board of Equalization, the nation's largest sales tax agency. I was personally sued by those who supported the decision. Finally, the #SupremeCourt got it right. https://t.co/JwFVdz6uUDI'm proud to stand by my fellow House Democratic colleagues to speak out against @realDonaldTrump’s "zero tolerance" policy that is ripping families apart. I support @RepJerryNadler's #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct because #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/7qD18IGMTaToday, Congress should send a strong message that the U.S. - a country whose story has been written by those fleeing oppression and hardship – will not abandon the world’s most vulnerable populations. I’m proud to join my colleagues in recognizing today as #WorldRefugeeDay.Today I joined with @RepJerryNadler and other colleagues in introducing H.R. 6135 which will outlaw the pernicious practice of separating children from their parents at the border.Just had a productive meeting with Ambassador Shinsuke Sugiyama of Japan. The Ambassador and I discussed the trade deficit, burden sharing, and confronting #NorthKorea. https://t.co/pKhhswGYpWTomorrow I will join @RepJerryNadler and other Members of Congress in introducing a bill to outlaw separating children from their parents at the border, a companion to @SenFeinstein's Keep Families Together Act.It was a pleasure to discuss the importance of U.S. South Korea joint military exercises with our new Commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Phil Davidson https://t.co/oALe99MqjkTrump is holding children hostage in an attempt to get Democratic votes on immigration bill. No wonder he established a strong personal rapport with Kim Jong-un. https://t.co/7yCMx9tIrGTonight at sunset marks the end of the spiritual month of #Ramadan; a cherished time for family and friends to gather and remember the common values of empathy and harmony that we all hold dear. I wish those who celebrated a very happy Ramadan Kareem.It was an honor to meet a very intelligent group of students from Granada Hills Charter High School (@GHCHS_UPDATES) who were in D.C. being recognized as @SIFMA Capitol Hill Challenge finalists. https://t.co/hM5qToEQB3.@realDonaldTrump tweeting today: There's no longer a nuclear threat from #NorthKorea.

Brad Sherman on the House floor today: If you believe that, you believe he's been faithful to all three of his wives. https://t.co/2fk4ppWAF0The violence against the #Rohingya in Burma is unconscionable.  Bangladesh has presented evidence to the International Criminal Court regarding the crimes against the Rohingya. #HumanRights are not optional, and every nation has an obligation to ensure justice in this case.#TrumpKimSummit.  The Iran Deal is like a clunker: it wouldn't serve its purpose for many years.  The #NorthKorea deal is like a picture of a Lamborghini.

Read my statement on the #SingaporeSummit below. https://t.co/etQmCghSCO#TheArtoftheCapitulation: Make major concessions.  Accept vague platitudes.  Announce you’ve negotiated the Best Deal Ever.#TheArtoftheCapitulation. We stop military exercises needed to defend South Korea.  We give green light to China to ease sanctions. We give Kim the prestige of meeting the U.S. President as an equal (not one of our more prestigious presidents, but still). We get vague platitudes. https://t.co/NzfVob46IbWho worked harder to prepare for the #SingaporeSummit : @realDonaldTrump or @dennisrodman? It worries me that this is even a serious question.Just because there’s clear evidence that he is guilty of Obstruction of Justice, doesn’t mean he’s entirely wrong on trade.China offers to buy only fungible commodities that we can sell on the world market &amp; involve minimal jobs per dollar of export. Buy our manufactured products &amp; stop demanding coproduction agreements. Buy our tech products instead of stealing the technology.https://t.co/5IAxCqfVwNIt was a pleasure to join former California Governor Gray Davis (@GovernorDavis) last night on @FoxNews and to discuss a number of issues important to Californians. https://t.co/kjxa5rMeMDTune into @FoxNews' @NextRevFNC with @SteveHiltonx tonight at 6PM.

Ramadan Mubarak!.@FoxNews failed to mention that most Republican Leadership on National Security--Chair of Armed Services Thornberry, House Foreign Affairs Chair Royce and apparently Senate Foreign Relations Chair Corker all agree--the wrong move at this time..@FoxNews and @TeamCavuto say its inconsistent for any Democrat to have opposed #IranDeal and then think #Trump is mishandling it now.Our sanctions are meaningless unless we enforce them.

We need to focus on stronger sanctions of Iran, abandoning the Iran deal would simply liberate Iran. https://t.co/VX3S9UqXAITwo points: the U.S. and allies must maintain pressure on the North, and on the other hand must be ready to agree to only interim steps in the near term.

We need to show that those who violate the Chemical Weapon Conventions will be punished.This Saturday at 2 PM tune into @gurveysLaw on @KABCRadio where I'll be discussing the latest on China and trade, North Korea, the Census, and the tax law.Reviving TPP will further increase the trade deficit—look at the trade deal w/ South Korea. None of the countries involved are going to alter their policies toward China, it will not address any of our trade problems with China, and will not change the security situation in Asia.The Trump Administration is reviving the TPP.  The idea that the TPP is a counter to China is nonsense.  It benefits and was in large part written by, multinational corporations seeking to ease outsourcing.Today we remember the six million Jews and millions of others brutally murdered during the Holocaust.  We can’t be complacent, we can’t be silent, we can’t ever forget, and we must combat genocide in our own time. #YomHaShoah #HolocaustRemembranceToday, I was honored to receive the @HumaneSociety's Humane Champion Award, my 11th consecutive award from the Humane Society.

Here we are pictured in front of the statue of the Suffragists in the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/erJT80sr0vOn average, women are paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts.  #Equalpay is not just a women’s issue.  It impacts our families, businesses, and economy.  #EqualPayDayIn 2016, @realDonaldTrump promised to eliminate the debt in eight years. Instead, @USCBO says that laws passed since he took office, including the #GOPTaxScam, will add $2.7 trillion more to deficits over the next ten years. Looks like President Trump really is the #KingofDebt.@HouseForeign needs a classified briefing on the chemical attack in #Douma. If this crime was indeed committed by Assad, then we must move to destroy his air force.Appeared on @KTLA yesterday to discuss the China trade deficit, nonproliferation &amp; the #2020Census.  Watch it here: https://t.co/qHaEekaS8KI had a good conversation with John Williams, who I hope will bring California wisdom to his new post as CEO of @NewYorkFed.

https://t.co/MkbePoPjuYCalifornia’s SB54 facilitates the deportation of those convicted of serious crimes. But California need not help deport a working father merely because he drove without a license. 4/4Democrats could have added to 2010 Census: How many guns do you have? NRA would have told members to discard survey and Texas would have lost 3 seats. But Democrats believe everyone counts. 3/4Trump administration claims it’s adding question on immigration status to #census to enforce the Voting Rights Act and thus empower Latinos. If you believe that, you probably believe Trump has been faithful to all 3 wives. 2/4Was on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace. Airs 8am on Channel 11 in LA. Re-airs on @FoxNews at 11am, 4pm, and 11pm Pacific. Re-airs on East Coast on @FoxNews at 2pm and 7pm. 1/4I will be on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace to discuss immigration and the census. 9am ET. 8am PT on Channel 11 in LA.During the final quarter of 2017, we had Democratic tax policies in force, Janet Yellen running the Fed, Dodd Frank in full force, and demo CFPB regulations in place. 

https://t.co/QW0gwEyVNzVilifying all immigrants is factually wrong, and causes fear which undermines the census and many other government functions. We need an accurate #2020 Census.Authorities should focus on arresting criminals. Not breaking up families, deporting hard working people who are part of the fabric of the community.@IngrahamAngle attacks California for suing #Trump administration. Fails to mention that California usually wins, because #Trump violates law again and again.Since she can’t change the Constitution, she and others on the #Trump right want to prevent census from being accurate by depressing participation.She admits the object of citizenship question on Census is to undercount immigrants, because she disagrees with clear words of Constitution- the enumeration must include “all persons”Thread: Went on @IngrahamAngle tonight. She tries to prove that #Trump was right to say Mexican Immigrants are typically rapists and murderers, by showing pictures of half dozen terrible criminals. Her crack staff could easily find a dozen terrible crimes committed by blonde guysToday, I stand with those marching across the world to #EndGunViolence and I remain committed to working in Congress to end this epidemic. Today, we  #MarchForOurLives, but every day moving forward we will fight to say #NeverAgain.#Trump’s assault on our servicemen and women is cowardly and disgusting. His #TransMilitaryBan is bad for the military and bad for our country. No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. #ProtectTransTroopsAt least #Trump isn’t ignoring the #China trade deficit. But does he have a plan to deal with China's response? And was it wise to go after U.S. allies on metals just days before?Good to briefly meet with Mohammad bin Salman this evening, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/jUDODVoH95For over 20 years I have been proud to receive an ‘F’ grade from the @NRA and I will never let them stop me from supporting common-sense gun legislation to #EndGunViolence. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/1TVUgmGItgToday, I was honored to sit down with a few of my colleagues and Vice President @JoeBiden to discuss how @HouseDemocrats can promote an economic agenda that stands up for American workers. https://t.co/QYqhMu1c0PTune into @cspanwj now.

Among the issues we discussed was my bill H.R. 3827, The End Right To Work Nationwide Act. https://t.co/EeRwYLYoQa#NunesMemo is irrelevant to Trump, Mueller, and collusion. Slightly relevant to whether FISA court protects our privacy. So why is #NunesMemo touted by GOP members who have always voted against privacy?#NunesMemo irrelevant to the credibility of Mueller and investigation of Trump collusion says Ryan “This memo is not an indictment of the FBI, of the Department of Justice. It does not impugn Mueller’s Russia investigation or the deputy attorney general.”#NunesMemo tries to prove that the FBI, under James Comey, made a small mistake regarding an advisor Trump had already fired. Desperate attempt to use an irrelevancy to discredit Mueller—who wasn’t in government at the time.#NunesMemo is a biased political diatribe masquerading as Intel. FBI, under Trump-appointed McCabe, says “we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” Schiff memo is accurate, balanced &amp; fills-in the “material omissions.”Our thoughts and prayers are with those injured in the recent accident involving the train carrying our Republican colleagues to their retreat.Long speech with few policy proposals.  Very few that will have bipartisan support. #SOTUTrump talks tough on North Korea. But he's unwilling to pressure China sufficiently.  In 2017, North Korea made more progress toward being able to nuke American cities than any prior year. #SOTUThe original deal was Dreamers for border security.  Now Trump wants border security, a Wall, end family reunification, cancel the diversity visa, slash Legal immigration.  And our firstborn. #SOTUNow he’s implying immigrants are disproportionately engaged in violent crime. That is false. #AlternativeFacts  #SOTUHe claims he will deliver better trade policy.  But he’s delivered nothing in last year. And see our China trade deficit since he took over. https://t.co/cAnBIGgryUAlmost thirty minutes into this speech and not one policy proposal.  Are we engaged in governing here? #SOTUThe President just said that the economy has added 2.4M jobs since the election–that includes 3 months during Obama's presidency. In the first 11 months of #Trump’s presidency, 1.8M jobs were created, compared with 2.1M jobs in the 11 months before his inauguration.  #SOTUPraising Americans who have done heroic things will get bipartisan applause.  But hope to hear policy proposals that get bipartisan applause. #SOTUUnlike most #SOTU, copies of speech text not available on Floor.#Trump has called the @BLS_gov unemployment statistics “fake” 19 times. Tonight he will cite those same @BLS_gov statistics. Truth is that President Obama cut the unemployment rate in half. #ThanksObama. And we had slower job growth in 2017, than any of the prior 5 years. #SOTUTune in to @KFIAM640 at 3:00 PM to hear my thoughts on tonight's #SOTU on the @johnandkenshow.At his 1974 #SOTU Nixon said Watergate investigation should terminate. Six months later, the Judiciary Committee voted that Nixon Obstructed Justice, and he resigned. Tonight, Trump will say “No Collusion” “Fake News”. #ObstructionofJusticeThe law only deterred because some people were afraid it would be implemented. That fear is now gone. Not to mention the Trump Administration's decision is on its face illegal. Laws must be enforced--even if #Trump thinks they’re unnecessary, or even if Trump fears Kompromat..@StateDept says it does not need to sanction anyone for doing business with Russian defense or intelligence sectors. They say that some big transactions have been canceled, so the law is achieving its purpose. Wrong.Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Stephanie Yellin-Mednick, a school nurse with the L.A. Unified School District and a member of the @schoolnurses (National Association of School Nurses), to discuss children's health and school nurse staffing issues. https://t.co/xgeMRN0xbGOn #China trade, #Trump talks tough and will do so again in #SOTU.  But he does nothing.  Our trade deficit with China has gone up steadily every month of his presidency. https://t.co/RSGNdRE2saJust read the so-called #FISAMemo. Least significant document anyone has ever bothered to tweet about. The memo and a response from Democrats on the Intel Committee ought to be released this week, with appropriate redaction.Thanks to @CoveredCA for helping make our Health Care Navigator Day a success!
