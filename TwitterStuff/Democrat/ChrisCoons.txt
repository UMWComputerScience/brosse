More than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents &amp; it is not clear that the administration has a plan to reunite all of them with their families. This is unacceptable. #FamiliesBelongTogetherI stand with everyone marching today to take a stand against the unacceptable, un-American humanitarian crisis at our Southern border. #FamiliesBelongTogetherDetaining entire families indefinitely is not a solution to the crisis that our president has created. #FamiliesBelongTogetherEric Murphy, nominated to be a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, argued that the constitutional right to marriage equality would be “disruptive” to our democracy.  I believe it strengthens our democracy.  #PrideMonth #CourtsMatter https://t.co/GmWHmzmVvhThrilled to help get this much needed funding for @AmeriCorps - $1.7m for Delaware will go to assist agencies like Habitat for Humanity, Ministry of Caring and Teach for America. AmeriCorps gets things done! https://t.co/B63l2D7bb1Gordon Giampietro, nominated to be a judge in the Eastern District of WI, said same-sex marriage was “an assault on nature” and claimed that “bad things are going to happen” if we have a constitutional right to marriage equality.  This is unacceptable. #PrideMonth #CourtsMatter https://t.co/Zv78nEcyeCFor President Trump to go to a summit with Vladimir Putin and not have on top of the agenda holding him accountable for attacking the United States by interfering in our last election would be unacceptable.It is appropriate for President Trump to speak to the leader of Russia. 

It is not appropriate to have a summit with Putin where President Trump is not centrally focused on the threat that Putin and Russia pose to NATO and the United States. https://t.co/njeDNgZYpRI also fought for programs that help students afford and succeed in college, like Pell Grants, TRIO, Public Student Loan Forgiveness, and campus-based aid programs. Glad to see the Appropriations Committee work to support funding for these programs.I’m pleased that today’s appropriations legislation protected the Corporation for National &amp; Community Service funding &amp; rejected the admin’s proposal to eliminate the agency. I’ve seen firsthand how national service can improve our communities.For the Republican majority to refuse to give a hearing to an eminently qualified, centrist nominee in Merrick Garland for almost a year and now turn around and do the exact opposite in a similar fact pattern, I think, is just the height of hypocrisy https://t.co/zamGU5l78jI fought to secure funding for programs that improve our nation’s health, like NIH, the BRAIN initiative, and for mental health treatment, prevention, and research. I’m proud that members of the Appropriations Committee worked in a bipartisan way to advance medical research.The $145 million in increased funding we were able to include in the appropriations bill is part of our ongoing commitment to fight this epidemic, which is impacting too many families. I’ll keep working to combat this crisis with everything I’ve got.One of the most tragic things about the opioid epidemic is that it is both preventable and treatable with the right programs and resources. Today we secured additional funding to ensure that prevention programs and resources are available and properly funded.In Delaware, nearly 350 people died from opioid overdoses in 2017, up from 154 in 2016. While heroin use has increased statewide, northern communities have taken the greatest hit. I’m proud the Appropriations Committee took an important step today to help reverse this trend.Ryan Bounds, nominated to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, claimed that #LGBT Americans liked to “fancy [themselves] oppressed” and therefore see discrimination where it does not exist.  Judiciary Democrats voted no.  #PrideMonth #CourtsMatter https://t.co/sz9yVl0eRuThis bipartisan bill will help to ensure that low-income and at-risk students get the help and guidance they need to access and complete their technical training and/or a college education. We are one step closer to helping students of all backgrounds to achieve their dreams.That’s why, in 2012, I introduced the American Dream Accounts Act with @marcorubio. I’m pleased to announce that this bill was included in the CTE reauthorization bill that passed out of the HELP committee yesterday.Too many Americans today remain cut off from higher education. Only about 1 out of 10 children from low-income families will complete a college degree by the time they are 24. That is unacceptable.Same to you, James!

https://t.co/057khAHPt2Matthew Kacsmaryk, nominated to be a judge in the Northern District of Texas, argued that marriage equality would set us on the “road to tyranny.” He called transgender identity “a psychological condition in need of care” not “special legal protection.” #PrideMonth #CourtsMatter https://t.co/QxuKKnsgFhWith time, we have made our union more perfect by fighting discrimination in all of its forms, but the decision today demonstrates we have a long way to go before we live up to our highest ideals.The President’s travel ban is not only discriminatory and counterproductive; it stands in direct contrast to the principles embedded in our Constitution and our founders’ vision of a nation where all people are free to worship as they choose.In the coming weeks, I plan to introduce legislation to make clear that in the United States, we will not tolerate religious or nationality discrimination, and I invite everyone who treasures our American values to join me in defending them.Today, #SCOTUS may have ruled that the President’s travel ban was technically legal, but that doesn’t mean that it’s right, that it’s justified, or that it reflects America’s values. https://t.co/HGR2T4QRF7This article is a powerful and timely reminder that the people (most often women and children) who flee to the United States are seeking safety, peace, and a place where they can work hard, raise their families, and contribute to a community.Regardless of your political affiliation or thoughts about our immigration laws, please take a moment to read this article about the violence, poverty, and suffering that people are experiencing in countries like Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. https://t.co/NQ99NPvaNaHoward Nielson, nominated to be a judge in the District of Utah, fought against marriage equality.

We cannot tolerate this.We live in the most powerful, prosperous nation in world history, and our President is treating children and their indefinite detention or separation from their parents as a bargaining chip in a long running disagreement over how to fix our nation’s broken immigration system.Under this order, President Trump’s new policy is to indefinitely detain entire families in facilities that may include ill-equipped tent cities, and his order doesn’t clarify what will become of the more than 2,000 children already separated from their families.Over the last week, the American people spoke clearly and said that the President’s policy was an unacceptable, un-American tragedy that should not continue.  The President finally succumbed to pressure yesterday by issuing an EO, but that order simply creates new problems.I have joined many colleagues in calling for hearings before the Judiciary Committee to expose the cruelty of this 'zero tolerance' policy and explore more effective and humanitarian alternatives.The Admin has misled the American people and excused this cruel policy in a variety of ways, including claiming that they didn’t have this policy, that they were following a non-existent law, or that their policy was being used as a deterrent for people who are fleeing to the USPresident Trump created a humanitarian crisis by adopting a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy for people fleeing violence in their home countries.  That ‘zero-tolerance’ policy included cruelly separating young children and even babies from their parents at the border.The American people deserve clarity about what has happened along our southern border in recent weeks.Honored to have a Delawarean, Lourena, here for the event to stand #withrefugees https://t.co/nH8tigjR6qThank you to @UNRefugeeAgency @RefugeesIntl @wrcommission for joining the Senate Human Rights Caucus yesterday to highlight #WorldRefugeeDay and the plight and resilience of the Rohingya.As we rededicate ourselves to supporting &amp; welcoming refugees on #WorldRefugeeDay, the nomination of Mr. Mortensen sends the wrong message to persecuted peoples around the world who look to our country as a beacon of hope and security.On #WorldRefugeeDay, @SenJohnMcCain &amp; I are calling on the Trump admin to withdraw the nomination of Ronald Mortensen to serve as the United States’ senior diplomat for migration and refugee policies. https://t.co/dalYc2NXmATo look in the eyes of #refugees, to witness them reaching a safe place after fleeing violence, is a powerful experience--&amp; one that has encouraged me to continue fighting for humanitarian assistance abroad &amp; funding to support refugees here in the United States #WorldRefugeeDayToday on #WorldRefugeeDay, we recognize the strength &amp; perseverance of the more than 22 million refugees worldwide, forced to flee their homes due to persecution, violence, or war. I’m proud to stand with #refugees.Our President is taking America &amp; dragging us through the mud worldwide &amp; destroying our reputation as a humane country. I’m going to do everything in my power to fix this. But let me repeat: our President can keep families together with one decision, one phone call TODAY.This is inhumane and cruel to use children as pawns in our long-running disagreements about how to secure our borders and fix our immigration system. Separating families is not required by law..@realDonaldTrump - *You* can change this today. It doesn't require legislation. You are not compelled to do this by law.What can be done to keep families together is simple: President Trump can reverse this policy decision that he’s made. He can stop misleading the American people by suggesting that this is required by law. That is just not true. https://t.co/jYQXO6tkusThat’s why I’m proud to join with @marcorubio, @RepMcCaul, &amp; @Call_Me_Dutch this Thursday to co-host the second annual bipartisan Capitol Hill National Security Forum where we will address the state of our nation’s security.

I’m with you in this fight! https://t.co/HVqx4IDwBtThis is plainly, demonstrably untrue.
 
Mr. President – this is *your policy* and you can end it with a simple phone call at any moment. The entire nation and the families who are senselessly suffering are demanding it. https://t.co/0pd5s0SaX9At a time when more than 65 million people are displaced worldwide, the nomination of Mr. Mortensen for this position sends a chilling message to all those around the world who look to the United States as a beacon of hope and security for persecuted peoples.We are deeply concerned by Mr. Mortensen’s record of spreading misinformation about immigrants and displaying a lack of empathy for innocent men, women, and children fleeing violence and oppression.Today, @SenJohnMcCain &amp; I are calling on the Trump administration to withdraw the nomination of Ronald Mortensen, a virulent opponent of immigration, to serve as the United States' senior diplomat for migration and refugee policies. https://t.co/DfrG7Y64KZThank you, @JohnCarneyDE for this decision. The President’s decision to separate children from their families at the border is cruel and inhumane – the President should reverse it immediately. https://t.co/EdZAppgFjEIt seems to me that listening to each other, in humility, with a kind &amp; open heart, would truly be in the spirit of the Gospel.It’s my hope that the Trump Administration will choose to end this policy and instead work with us in Congress on a bipartisan basis to find a legislative solution to our badly broken immigration system.I’m very concerned that a decision has been made to use children as a weapon in a long running war about how best to secure our border &amp; how best to fix our broken immigration system.It was a narrow reading that missed the context – the verses just before &amp; after call on people of faith to be humble, to associate themselves with folks in need, to show hospitality, kindness, and love.To justify their family separation policy, AG Sessions &amp; @PressSec cited Scripture, in particular Romans Chapter 13, for the principle that we must all be subject to governing authority &amp; follow the law. https://t.co/4YRyYHEkUzUS Patent # 10,000,000 issued this morning!

This is not the law; it is a choice made by the Trump Administration. It’s inhumane and immoral.
https://t.co/vEAs0VxiObThe actions focused on in this report took place months before Special Counsel Mueller was even appointed by Deputy AG Rosenstein, whom President Trump appointed. The Mueller investigation must proceed without interference. Period.I expect Pres. Trump to claim that this report somehow taints Mueller’s investigation, but that simply does not match the facts.This is not proof of a ‘Deep State’ or evidence of a conspiracy against the President. Most importantly, this does nothing to undermine the important investigation that Special Counsel Mueller is conducting into Russian interference with our election.Equally important is the fact that the IG found absolutely no evidence that the decision to conclude that investigation without prosecution was the result of bias at the FBI or DOJ.This is an important accounting of actions taken by DOJ employees related to the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server, including some that appear to have been violations of longstanding DOJ policies.Over the next few days, I’ll be digging into the details of the Inspector General report, but as the coverage of this report begins, it’s important to be clear about what this is &amp; what this isn’t.Today, I joined my colleagues on legislation to halt the separation of immigrant families. This is not what we stand for as a country &amp; represents a complete disregard for the human rights of these families. https://t.co/xK2hUAURJuSeparating children from their parents at the border is not required by law, it is a choice that the Trump admin has made &amp; continues to make every day.

We cannot go back to the days when people were denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition.The Trump administration is trying to destabilize our health care system. We can’t let that happen. We must be loud and clear: If they succeed, millions of Americans will lose their pre-existing condition protections.Celebrated with our future leaders at last night’s service academy reception. These talented Delawareans will attend either @WestPoint_USMA, @NavalAcademy, @AF_Academy or USMMA. Best of luck on their journey to earn that coveted gold bar — commissioning as an ensign or 2LT.190,000 Delawareans with pre-existing conditions got better coverage under the Affordable Care Act – each &amp; every one of them could lose that protection as a result of the Trump administration’s decision last week.The Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect, but dismantling the law &amp; refusing to defend Americans with pre-existing conditions is not how we fix our health care system. Democrats are at the table, we are ready &amp; willing to work together on this as we always have been.Two years ago today, we lost 49 Americans in a hateful act of gun violence. We mourn those who died at Pulse nightclub and commit to #HonorThemWithAction by fighting to make our communities safer.It is critical that we sound the alarm on the Trump administration’s attempts to sabotage our health care system. If the Trump administration prevails, millions of Americans could lose health care coverage &amp; protections.Literally, the Trump Administration is arguing that insurance companies should be able to discriminate against people with pre-existing health conditions. 

This is astounding.

https://t.co/Au5rLG7qrmPresident Trump would have been stronger going into this summit had he left the G-7 with a united declaration of support for sanctions &amp; for our negotiating stature. Instead, he left with the G-7 in disarray.  That makes this harder, not easier.For this agreement with North Korea to mean anything, there will have to be a lot of hard work and discipline in the months ahead. It is my hope that the Trump administration is prepared to do that &amp; will follow through.The agreement is purely aspirational because President Trump failed to get concrete action on human rights, &amp; we have no definition, no timeline, and no details on denuclearization: https://t.co/KALVjTrctTThe agreement signed in Singapore is a dream outcome for Kim Jong Un – legitimacy on the world stage, an invitation to the White House, and a pledge to stop military exercises, all in exchange for a vague pledge that North Korea has broken at least twice before.When the President is making big, dangerous promises to North Korea’s dictator that the Pentagon and South Korea don’t even know about…that’s a problem.
https://t.co/RWxmpflsm7These efforts may seem innocuous when taken independently, but collectively they represent an attempt to increase the appeal of autocracy and strengthen Chinese leverage over U.S. Our letter calls for @FBI @StateDept @USTreasury @DeptofDefense coordination in response.All of us, including members of Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intel, Banking &amp; Judiciary Committees, are calling on the Admin. to develop a strategy to counter Chinese actions, which aim to manipulate public discourse.I signed a bipartisan letter to the Trump Administration raising concerns about China’s attempts to undermine U.S. democratic institutions and supplant our alliances abroad. Letter here: https://t.co/S8LgqKrBDdI’m disappointed in the Supreme Court’s ruling, but I’m more disappointed in Ohio’s decision to purge voters from its rolls.

There’s a lot to get done this week, and I’ll be hosting some amazing Delawareans in the Capitol over the next few days – I hope you’ll take a minute to watch this preview of the week. https://t.co/C1TDHsJXyxThis move is also likely to further destabilize our health insurance marketplace and drive up premiums for many consumers. As multiple health care experts have pointed out, when insurers see uncertainty in the marketplace, they increase premiums to compensate.Older Americans are more at risk &amp; the ban on insurance discrimination against women could disappear. The Trump admin is taking their partisan agenda too far – this decision is impacting whether our constituents have access to affordable health care &amp; I won’t stand for it.This action from the Trump admin would allow Delawareans and Americans w/ pre-existing conditions to be charged more or denied coverage altogether based on pre-existing health conditions.Just take a look at the numbers: 133 million nonelderly Americans have pre-existing conditions. When the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, more than 190,000 Delawareans with pre-existing conditions got needed protection.This is a big deal. If the Trump administration has its way, coverage &amp; protections for millions of Americans could disappear. https://t.co/MeF4JVcDVZLast week, the Trump admin announced that they would no longer defend core components of the Affordable Care Act, namely protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Make no mistake: this is the administration completely sabotaging our health care system.I believe in a free &amp; open internet. Restoring #NetNeutrality shouldn’t be a partisan issue. I’m once again calling on @SpeakerRyan to hold a vote to guarantee Americans’ access to an open internet.I voted with a majority of the Senate to pass legislation to restore #NetNeutrality and ensure a free &amp; open internet. Now, it’s time for the House to do the same. https://t.co/LKbvRereIsThe Trump administration must end this cruel policy that separates families searching for a better life in the United States. Our country is better than this.As of Feb. 2018, almost 1,800 immigrant families have been separated by U.S. authorities after crossing into the U.S. from Mexico since Oct. 2016. My colleagues and I are asking the administration to stop tearing families apart. https://t.co/VIhqS4eJTx“We will be remembered by what we say and what we do in this challenging time in America’s history.

Mueller is the right person to investigate Russia’s apparent assault on our democracy.”Important read from Dick Thornburgh, AG to Presidents Reagan and Bush, in @washingtonpost: “As John Adams said, our country is ‘a government of laws, and not of men.’ This founding principle of our democracy must be protected.” https://t.co/CXJ5ErOvbsThis policy does not reflect what we stand for as a country. We have a humanitarian duty to the children &amp; families seeking asylum in our country – it’s time that our President understands that.We are calling on the Trump admin to end its inhumane policy that separates children from their parents at the border.

This isn’t being tough on China, it’s a bad deal and giveaway to a country that at times refuses to play by the rules at the expense of US workers and securityLegitimate U.S. national security concerns about ZTE should have been addressed by a searching compliance program to ensure IP theft &amp; surveillance issues are fully addressed. I’m not persuaded the financial fine and compliance program announced today accomplish these goals.This was a critical moment where the U.S. had China over a barrel. We should have used this leverage to demand that China stop its illegal trade practices, stop stealing our intellectual property, and pressure Korea to make concessions on its nuclear weapons programAt its worst, this deal is a threat to our national security &amp; the privacy of all Americans. Releasing pressure on ZTE is a missed opportunity to hold China accountable for unfair trade practices that hurt U.S. workers, threaten our security, and undermine our competitiveness.Unless the administration got some real concessions from China with regards to N Korea’s nuclear program and addressing our national security concerns, President Trump’s deal, at its best, represents a major concession to China. https://t.co/BuHeU3OhVOThis week, we celebrate the 55th anniversary of the #EqualPayAct. We’ve come a long way since 1963, but still have so far to go. That’s why I’m proud to be an original co-sponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct which would close loopholes in the current law.These appropriations bills matter to Delaware.  They direct much-needed support to state and local governments and non-profits to fund the development projects that allow our local communities to thrive.

Just in Delaware, these grants have been awarded to build the Newark and Claymont rail stations, improve the Port of Wilmington, &amp; upgrade road infrastructure in Georgetown.This week, I fought to secure funding for critical Delaware priorities, like supporting our National Guard &amp; investing in our highways, airports, &amp; rail service that all Delawareans rely on.Currently in the Senate, we are working on passing appropriations bills representing the wide range of federal programs that Congress must review &amp; approve annually. I’m proud to serve on this committee &amp; fight for the programs that matter to Delaware &amp; the country.This shouldn’t be a partisan issue – all Americans should be able to access an open internet.  #NetNeutralityDespite the bipartisan passage of our resolution to save #NetNeutrality in the Senate, @SpeakerRyan has failed to bring the resolution to the House floor for a vote. Today, I’m joining my Democratic colleagues in calling on @SpeakerRyan to immediately hold a vote.After pushing for almost a year, I was pleased to see the National Emergency Medical Services Commemorative Work Act pass the Senate yesterday. This bill allows for the construction of a commemorative work in D.C. to recognize the commitment and service of our brave EMS workers.This #PrideMonth, we celebrate the end of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the recognition of marriage equality, and our ongoing fight against discrimination. https://t.co/5Z2rxKsKpSToday I’m thinking about a Delaware couple I know who spent 50 years serving in our military and intelligence communities, all while having to publicly lie about who they were.The briefing focused on how teacher leadership can improve the profession &amp; student achievement!

We are all keepers of the republic and defenders of the rule of law.“Prīvilēgium Obligātiō. Privilege comes with obligations. If you like the rule of law, you need to keep it.”“The rule of law is our most important principle. Patriots should always defend the rule of law, even when it is not in their immediate self-interest.”“We are all keepers of the republic. But the farther we get from the founding generation, the less we appreciate how much it depends on people rather than just words.”“Many nations do not follow the rule of law. Some claim that they do [...] But as Justice Antonin Scalia noted, the rule of law is not just about words on paper. The rule of law depends on the character of the people responsible for enforcing the law.”Take a few minutes today to read the remarks that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein delivered in Philadelphia last night. A few lines in particular stood out to me… https://t.co/bBbPTdYYedMy statement about this morning’s Judiciary Committee hearing that has a direct impact on Delaware, our entire region, and bipartisanship in the Senate https://t.co/8cccPKRIaoRemembering Lawrence Anderson, Walter Brinton, John Butler, George Beebe, George Dill, Walter Dobek, Charles Donoghue, Stephen MacGregor, William Morris, James Padley, Franklin Polster &amp; William Verderamo.

These victims need our support.When a child is the victim of physical or sexual abuse, his or her life will never be the same. Seeking justice should be part of the healing process – not a source of further trauma.Great meeting with @DrMichaelLomax to discuss ways we can work together to strengthen investments in our nation’s HBCUs.

https://t.co/xdD2abYpY2The GOP tax bill puts more than $2 trillion on our nation’s credit card, and it’s mostly a giveaway to wealthy Americans and corporations.

We should invest in teachers, our kids, and our schools instead https://t.co/ac8NiRwT8zInstead of working with our allies to push back against Iran’s nuclear program and its other bad behavior, the Trump Administration is threatening to *sanction our allies* https://t.co/r3xMquHPFwI pressed President Trump’s Treasury Secretary, @stevenmnuchin1, on this issue today in the Senate &amp; he would not say whether the Treasury Department removed Suspicious Activity Reports related to Michael Cohen: https://t.co/sGBTV77Y67I’m deeply concerned by a recent report from @RonanFarrow in the @NewYorker that important financial info about Michael Cohen could not be located by law enforcement.  https://t.co/EiMiISwtUrCongratulations to Robin Morgan on being named @UDelaware’s provost.

Today, the Trump Admin is expected to announce its plans to undermine a woman’s right to choose &amp; tie medical providers’ hands when it comes to giving their patients all the info about their optionsThanks to @WDEL and all the panelists for an important discussion on opioid abuse in our state.  Together, we’re going to beat this. If you missed it, you can watch our discussion here https://t.co/3rjmElC6xaWe all have the opportunity to bring this crisis out of the shadows and shine a light on it, to talk about it no matter how uncomfortable and painful. That’s what we’re doing today on @WDEL.That led to a 12% decrease in the number of opioid prescriptions in eight months.We also need to limit the prescription of opioid painkillers. Under the leadership of @DE_DOJ Matt Denn, Delaware enacted regulations in '17 that allow prescribers to better monitor each opioid Rx and limit an adult from receiving a 1st time prescription for more than 7 daysAlso proud to support the most recent spending package, which included a total of $3.3 billion in increased funding to fight the opioid and mental health crises for FY18, including an increase of $2.8 billion in treatment, prevention, and research for programs within HHS.I've also fought against bills that take away health care access for Delawareans and against any harmful cuts to the programs that people rely on for care and treatment.We need to approach this with the right policies and the right attitudes. We don’t need a War on Drugs approach – we need to let people know how dangerous these drugs are, and for those who are already addicted – we need to get them the help and care they need.The opioid crisis is a public health crisis.  The people who are suffering from addiction are not drug addicts who should be punished – they’re our loved ones, our neighbors, and our friends – and we need to care for them.If you can’t stream the interview on @WDEL, visit https://t.co/3rjmElC6xa for Facebook Live video.Looking forward to joining @WDEL’s Peter MacArthur and local leaders for an important discussion on the opioid crisis in Delaware. We’ll be streaming live at https://t.co/3rjmElTHVK for Facebook Live video.Tune into @WDEL tomorrow at 8 a.m. as I join a discussion w/ Peter MacArthur and other stakeholders in Delaware’s fight against the opioid epidemic. #NetDESo inspired and moved by the new documentary on my good friend @SenJohnMcCain, entitled “John McCain: For Whom The Bell Tolls.”

Thanks for participating @amnesty @amberinzaman @indefchristians @freedomhouseThe reason this matters is that we are talking about the intersection of several important developments: big data, social media, and foreign interference in our 2016 election.

The internet provides the world unprecedented opportunities to communicate, share ideas, &amp; collaborate freely.I’m proud to work across the aisle to support small businesses &amp; bolster U.S. economic competitiveness.

Ensuring that our laws keep up with changing technology is vital to the music industry &amp; this is important bipartisan reform. https://t.co/aqeoayP3TjAs we recognize the law enforcement community during #NationalPoliceWeek, we must honor their commitment by serving them as well as they serve us. I’m committed to working w my colleagues to make sure our officers have every resource they need to do their jobs &amp; come home safely.This is welcome news. During his first 18 months in office, Trump decimated our diplomatic ranks.  I commend @SecPompeo for ending the hiring freeze, and we need to restore diplomacy as a primary tool of U.S. foreign policy ASAP. https://t.co/zWUP2VarGPCompletely agree, @PattyMurray: “We’ve found common ground on health care before. The only reason we can’t again is if one party chooses not to look for it. That won't be Democrats.

Simply put, the U.S. &amp; the Trump admin must do a better job of engaging in Africa. https://t.co/irHvwT4iGQHonored to meet today with @NazaninBoniadi to discuss the importance of fighting for human rights in Iran and around the world. https://t.co/9cZCio1DXiOK, so the Trump Admin is protecting two states so far from off-shore drilling: 
 
✅  Florida
✅  Maryland
So, @SecretaryZinke - let's move another mile up the coastline and protect #Delaware, too. Even better, how about if we just stick with the current off-shore drilling ban?The Special Counsel should conclude his investigation when the investigation has concluded. No later, no sooner. https://t.co/sTsUpLIcmoNew Ebola outbreaks underscore the urgency for Congress to make long-term, sustainable investments in medical research &amp; global health infrastructure.  I’m going to continue to fight against the Trump Admin’s cuts to our global health contributions. https://t.co/abv7pqL2DWThe Senate should take action.

The bill, which I introduced with @SenBobCorker, would modernize the United States’ development finance institution to create economic growth in the developing world.This new facility and the plan to invest $45 million in our state to increase manufacturing capacity makes this a great day for Delaware and the Delaware workforce. This is another positive sign that DuPont is committed to operating, expanding, and staying in the First State.DuPont has been rooted in Delaware since 1802 and today, those roots grow stronger with DuPont’s purchase of a larger manufacturing facility in Newark.  https://t.co/U5sxDEWsaOThe patent system is critical to progress in our nation because it supports &amp; encourages the ordinary citizen to innovate. I’m glad to see leaders in the innovation policy &amp; IP field come to D.C. today to discuss its future.Proud to join @iipcc_org today to discuss the importance of the patent system in the U.S. We must remember it was the patent system that helped propel the U.S. from a relatively sleepy, agrarian economy into a powerhouse that overtook the superpower of the day—England.The future of the internet hangs in the balance. Today, Democrats are taking action. RT if you agree that access to the internet isn’t a privilege, but a right. #NetNeutralityToday, I’m joining my Democratic colleagues in calling for a vote on the Senate floor to save #NetNeutrality. I urge you to call your Senators today &amp; fight for a free, open internet.Our European allies are questioning now whether we are a reliable partner in making diplomatic measures that will drive Iran in a better direction – the President needs to consult Congress on what to do next with regards to North Korea &amp; Iran.I hope that we can now find some path toward reengaging our allies, renegotiating with Iran, and getting to a stronger deal. But, I frankly think President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal makes that less likely, not more likely. https://t.co/ChLAdpBjy0And if that weren’t enough, our President &amp; Senate Republicans are continuing to raise costs &amp; reduce access by expanding junk insurance plans, undermining consumer protections in the ACA, &amp; blocking bipartisan efforts to lower premiums.Senate Republicans have made it their mission to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. But what has that resulted in? Millions more uninsured, many more without access to quality care, and higher premiums for American families.The Senate Republicans’ health care plan continues to hurt Americans &amp; limit access to affordable health care for all. Ask doctors, nurses, &amp; advocates – they’ll all tell you the same thing. We have to do better by working *together* to improve our health care system.Thanks to their hard work, they now have industry-recognized credentials that make them career ready right away as high school graduates.

It was a privilege to hear your insight on what we can do to create stronger career paths for young American men &amp; women.We’ve made important progress in addressing the #skillsgap, but we still have much more to do. Proud to speak today at a bipartisan panel discussion on this topic: https://t.co/HbXVsBeR9jThat’s what we call the #skillsgap &amp; that’s where #apprenticeships come in. The data speaks for itself: more than 90% of those who complete #apprenticeships land jobs with starting annual wages that exceed $60,000.According to the National Skills Coalition, there are 5.9 million job openings in the U.S. &amp; 6.6 million unemployed Americans. But, here’s the problem: many of these unemployed Americans don’t have the skills they need to fill these open jobs.Apprenticeships are what I like to call "the other four-year degree,” because they often lead to a well-paying job, a clear career path upon graduating, little to no debt, &amp; skills that you can use for a lifetime.On Capitol Hill, we spend a lot of time talking about how important it is to invest in four-year degree programs, which indeed are critical investments. But there are other pathways that young people can take to build a successful career, such as #apprenticeships.Today’s announcement is further proof that President Trump does not have a clear strategy for dealing with Iran, and that is dangerous not only for the United States, but also for the world.I share President Trump’s goals of ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon and denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, but we differ greatly in how we approach these problems. Bluster is not a strategy and the alliances we have built over the past 70 years matterWhy would our international partners honor any deal we might strike with North Korea?What reasonable expectation is there for a new, stronger deal with Iran?How can we lead an international coalition to push back against Iran after abandoning an agreement with which Iran has largely complied?How do we now ensure that Iran does not restart its nuclear weapons program without the inspections and access guaranteed by the agreement?What is his strategy for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon?Today’s decision from President Trump produces only new, increasingly difficult questions.Like the President, I’m deeply concerned by Iran’s continued support for terrorism, its commitment to prop up the Assad regime, its human rights abuses, &amp; its ballistic missile program, but I question how walking away from the deal makes it any easier to deal w/ those challengesThis is a mistake. It will likely make it harder for the US &amp; the international community to monitor Iran’s nuclear program, it divides us from our European allies, and it raises legitimate questions about US’ ability to lead the international community in the face of crisis. https://t.co/XtBjAQB0BxToday is #NationalTeacherDay &amp; this week is National Teacher Appreciation Week!
