https://t.co/y6OCHo2Nt7Incredibly powerful to see people marching together in Connecticut, in Washington, D.C. and in every single state across the country. We will not stop fighting. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/dqq38Uio9iThis summer, Connecticut servicemembers and their families get free admission to 50+ museums across the state. https://t.co/1cHee1LIvpThis can’t be true!!! President Trump told us “North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat”. He said he took care of it. https://t.co/DiKOx4p2OcDear Aaron Judge: as a diehard Sox fan I request you to make it easier for me to hate you than you are currently. https://t.co/vRtmCZ1oV4Noank Community Services is an amazing organization and this child is much better off here than in a prison on the border. They are doing their best in a bad, awful situation.The lack of transparency from the Administration, and the lack of giving a crap from Republicans in Congress, is so deeply disturbing. These are little children - and their lives are being changed forever by this unspeakable trauma.HHS’s excuse was that we need to give 14 days notice. What?? 14 days of forced separation from your parent can traumatize a kid for life. And we aren’t asking to see nuclear codes - we just wanted 10 min to make sure the child is ok.Disturbing #WhereAreTheChildren update. 

Earlier today, HHS denied me @SenBlumenthal @RepJoeCourtney the ability to visit a child separated from their family who is being housed w a non-profit in our state. 

The perverse secrecy of child separation should concern us all.Just this week I helped secure $1.5 billion in new funding that will help states like Connecticut fund opioid prevention and treatment programs. I've talked with people across the state about the need for new resources and this is a step in the right direction.Stopped by @BackusHospital in Norwich to talk with doctors and advocates about how the hospital is dealing with the opioid epidemic and what I'm doing in Washington to address this crisis.It's about to get very hot in Connecticut this weekend. Please stay hydrated and if you need help, local cooling centers are open. https://t.co/YRQn8cwc2LStarted the day with a Congress on Your Train talking to commuters on the brand new @HartfordLine https://t.co/iRyLCUW0lHPulling for everyone at the Capital Gazette. Horrible. 

So awful that my colleagues still don't understand their unconscionable silence has become a green light for would-be shooters, who perceive inaction as endorsement.Exactly. McConnell should have held a vote on Garland. But now that he’s set a precedent, he should stick to it. https://t.co/q9meTHmtGv3/ Pompeo's answer:  "I’m confident that I could identify a set of tradeoffs for you where you’d agree that that was the right outcome as well."  That sounds like the sovereignty of Ukraine is on the table, a total reversal of US policy.2/ I asked him whether Trump would cut a deal with Putin to bring Russia back into the G7 even if Putin didn't start pulling out of Ukraine.  Basically, will we sell out Ukraine to get something else from Russia?1/ Lost in yesterday's news din was an exchange I had with Pompeo that should concern every Democrat and Republican that cares about Ukraine and/or worries about a bad deal being cut at the newly announced Putin-Trump meetingYesterday was a gut punch. But more than anything else, it was a reminder that elections matter, and we need to start winning them - everywhere. 

So adjust your summer and fall priorities, and let’s get to work.About to go live with @maddow to discuss Kennedy’s retirement and what’s happens next. Tune in at 9 ET to watch.Felt right to spend tonight w SEIU head @MaryKayHenry and my new hero, Angel, who is leading the fight to organize fast food workers in Hartford. We won’t ever ever give up. https://t.co/JBYymRbmYoMcConnell has to follow the rule he set for the Senate. 

We shouldn't vote on ANY Trump nominee to replace Justice Kennedy until the voters have had a chance to weigh in and a new Congress is sworn in. 

Sign my petition if you agree.
https://t.co/w0eFPo20Q1Here it is, plain and simple. 

McConnell set the rule. 

Now, he and Senate Republicans need to follow it.

No vote on a Supreme Court nominee until after the new Congress is seated.Not surprising @SenateMajLdr has already reversed his rule on confirming justices before an election. The real question is, is there not ONE GOP Senator who sees the hypocrisy in all this? Because it likely only takes one.Wait, so the thing about “the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice” wasn’t really about a concern for the American people? 

It was just about Obama?? I am shocked! SHOCKED!! https://t.co/c88ofnzMB3The Republican tax law in action:
1. Add trillions to the debt in order to give millionaires and corporations a giant windfall.
2. Threaten to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for it.
3. Put the entire economy at risk of a financial crisis. 
https://t.co/pGbM7nbjstLet’s call it like it is: the Supreme Court is turning itself into a political arm of the Republican Party. Weakening organized labor, upholding GOP gerrymandering, gutting voting rights laws.It's not Melania's jacket.  It's not the Red Hen.  It's the relentless campaign by Republicans to pad the pockets of their health industry buddies by taking away your insurance and driving up costs for people with preexisting conditions. #wegutteditNo no no no. Everything is fine. President Trump said he has a “special bond” with Kim. He “trusts” him. So just don’t worry about it. https://t.co/hJOKgVTT58The new @CDCgov director wants to study gun violence.

https://t.co/imJRDO5YnfRepublicans in Washington added $1 trillion to the deficit so that they could give a giant tax cut to rich people and big businesses.

https://t.co/9AQYmdMN3yHundreds of people came out to join me in Hartford tonight and rallied to #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/YhcVFp1KoFI organized a rally tonight in Hartford to raise hell on child separation. Amazing turnout on 24 hours notice.

https://t.co/R4rAnTcZVGLet’s not get sucked into a moral vortex where something less than diabolically evil is somehow acceptable. 

If the new policy puts kids and parents in cages indefinitely that’s better than kids in cages alone, but still illegal and immoral.Just imagine for a moment, how important that stuffed animal must be to that little kid, for it to be the only thing she brings with her at the scariest instance of her life.  https://t.co/YKn2m62xoUI can confirm, the @GoYardGoats park in downtown Hartford is a great time. https://t.co/CJHqLTKo6vAlso super important - THERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES KIDS TO BE PUT IN CAGES. https://t.co/W2yDbTu9HxJust an FYI - Republicans aren’t talking about a clean bill to free these kids. 

“We want to change the law” = “We want to help Trump use these caged up kids as leverage to get our other terrible immigration ideas into law.” https://t.co/W2yDbTu9HxNo kid should go hungry this summer. That's why @EndHungerCT provides breakfasts and lunches for families in need. Find a location near you at https://t.co/KOvk1Bh6yj https://t.co/in5WEKeEz6Let’s be clear what “playing ball” means here: funding Trump’s stupid wall as ransom to let little kids out of cages, encouraging the President to terrorize other little kids to get other things he wants. 

Yeah, I don’t want to play that game. https://t.co/XqJv8weCTEIf the Trump administration succeeds in getting rid of protections for 130 million people with pre-existing conditions, insurance companies will be able to deny them the care they need to survive. 
https://t.co/a8rXKGyRIqIt’s time for Democrats to open their eyes and realize the world has changed. The only thing to be afraid of on the gun issue is the political consequences of NOT talking about it. https://t.co/xMl5hqOe3hThe Trump administration has made their position clear - if you're one of the 130 million Americans with a pre-existing condition, insurance companies should be able to charge you more or deny you care. 
https://t.co/EU2KkL70ic"Child abuse"
"Toxic stress" 
"Irreparable harm"

These are the words the American Academy of Pediatrics is using to describe the effects of Trump's family separation policy. 
https://t.co/hzEoIZFuAOThe President of the United States has stolen 2,000 little children from their parents and locked them in cages, to be released only if Congress gives him money to build a wall with Mexico.

I’m pretty sure I have that right.Republicans claim they want to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. But their efforts to repeal and undermine the ACA make it clear that they don’t, and they never did. https://t.co/hGqSXddnJCMeanwhile... https://t.co/MTrCrn9gvFRetract this statement, Madame Secretary.

Yes, technically YOU are not at the border separating families YOURSELF. You are in charge of a policy that turns parents over to DOJ, resulting in the separation of children. You know this, and still - incredibly - sent out this tweet. https://t.co/CikreZ286KIf we don’t start winning elections soon, history will judge the next-level shamelessness of this month as decisive in the collapse of American democracy. https://t.co/qz2jnkOe2fThis Father's Day, I can't stop thinking about the children being separated from their parents by the Trump administration. 

It's time for Congress to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to put a stop to this inhumane policy.

Add your name if you agree: https://t.co/qvSKayrjHhLegal experts agree that the latest challenge to the ACA is bogus - but it could still let insurance companies deny health care for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/YNoWccUNf6This is a big deal for our state. I was proud to vote for funding to get the Hartford line built and it's exciting to see it become a reality. https://t.co/s2uweDfxwaThe idea that morality is defined by blindly following the law, regardless of the law’s morality, has been the basic operating principle of most fascist regimes throughout history.Stopped by the CT River Museum in Essex to talk with environmental activists and community leaders about the work I'm doing to protect our shorelines from climate change. https://t.co/PiaqilsLfyFunny how executing people who disagree with you causes your people to sit up straight and behave. https://t.co/YYT742Vm0jOh, and @brianschatz - turns out there is video evidence of the double. cc @nielslesniewski @ChrisVanHollen https://t.co/DbFPmPoHbPEasy to criticize from the sidelines, @brianschatz!

But they told the Saudis about this building 12 TIMES. They knew.3/ MSF shared the coordinates of this building with the Saudis 12 TIMES since April. Saudis acknowledged receipt of coordinates 9 TIMES.  Simply not true that the coalition didn't know about the cholera facility.2/ Doctors Without Borders (MSF) have been building a new cholera treatment facility in a compound in Yemen used by the Red Crescent and MSF. Saudis watched the construction, could have raised questions to MSF about the building.1/ Short THREAD on the impressive chutzpah it took for the Saudis to send out this tweet.

https://t.co/HApiMp03mj4/ Further, the specifics of the "agreement" make clear Trump doesn't have the chops to get a final deal that's good for us. We gave up military exercises in exchange for NOTHING (Kim's vague disarmament commitment is weaker than previous commitments).3/ The message of last 72 hours is clear: if you're a historic U.S. ally, you get humiliated.  If you've been a bad actor, you get rewarded, even if you show no meaningful sign of reform. That sends a chill down the spine of any nation asked to help the U.S. in the future.2/ The syrupy photo op with Kim, on the heels of the brutal treatment of our closest allies at the G7, is an international relations disaster. I'm fine with POTUS talking to our enemies, but not right after you savaged your friends.1/ Trump wants supporters of diplomacy, like me, to get caught in a trap where we can't criticize Singapore. I call BS. Trump isn't Obama. North Korea isn't Iran. And the context of the G7 disaster matters.It has been two years since 49 people were shot and killed at Pulse nightclub. What will you do to honor their memories with action? What will you do to end gun violence in this country? https://t.co/Wv0YlRUEwlKim’s gulags, public executions, planned starvation, are legitimized on the world stage.

The U.S. has begged Saudi/UAE coalition not to attack the humanitarian aid port of Hudaydah. New reports suggest they have refused our plea, are readying an assault. Result could be catastrophic.The Yemen War is spiraling out of control. The Saudi/UAE/U.S. coalition bombed a Doctors Without Borders cholera treatment facility earlier today. 

Let me repeat that - the U.S helped bomb A DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS CHOLERA TREATMENT FACILITY.The President of the United States wants insurance companies to be able to tell people with pre-existing conditions they can't get the health care they need to stay alive. This is heartless.
