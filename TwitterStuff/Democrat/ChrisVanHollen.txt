Despite the horror they experienced, the staff at @capgaznews put out a newspaper today. Today we mourn the loss of our fellow Marylanders, but tomorrow we fight another day to honor their legacy through action to stop the violence. https://t.co/WMqgbOtoq4The Capital Gazette is a local institution and vital to how our community gets our information. While we don’t know what motivated this attack, we must stand together to end the violence. https://t.co/SQehINwnhRPhil, I can’t imagine what you and the entire Capital Gazette team are going through right now. Journalists shouldn’t have to fend off bullets in the newsroom while doing their jobs—this is not normal. Stay strong. https://t.co/hchUMIaMN1My heart is with the families, friends, and loved ones of the victims as we learn more about this terrible situation. We must unite to end the violence. https://t.co/MINrFfTfUrTrump tweeted that "Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Elections!" So revealing how Trump puts the word of Putin above veracity of his own hand-picked intelligence community leaders. Congress needs to send a clear message and pass the DETER Act.The McConnell Rule is clear—the American people must have a say in the upcoming election Kennedy's seat is filled. And when the Senate considers the President’s nominee next year, we need someone who will get broad support—not someone that will put special interests first.I’ll be speaking at a hearing on the real human impacts of Trump's family separation policy and what's next. Maryland's own Dawnya Underwood, Director of @LIRSorg, will join us to talk about her work. Tune in ↓ https://t.co/sjb2CkgUIIToday’s SCOTUS decision in Janus v. AFSCME was a major blow to unions and working people, while further rigging the system for wealthy special interests. We must fight back against attempts by billionaires to upend an underlying principle of our democracy—the right to organize. https://t.co/OUOI1jo42PBREAKING: On the same day as the Supreme Court’s ruling on Trump’s discriminatory travel ban—we learn that the State Department is only clearing visa waivers for about 2% of applicants from majority-Muslim countries impacted by the ban. This isn’t right—and we must keep fighting. https://t.co/0hQ06uiSkIThe family separation policy may be over, but our work to reunite parents and kids is not. @SenJeffMerkley and I are sharing what we saw on the Texas border—and urging Trump to meet with the moms we did and find their kids immediately. Keep up the fight!
https://t.co/8EL4tjuBqHThe bipartisan push to hold ZTE accountable continues. @MarcoRubio, @SenTomCotton, and I are urging @SecretaryRoss to grant waivers to companies that want to remove ZTE technology from their networks. We cannot facilitate foreign companies that are fronts for spying on Americans. https://t.co/y1i2mOxLudMen, women, and children from across the world—including Muslim-majority countries—look at the United States as a beacon of hope and a symbol of freedom. We cannot allow Trump's bigotry to undermine America's fundamental values. https://t.co/KcY88J0zJOCouldn't agree more with Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg that this decision discounted Trump's malicious intent. In the Senate, I'm fighting to make sure the ban is not shrouded in secrecy and that people who present no threat are allowed entry into our country. https://t.co/QFN6kSAdlYIf you need some good news to brighten your day, the full Senate approved $5M in new funding to pay interns in the Senate. A big step toward helping level the playing field and provide opportunities for those students who don't have the financial means to live in DC without pay.Trump tweeted that he was "surprised" that Harley-Davidson is moving some jobs and manufacturing overseas. Really? The guy who claimed to be a great negotiator is having his lunch eaten. The Art of the Deal has become the Art of the Steal—stealing American jobs.Five years ago, the Supreme Court inflicted a serious blow to the Voting Rights Act. Since then, we’ve seen countless attempts to suppress voting rights—including the bad ruling issued today. We must keep fighting to expand access to the ballot box. #RestoreTheVRA https://t.co/CMMnNeE3alTrump constantly belittles our hardworking federal workforce and proposed a pay freeze even though the cost of living is rising. I’m glad we stood up for our civil servants by voting to give them a modest pay raise. This is an important step but the fight is not over. https://t.co/kv5k6rJbCmIt's been 6 months since Trump added $2 trillion to our debt with his corporate tax giveaway. Since then, big corporations and wealthy stockholders have reaped windfall profits while middle-class wages have remained stagnant. A very bad deal for America. https://t.co/bNy9e8AQMFFor months, the Trump Administration’s waiver process has been shrouded in secrecy—which raises concerns about its legality and what they are trying to hide. I’m glad the Appropriations Committee passed my bipartisan amendment to make this information public and expose this sham. https://t.co/wnMgW2XohfTrump vowed not to touch Medicare and Medicaid—so much for that promise. After giving huge tax cuts to big corporations and saddling us with trillions in debt, the GOP wants to gut these vital programs. This budget is no surprise—but working families deserve the truth. https://t.co/sAi1jrBF9hPleased to receive bipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee yesterday for my amendment ensuring that Turkey cannot obtain F-35 jets if it also buys the Russian S-400 missile system. Allowing this would compromise our national security. https://t.co/oFN9RT7nLDThe @LittleLobbyists have been a vital force in our fight against Trumpcare. I met with them this week to talk about the Trump Administration’s newest efforts to roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions. For children like Xiomara, we must keep fighting. https://t.co/JatTfNpY60While Trump finally bent to public pressure to reverse his despicable child separation policy, his new order does nothing to reunite children who have been taken from their parents and appears to subject children to indefinite imprisonment. Unacceptable. This still isn’t over. https://t.co/aY08lPtJrGI don’t care how many times the President denies it—he is deliberately separating children from their parents and holding them hostage as a political bargaining tool. Despicable. He has the power to end his inhumane family separation policy with one phone call. https://t.co/bm0WX2dKCBThe Senate passed the amendment I offered with @SenTomCotton to keep the penalties on ZTE for its violations of U.S sanctions. We are pleased that both parties made clear clear that protecting American jobs and national security must come first. Trump should end his opposition.Trump keeps saying we need new immigration laws to change his cruel family separation policy. Totally false. He ordered it 6 weeks ago and he could end it today. He is holding these separated kids hostage to gain leverage in the larger immigration debate. Despicable!Second, new DHS policy is making it almost impossible for families fleeing violence to seek asylum at legal ports of entry. So desperate moms hire folks to take them across the Rio Grande. Then—as described here—they are arrested and then their children are taken away. https://t.co/EaQUi4tyjvNielsen's claim here is very deceptive for 2 reasons: First, I spoke personally to a mom who crossed at a legal point of entry. She and her daughter were fleeing death threats in Honduras. Her daughter was taken away and she is now locked up in a detention center. https://t.co/4vJQUOYIRXThis morning, I met with Sister Norma at her Catholic Charities Center in McAllen. She is truly an angel, caring for desperate families fleeing horrific violence. As she and I discussed, the families who make it to her center are the "fortunate ones." https://t.co/gwhJQ7LLIkMr. President, I was for cracking down on MS-13 before you learned it wasn't a movie sequel—but at the border I saw 5-year-olds you have taken from their parents. Sure didn't look like MS-13 gang members. We can have secure borders without your cruel family separation policy. https://t.co/NT841QINzwFinished the last stop of the day, the Port Isabel Detention Center. I heard gut-wrenching testimony from ten women who fled extreme violence in Honduras only to have their children taken away from them. Definitely one of the most emotional moments of the trip. https://t.co/jlazkdA52ZJeff and I just finished visiting the US-Mexico border to investigate the Trump Administration's cruel family separation policy. We talked to @kasie about our trip, if you didn’t have a chance to follow along—I encourage you to watch this segment for the details. https://t.co/lhyQUkYnkwJust visited the Brownsville Children's Facility. Trump Administration didn't let us talk to the kids and they even tried to stop me from recording outside the building. They are clearly sensitive about this trip. This place is packed with kids—over 100 taken from parents. https://t.co/7RVP0ZgT8eSaw kids at Brownsville Children's Family and I’m reflecting on how Sessions cited the Bible as justification for tearing children from their parents. I dare Sessions to look these children in the eye and tell them that the Bible demands this cruelty.Traveling to next stop. Based on current trends, today, on Father's Day, about 45 children will be taken from their parents. Trump's policy has taken about 2,000 children from their parents in 6 weeks from April 18th and May 31st—and that cruel practice continues. It must stop!At the Hidalgo Bridge. A few weeks ago, the Trump Administration essentially stopped families seeking asylum from crossing at this legal point of entry. Left people stranded for days without food and water. So many then crossed the river, were arrested and had children taken. https://t.co/iHCDevS1A1President Trump says he has to take children from their families because of "Democratic" laws. That is a lie. There are NO laws that require this policy of family separation for asylum seekers. This is a deliberate Trumpian practice. He could end it today.They were not doing it while we are watching but at Border Patrol Processing Center in McAllen, there where lots of kids have been forcibly taken from their parents. @realDonaldTrump, is this Making America Great? We must demand an end to this inhumanity! https://t.co/PvQR6tlXXoJust left Border Patrol Processing Center in McAllen—aka "the dog kennel." Witnessed loads of kids massed together in large pens of chain-linked fence separated from their moms and dads. @realDonaldTrump, change your shameful policy today! #FamiliesBelongTogetherArrived in McAllen, TX. Mr. President, perhaps you are celebrating #FathersDay with your children. My children encouraged me to come here to the border to meet with kids you have forcibly separated from their parents. Why not honor the day by ending your cruel practice? https://t.co/9s7sV7LXHeOur family celebrated Father’s Day yesterday because our children agreed it was important that today I travel to the border to meet with kids who can't be with their parents because they've been ripped apart by the Trump Admin's cruel new policy. Trump—stop this inhumane policy!This Father’s Day, I’m headed to the border with @SenJeffMerkley to focus on the inhumanity of separating kids from their moms and dads when families are legally seeking asylum and get a first-hand look at what is happening. Follow along Sunday for updates from our trip.It’s official: the fight for a new FBI HQ continues. We made clear in today's CJS Appropriations bill that Congress has serious issues with Trump's current proposal and that any new plan should include one of the earlier identified sites—including the 2 in Maryland.Big news! Proud to announce that the Appropriations Committee has allocated $5M in new funding to pay interns in the Senate. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this effort, and I’ll keep working to make sure all students have the opportunity to intern on Capitol Hill. https://t.co/5Rn342GyPjThis is abhorrent and this should not be happening in the United States of America. Why isn’t Republican leadership bringing up @SenFeinstein’s bill to end the practice of separating families legally seeking asylum? https://t.co/DWX7U2EFteTo no one’s surprise, North Korea used our President for their propaganda campaign. Kim Jong Un is pocketing immediate concessions and not making any concrete commitments. Nauseating to see Trump stiff our allies in Canada and then praise Kim while saluting his generals. https://t.co/IOrIMO3yxsCall this what it is—a gross human rights violation. I’m proud to cosponsor @SenFeinstein’s legislation to prevent children being taken from their parents at the border, but we need your help to get the entire Senate on board. Please call upon all senators to support S.3036. https://t.co/1XAFI9mkLIFinally, something we can all agree on. The Senate unanimously passed a resolution to congratulate the @Capitals on their Stanley Cup victory. Proud to present it to @TedLeonsis on behalf of @EleanorNorton, @SenatorCardin, @MarkWarner, @TimKaine, and myself. https://t.co/mORZRew8sFAfter decades of perseverance, the @Capitals can finally hoist the #StanleyCup above their heads—and it was great to celebrate tonight with the Cup, the team, and some of my favorite DMV senators. Congratulations to the players, coaches, and all the fans! #ALLCAPS https://t.co/a1b0rabys7We can't let ZTE off the hook for violating U.S. law—doing so would pose a serious threat to our national security. That’s why @SenTomCotton and I teamed up to stop that from happening. Tune in as we discuss our bipartisan amendment. https://t.co/K4HEPf97oXIf this were true, McConnell would oppose Trump’s deliberate sabotage and work on a bipartisan basis to strengthen—not blowup—the Affordable Care Act. Actions, not words, are the test, and the GOP gets an F. This is a fight the country must not lose so keep speaking out! https://t.co/DBYUonjpuyTwitter’s character limit, Olivier. It’s brutal. https://t.co/j1ibK47Lx7Goal! I’m thrilled that FIFA has decided that the US-Canada-Mexico bid for the 2026 @FIFAWorldCup was the best path forward. This is an exceptional opportunity to highlight the positive impact soccer has on communities across the world, and stimulate tourism and economic growth. https://t.co/Gb0lgYck5oToday President Trump tweeted that "there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea." This is truly delusional. It has same arsenal today as 48 hours ago. Does he really think his big photo-op ended the DPRK's nuclear program? Hope does not equal reality.Let me tell you, I wish I was at the #CapitalsParade with the @Capitals celebrating their historic win. While I’m bummed I can't attend, I’m glad to partner up with @EleanorNorton to introduce a resolution congratulating the players and coaches on their historic win! #ALLCAPS https://t.co/FhmihUW4vsThe grand photo-op with an American president was a long sought coup for North Korean leaders. Jury still out on whether we and our allies achieve our goals. So far big words but few details except the fact that Trump gave far more than he got by suspending US military exercises. https://t.co/ecx2YwrdwTI’ve heard from over 27,000 Marylanders over the last year asking me to protect Net Neutrality—they’ve reached out by phone, email and handwritten letters. I have received no constituent correspondence against it—that’s quite telling. Tell the FCC to listen and save the Internet!Good news! Trump may want to move forward to help ZTE and Chinese jobs, but Congress is saying no. My amendment with @SenTomCotton to reimpose sanctions on ZTE—and protect our national security—will be included in the NDAA bill. Debate starts tonight.We should we doing everything in our power to make it easier to vote, not harder. I strongly disagree with this decision—it paves the way for mass disenfranchisement in Ohio and sets a legal precedent for other states to do the same. https://t.co/WU44EX8DDZAs we celebrate the progress we've made in the fight for equality for LGBTQ Americans, let’s never get complacent. Silence is not an option. As the recent Supreme Court reminds us—we must protect the progress we've made as the fight for equality for all continues. #Pride2018 https://t.co/nZzB4ewXC8While Pruitt undergoes at least 16 federal investigations for violating the public trust, he continues to undermine public health. The latest: he just gave a thumbs up to allow chemical companies to poison you—indirectly. I will be fighting to reverse this, spread the word! https://t.co/vcTOL5DGYYMaryland is all in on the @Capitals, and I know this is the year DC is going to break its sports curse! If the Nevada Senators want to make a wager, I’d be happy to put some Maryland crab on it. Let me know, @SenCortezMasto and @SenDeanHeller. #ALLCAPS https://t.co/2l36jGWwiKZTE has repeatedly violated U.S. laws and any deal that lets them off the hook is unacceptable. @SenTomCotton and I just introduced an amendment to the NDAA to ensure that regardless of any action Trump takes, Congress will hold ZTE accountable and protect our national security. https://t.co/6MNHH6fSDRThey aren’t even being subtle anymore. After a massive giveaway to billionaires and big corporations, Republicans are now looking to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay the bill. More people should be paying attention. https://t.co/xJTKfei1KCThis is the type of behavior that @BrianFrosh and I have been warning about at our Consumer Protection Forums. Mulvaney is systematically dismantling the CFPB—putting payday lenders and scammers before consumers. I will fight this tooth and nail—please help me get the word out! https://t.co/2uPHQkB8BIGood news! For months, I've been working to pass the bipartisan Childhood STAR Act and it was signed into law by the President yesterday. It's an important step forward in the fight against pediatric cancer and will bring hope to thousands of children across the country. https://t.co/3sJf7gnjZCIt’s scary that Trump says he can violate every federal law with impunity by shutting down the investigation or pardoning himself. This undermines our bedrock principle that no person is above the law. I hope both Republicans and Democrats will condemn this dangerous rhetoric. https://t.co/H6fYE3pxiAHad a good meeting with the folks at W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, a manufacturing company with 14 facilities and 2,400 associates in Cecil County. They make fabrics that help protect our soldiers and firefighters, medical devices, aerospace electronics and more. Great MD manufacturer! https://t.co/FGUPXWIUFbEnjoyed meeting with employees and patients at @UpperBayCouns, one of the largest behavioral and mental health providers in the Cecil County. Discussed our efforts to ensure funding for mental health and substance services as we confront the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/OXsgbNjWJOAt last night’s town hall in Ellicott City, I was inspired by the strength and resilience of a community that has one again united in the face of extreme adversity. If you missed it, you can find additional info here: https://t.co/chIezzAyVD.
https://t.co/3KEWgoTEsIThank you for having hosting me, Dr. Devine—and for your service to the students of Cecil County. Our discussion about the challenges and opportunities you’ve faced as superintendent was extremely valuable. And congratulations on your retirement after 42 years! https://t.co/zBNuWGM3tnIt begs the question—did Trump pardon him because D’Souza supports the President and echoes his hateful speech? Or is it to send a message to people who may be thinking about coming clean to Robert Mueller? Looking for ways to stop this abuse of the pardon power. https://t.co/jvh0xkc9CIWow. There have now been more than $450 billion in new stock buybacks announced in 2018, compared to $6.9 billion in one-time bonuses and wage hikes. The President really should change his motto to “Make Corporate Stockholders Richer than Ever.” https://t.co/KzwNtJahIPInstead of trying to strip away the rights of federal employees and whistle-blowers, Trump should focus on the abuses of cabinet officials who have been taking charter and first-class flights and buying $31,000 dining sets and $43,000 soundproof booths. https://t.co/YyuiPuEkbBThe new death toll estimates in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria are staggering. These aren’t just numbers—these people were members of our American family. Trump wanted to declare victory—but we must keep fighting for Puerto Rico to get what it needs to rebuild and save lives. https://t.co/01MM2NFKEMThe Trump Administration’s despicable new scheme to rip children away from their parents to discourage immigration defies human decency. Join me in calling on every Member of Congress, regardless of party, to condemn this cruel and inhumane practice. https://t.co/JCAcSVqUtiSergeant Eddison Hermond was a hero whose life was taken too soon. He put others’ safety before his own and sacrificed his life, showing the true goodness of his character. My heart goes out to his family and the entire Ellicott City community. https://t.co/tJr8xDvb6uToday I witnessed the amazing fortitude and resilience of the people of Ellicott City as they begin the cleanup process. Amid the devastation, neighbors were helping neighbors—this is what being a community is all about. Team Maryland stands ready to help in every way. #ECStrong https://t.co/DGsf5cjwqgThis #MemorialDay, we honor those who gave their lives in defense of our country—and recommit ourselves to supporting our vets and the soldiers who serve us today. Last week, I had the honor of reading the names of Marylanders who died in the Vietnam War. For each, a bell tolled. https://t.co/X5sXrRKEbzThank you to the first responders who are taking swift action to aid the Ellicott City community. The entire Maryland Delegation is working with @FEMA to bring in federal resources. If you’re in the area, please follow the guidance of local authorities and @MDMEMA. https://t.co/hKdnmJUDPAMr. President, this is false. ZTE presents a national security threat to the United States—and nothing in your reported deal addresses that fundamental fact. If you won't put our security before Chinese jobs, Congress will act on a bipartisan basis to stop you. https://t.co/Ww14wy3st4Still, Prince managed to graduate high school and married his high school sweetheart. He's part of our community and shouldn't be deported while his wife's petition for him to stay is pending. #WeStandWithPrince https://t.co/cKJtGWlgO5When violence broke out in his home country of the Central African Republic, his father sought asylum and subsequently has died. His mother was murdered in CAR.Don't let our fellow Marylander, Prince Gbohoutou, become a victim of Trump's effort to punish those who have done nothing wrong. Prince was a child when he legally arrived here.My office has been working hard for weeks to get @ICEgov to release Prince. Today I called ICE and sent a letter to @DHSgov Secretary Nielsen to make sure Prince stays where he belongs—right here in Maryland. Please help spread the word—this fight is too important. https://t.co/JTuBnL6UDaMore news: My amendment on ZTE has been added to the NDAA, which passed in Committee last night. This bipartisan piece of legislation will ensure that Trump can’t let ZTE, a serial violator of US laws, off the hook. Now we need to pass this in full Senate! https://t.co/rse2aYeIs5Trumpcare in action: Higher premiums, millions left uninsured, and expansion of junk plans that will leave Americans susceptible to denied coverage. This is all happening while major corporate executives reap the windfall benefits of the GOP tax law. Stop the sabotage! https://t.co/0C3o6oKJlyAnd now we learn that Trump’s lawyer accepted a payment of at least $400,000 to fix talks with the Ukraine? This certainly is one area where Trump ranks #1—Swamp Life. https://t.co/BDDERRRL8fSummer is almost here, and families in Maryland are planning summer road trips to the Bay, Ocean City, and across the country. But now they’re seeing gas prices soar—while the #TrumpTaxScam is handing just 4 Big Oil companies a nearly $15 BILLION windfall over the next decade. https://t.co/YxIziUiEau…. And the evidence just keeps pouring in. This tax plan is mostly a boon to wealthy shareholders. What happened to the $4,000 pay raise that working families were promised? https://t.co/g4bH2ZVrNTAs I told Kelly on @CNBCClosingBell, we must stop the President from compromising our national security in order to help the ZTE, which has repeatedly violated our laws and lied about it. That why my amendment passed yesterday with a strong bipartisan vote of 23 to 2. https://t.co/NLxJFhrn5HGood news: My amendment to stop President Trump from unilaterally exempting ZTE from penalties for their repeated violations of our laws passed the Banking Committee on a bipartisan basis. Glad the Senate is putting America's national security first, not jobs in China.The Supreme Court sides with Goliath against David—taking away even the slingshots. They have stripped workers of their best defense against corporate wrongdoing—the right to band together to fight against discrimination, sexual harassment, and wage theft. https://t.co/9qOJ64ar1hWe must fight for greater transparency, real campaign finance reform, and stronger ethics rules—including passing the DISCLOSE Act. Proud to continue that fight in the Senate with @SenWhitehouse and fulfill that mission with #ABetterDeal for Our Democracy. https://t.co/7b6a2DzIArThis is horrible news. My heart goes out to the family of this brave Baltimore County Police Officer who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty and to her fellow officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect our community. https://t.co/pXutT8geVnWe cannot become so desensitized to school shootings that all we offer are platitudes. Congress needs to grow up and work together to implement common sense gun safety reform. NOW! https://t.co/SLThsIVAl3On the first anniversary of Mueller's appointment as Special Counsel—the integrity of our democracy is still being tested. Will McConnell allow a full Senate vote the bill to protect Mueller from being fired? RT if you agree that all patriots must stand up for the rule of law.The "King of Debt" Trump and GOP borrowed $2 trillion for their tax scam—and where's all the money going? To stock buybacks for wealthy CEOs and the foreign stockholders who own 35% of U.S. corporate stock. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be left to pick up the tab. https://t.co/Tkosgmr3waMy friend Catherine, a terrific senator, is spot on. The President’s remarks are despicable and should be universally condemned in the strongest possible terms. America is better than this—much better. https://t.co/b9u3DxEi5HYou did it—the phone calls, emails, and grassroots activism worked in the Senate! Now, we need the House to pass this resolution to save Net Neutrality. Keep the momentum going! https://t.co/9XjMp47sEGI voted YES on a motion to proceed on @SenMarkey’s resolution to save Net Neutrality. We have one more vote at 3PM, so keep the momentum up! This is a historic day, and we wouldn’t be here without your work to save the Internet.Pruitt violated the public trust, and he's mired in legal issues because of it. Yet, he continues to blame others for his wasteful spending—he just keeps digging himself further into a hole. Time for him to go. https://t.co/Ae7mNylwmITomorrow is a BIG day for the Internet. Take five minutes today to text your friends who are represented by a Republican senator. Ask them to call, tweet, or email them to demand that they save #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/gpZPXahZcoOur public servants at the CIA are patriots who work to protect our nation &amp; Gina Haspel has been committed to that mission.

This is not normal, and I will be demanding answers. https://t.co/sBNsqg2sBMMy mother taught my sisters and me to pursue our dreams. She was also a devoted public servant who gave back to the country she loved. Happy #MothersDay to all the Maryland Moms out there—including my wonderful partner in life, Katherine, who is the rock of our family. https://t.co/hBR7L0OZokI agree. That's why I introduced the SECURE Act to protect these families who have been here legally for decades. Glad to see Kelly now agrees—because he, Trump, and the GOP leadership have been opposed. Hope he will work to pass the SECURE Act ASAP. https://t.co/S5VRyFFHtfIn January, after starting to open the Atlantic Coast to oil drilling, Zinke said that he’d grant an exemption to Florida. It stank of fishy political motives to protect Rick Scott and Mar-a-Lago—which he denies. If it wasn’t a favor, why isn’t he exempting other coastlines? https://t.co/ZRc5vA2xpoMaryland fits the same criteria, Mr. Secretary. So why haven’t you tweeted out that Maryland is exempt from offshore drilling yet? https://t.co/3dpuaNdXuoMulvaney—who recently told bank lobbyists to buy more influence in Congress—just took a sledgehammer to the one unit in the federal government that is solely dedicated to protecting student loan borrowers from predatory lenders. Stench from the Trump Swamp gets worse by the day. https://t.co/GWZSwB33r8I am deeply saddened by the sudden death of County Executive Kevin Kamenetz.

Tell your friends: we need one more vote to save Net Neutrality. https://t.co/7t3qnID4whJoining @SenateDems to highlight the actions taken by Republicans to severely damage our health care system—meaning higher premiums for people across the country. If you’re concerned about your rising health care costs, I urge you to tune in: https://t.co/VO8Dcgv7c5Make no mistake: Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran deal was based on politics, not national security. Trump has isolated America from our allies, served the interest of Iranian hardliners, and destroyed America’s credibility.The GOP did not want to advertise that their tax giveaway to the very wealthy and big corporations contained a poison pill that would mean higher health insurance prices for average Americans—but now they can’t hide from the truth. https://t.co/Gml9TAfJSeThe cost of health care is a major concern for working families in Maryland and across the country. Today's requests for astronomical rate increases are a direct result of the actions taken by Trump and Congressional Republicans. Maryland families deserve better. https://t.co/G5ErDvl85cI urge my colleagues to pass the SECURE Act, which I’ve introduced with @SenatorCardin and @SenFeinstein, without delay to give these individuals, and our communities, the certainty and security we all deserve.These families work in our communities, have businesses in our state, and go to school with our children. Almost 2,000 Hondurans live in Maryland alone—and they have done so legally for decades. They call America home and I will fight this decision tooth and nail.This decision by Trump to turn on these individuals—who have been working and living in the U.S. legally for decades—is shameful. Sadly, it’s part of a Trump pattern of snuffing out the idea of America as a beacon of hope across the world. We must save Lady Liberty! https://t.co/5SbxZhQqvLOne year ago, the House voted to repeal the ACA. Trumpcare would have left 23M without coverage, raised premiums by 20%, and left our most vulnerable behind. While we won that fight, Trump has continued his sabotage campaign—meaning ↑ costs and ↓ security. We must fight back! https://t.co/Zqp8iQaHlHRemember after the Parkland tragedy when Trump sat in front of the TV cameras asking who is afraid of the NRA? Now that the cameras are gone, we have the answer—Donald Trump. He did their bidding and plans to take a bow before the NRA. This is an indecent act. Enough! https://t.co/HBPzSWZdDLArpaio is a serial civil rights violator &amp; has targeted the Hispanic community through outrageous &amp; illegal racial profiling for years. To call him a 'tireless champion' of the 'rule of law'—shows disrespect for the law. Given his criminal conviction, he should be behind bars. https://t.co/cufSYFcImITell your friends and neighbors that @SenateDems now have enough signatures to file a petition to force a vote to reinstate #NetNeutrality rules. We need ONE more vote to get to 51 and win. Keep the pressure up and tell all senators to stand with consumers and entrepreneurs. https://t.co/vdn529BY0vWe must reduce violent crime in Baltimore, and this federal partnership can help us. As noted here, last week Sessions told me he would reconsider the DOJ's earlier denial of assistance—and I will keep fighting to ensure Baltimore gets additional help for public safety. https://t.co/Ry1xnle2KfNever imagined myself saying this, but Tom Price is right. By repealing a central piece of the Affordable Care Act in their tax plan, Republicans are increasing health care costs for working people—all while giving billionaires tax cuts. Americans deserve the truth. https://t.co/UeqgrlRpFgI was the guest on Dan’s podcast this week, I hope you’ll take a listen. I provided an update on the Republican tax plan, immigration issues, Iran deal, and why Sessions cannot exclude Baltimore from a federal grant to reduce violent crime. https://t.co/4b7Eo90r7mAs I said at the @TaxMarch, don't be fooled by the bill of goods Trump &amp; the GOP are peddling about their tax plan. The amounts going to stock buybacks for corporate executives, foreign stockholder and the wealthy are roughly 40 times the bonuses and wage hikes going to workers. https://t.co/sQv06SPHbbThis is not the growth rate Trump promised with his tax plan. His own @CommerceGov gives us proof that this plan is not supercharging the economy. Billionaires and corporations who donate to Republican campaigns got windfall tax cuts—while the rest of us got $2 trillion in debt. https://t.co/Cq8A6SukFsPompeo has a reckless "shoot first, ask questions later" attitude and is likely to reinforce, not check, Trump's worst instincts. And how can he represent American values abroad when he has made divisive comments about minority groups here at home? I voted no on his nomination. https://t.co/nsPRKHEtNbThis is a positive first step. Now McConnell should reconsider and allow a vote in the full Senate.  This isn’t a question of political party, it’s about the integrity of our democracy. https://t.co/ljd80C0vX4Trump Swamp Monsters: the Director of the CONSUMER Protection Financial Bureau tells big banks that, as a Congressman, he only met with bank lobbyists who gave $$ to his campaign and they should buy more influence by contributing to members of Congress who will do their bidding. https://t.co/N5Iyqm2iZdTrump’s travel ban only weakens our security by playing into the hands of our enemies. I have repeatedly pushed for more transparency but the Administration refuses to give us clear answers, particularly on the waiver process—an issue the Justices raised today.I’ll be questioning Attorney General Jeff Sessions shortly. As you can imagine, I have many pressing questions for him. Tune in: https://t.co/f04OgkJvDMAre you serious? This isn’t a brunch recommendation, @MickMulvaneyOMB. This is about holding big banks accountable when working Americans file complaints about them. Reminder, the "C" in @CFPB stands for "Consumer" not "Corporations." https://t.co/els6vG6qvxPruitt should be fired. That's the one thing Trump’s supposed to be good at, right? https://t.co/rTLeXDbBrhStunning. CBO analysis shows that Republicans are selling a false bill of goods with their tax plan. Over the next decade, nearly 45% of the income from the increased economic activity from these tax cuts flows to foreigners, not Americans—and by 2028, that number jumps to 71%. https://t.co/XcLvyikP1SOur nation’s capital is one of the most expensive places to live in this country and without pay, many interns cannot afford to live here. The Senate and House need to pay their interns—it’s that simple. https://t.co/XR73Fu2uCIThe best way to celebrate #EarthDay: Call on Scott Pruitt to resign. https://t.co/RkpObT99TtMaile’s less than a few weeks old and she still has far better fashion sense than me. Might have to get some tips from her next time she's on the Senate floor. https://t.co/S8wFhp1tuWOur community was shaken and heartbroken when Great Mills High School experienced a shooting. But the determination of these students to end gun violence in our schools and our neighborhoods gives me renewed faith. We will keep fighting until we improve gun safety and save lives! https://t.co/rrFpk6uh6HPeople of color continue to face unfair and discriminatory treatment in the marketplace. As shown in the recent Starbucks incident, we must do more to combat racism and injustice. So why did the Senate pass a bill today that takes us in the opposite direction? https://t.co/FMmXVGYow2More proof that economic growth and combatting climate change go hand-in-hand. Protecting the environment is not just about the future of our planet—it’s also about creating jobs and supporting a healthy economy. Proud that Maryland is leading the fight! https://t.co/dU1lnkF3E8Pruitt’s conduct in office is a disgrace. He no longer holds the confidence of the American people, and his actions are examples of why many distrust the federal government. His gross misjudgment and poor leadership undermine the @EPA, and I believe he must resign.Making sure you saw this @realDonaldTrump, @SenateMajLdr, and @SpeakerRyan. While big banks have been cashing out to the tune of billions of dollars, you’re turning around and asking working families to foot the bill. Why aren’t you tweeting about that? https://t.co/wqxj5u1qaOA big salute to First Lady Barbara Bush for her commitment to public service and living a life of purpose. I had the honor of joining her in Maryland in support of the Foundation for Family Literacy, which she created. Condolences to the entire Bush family.This is exactly why the Senate must pass the bipartisan #BRINKAct without any more delay. China’s biggest banks still launder money for North Korea, despite UN sanctions. My bill with @SenToomey would sanction those banks and ratchet up the pressure on Kim Jong Un. https://t.co/6JpXvF5Si2The Koch Bros and special interest groups are spending over $100M trying to convince Americans that the #GOPTaxScam is the greatest thing since sliced bread. But I have news for them: the American people aren't buying it. We need to continue to counter the propaganda machine. https://t.co/UlKEVl6WutWith billionaires like the Koch Brothers spending millions of dollars to mislead and deceive the American people about the impact of the #GOPTaxScam, it’s up to us to set the record straight. Tune in as I join @taxmarch to do just that. #TaxDay https://t.co/temhTs85wKBuilding strong communities starts in our neighborhoods—with the people who live and work there. It was great to be in Park Heights with local leaders and thank you to @BoldNewHeights for showing me your community-first approach to redevelopment. Look forward to working together! https://t.co/xHP39Ql5V5I had the opportunity to visit @TowsonU and meet with @kimschatzel to talk about the opportunities and challenges facing the university, tour the campus, and have an open forum with students. It’s never a dull moment when you’re in a room full of Towson Tigers! https://t.co/BCn2TrBvtaDespite Republican claims to the contrary, their tax bill is just a boon to corporate executives and wealthy shareholders. Exhibit A is the huge surge in corporate stock buybacks that we’ve seen since the bill’s passage—and American workers are left footing the bill. https://t.co/xorh1PEu7vWith a President as reckless and unstable as Trump, we need a Secretary of State with a steady hand and a strategic mind. Pompeo is the opposite of what we need for this critical position.From his positions on the Iran deal, to refugees, to torture, to climate change, to equality for all—Pompeo has shown he is fundamentally averse to diplomacy and lacks the skills needed for our chief diplomat.I voted NO on Pompeo to head the CIA and I will vote NO on his nomination to be Secretary of State. He has a shoot first, ask questions later attitude on the use of force. He will reinforce, not check, Trump's worst instincts.Stunning. Buried in @USCBO’s report is the tax scam’s impact on Gross National Product—which is a better measure of actual income for Americans. In 2028, 80% of the income from the economic activity driven by the tax cuts flows to foreigners rather than families here at home. https://t.co/MOj1zuLUJMMick Mulvaney has been the number one ally of big banks at the CFPB—at the expense of American consumers. You bet that I’m going to hold him accountable at today’s Banking Committee Hearing. Tune in live: https://t.co/ISp74vMJtaTake a look at this. Last June, Rosenstein told me that Mueller could not be fired without good cause. When I asked whether Mueller could contest his firing in court for lack of cause, he told me that was a hypothetical question. Well, today it's not a vague hypothetical. https://t.co/B0eflX7aJyIn just a few minutes, I’ll be live with @CoryBooker and @SenatorBaldwin. We’ll be talking about an issue we think should be getting more attention: corporate stock buybacks, which have been skyrocketing as a result of the Republican tax plan. Tune in: https://t.co/tJp05wbftxHow long will Republican leadership stay silent and ignore the instability coming from the Oval Office? It is far past time for all patriots, regardless of political party, to stand up for our democracy. https://t.co/LPRwxS9gZmDespite Republican claims to the contrary, their tax bill is a huge giveaway to the wealthy and big corporations. Exhibit A is the surge in corporate stock buybacks that we’ve seen since the bill’s passage. Join @CoryBooker, @SenatorBaldwin, and I tonight at 5pm to learn more ↓ https://t.co/urvPfzjxXhGOP leaders must stop burying their heads in the sand. If this isn’t a clear sign that we should unite immediately to protect the rule of law and Special Counsel Mueller, I don’t know what is. https://t.co/MivoWbLBQS@SenCortezMasto Yet Congressional efforts to strengthen the laws against wage discrimination through the passage of bills like the #PaycheckFairnessAct have been blocked by Republicans.@SenCortezMasto Exactly, @SenCortezMasto. Women are still only paid 80 cents for every dollar paid to a man, a yearly pay difference of $10,086. And the disparity is even worse for many women of color. #EqualPayDay@SenCortezMasto It’s a national disgrace that the gender gap still exists in 2018. Equal pay isn’t just about fairness. It can mean the difference between being able to make ends meet, pay for childcare, or save for retirement.Congratulations, @TammyDuckworth! Abigail and little Maile are so lucky to have you as a Mom and mentor. Wishing you all the best. https://t.co/aDOuKL9OUfThe GOP tax scheme put $1.5 trillion on the nation's credit card—now the House GOP wants to balance the budget on the backs of working families, seniors, and kids. I’ll fight any effort to gut Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and investments in our nation’s economy. https://t.co/RKUSBDVcaoIt was great visiting Misty Meadow Farm Creamery, a Smithsburg staple that has been around since 1918. I met with current owner David Herbst, grandson of original owners and talked about we can best support our dairy farmers in the upcoming Farm Bill. Can't beat this ice cream! https://t.co/otFSl8lNvTI had the pleasure of joining Diane Rehm on her new podcast for an in-depth conversation on gun violence and the powerful difference that the student movement can make. Take a listen here: https://t.co/eYB65XYxnGI had the pleasure of joining Diane Rehm on her new podcast for an in-depth conversation on gun violence and the powerful difference that the student movement can make.

Go O’s! #TBT https://t.co/9dLWNa0sA7I’ll be answering questions on how to keep the pressure up on Congress after the #MarchforOurLives. Have a question? Tweet them at me ↓ https://t.co/LcPY6ouV8yThis is an important step in the effort to stop Trump from using the presidency to enrich himself and his family. The framers saw the government as an instrument for public good, not a vehicle for private enrichment. Thumbs up to @BrianFrosh and @AGKarlRacine on this victory. https://t.co/mkfWJvjCd3Families in Baltimore and across the country deal with gun violence every single day—a fact we can never forget. The fight for gun safety is not just about school shootings and mass shootings, but also about the daily toll of violence. We must do better. https://t.co/ya76XKbNzjAn important step, along with our allies, to stand up to Russian aggression. Will President Trump now be willing to acknowledge the threat the Kremlin poses to our elections and support the bipartisan DETER Act? https://t.co/XcecNCKxUpNow that the #MarchforOurLives is over, the gun lobby is counting on us to give up and go away. We must show them that we’re in this fight until we pass legislation to stop the bloodshed. Are you with me?I've been so moved by the enthusiasm and activism of Marylanders, and I am proud to represent citizens who are so engaged and thoughtful. When you make your voices heard, you can truly make a difference. This may be a long battle, but we’re in this together. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/aE1NBepcwUAs we march today, let us never forget the names or stories of the 481 Marylanders we’ve lost to gun violence in the last year alone. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/m2yyCYi0RLTo the students in Maryland and across the country who are marching today—I have a simple message for you: know your power. You are not only the future—you are the conscience of America and you can change the direction of our nation. #MarchforOurLivesOur students—in Maryland, Florida, and around the nation—are calling out those who hide behind the gun lobby and demanding action. We owe it to them to have a vote on the common-sense gun safety measures. To the GOP leadership: Inaction is complicity. #MarchforOurLives https://t.co/Y91Vdq2P24Trump appointed Bolton—a man with a history of warmongering—to the most critical national security job in the WH. He was a cheerleader for the 2003 war in Iraq, has supported bombing Iran, preemptively striking NK, and going to war with Cuba. America does not want another war.This is heartbreaking news. No parent should ever have to deal with the pain of losing a child like this. Rest in peace, Jaelynn—you were taken way too soon. https://t.co/JoW6wg8zDnJust last week, I stood in solidarity with students from Great Mills High School as we participated in the national walkout to protest gun violence—now they’re living the nightmare that they were trying to prevent. This has got to stop. There are no excuses. https://t.co/iSlQ4tvl3oJoined St. Mary's County Sheriff and School Superintendent to show solidarity with the Great Mills High School community and express gratitude to first responders. But while words can express our feelings, only action will reduce gun violence and save lives. Congress must act.Headed to St. Mary’s County to be with the students, teachers, &amp; families of Great Mills High School. Will also join Sheriff Cameron at a 1 pm briefing &amp; will provide updates when we know more. Much gratitude to all the first responders. We must stop the epidemic of gun violence. https://t.co/HYXvvWof2KWe are closely monitoring the reports of a shooting at Great Mills High School in St. Mary’s County. For those in the St. Mary's area, please follow instructions from local law enforcement. https://t.co/wMPuuWraGnLess than two days left, @astro_ricky —how exciting! Looking forward to hearing all about your mission when you come back from the @Space_Station. You make Maryland so proud. https://t.co/Z4CN448qs4Congrats to Marylander @ncgrove_16 and @TeamUSA on winning gold in the sled hockey final! #Paralympics https://t.co/1AtZBUXp6tWe need to make sure that every Member of Congress is more afraid about the next school massacre than of the NRA. And you know who’s going to make it happen? The students across the country who’ve been demanding change. https://t.co/7lyIDyPYzTIt was great speaking at the Army Alliance Luncheon at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The research, testing, and operations at Aberdeen are key to our national defense. @USAGAPG is also one of the largest employers in Maryland and generates $7B a year to our economy. https://t.co/cJgsTB5OOuYes, great game! Well played Wildcats. https://t.co/3inSaX68kXWell played @UMBCAthletics! Made history! So proud of you. #RetrieverNation https://t.co/yMQcLmunxKGetting warmed up for tonight’s game. @SenPatRoberts and @JerryMoran, are you ready? Retrievers getting ready to chow down on the Wildcats tonight!#MarchMadness https://t.co/mbYIK8sojuWe must protect the Mueller investigation—this isn’t a question of political party, it’s about the integrity of our democracy. GOP leaders must speak out and make clear that President Trump must respect the rule of law. Patriots cannot remain silent. https://t.co/ynLU87m4ymWhy is Trump silent while our allies in the fight against ISIS, the Syrian Kurds, are brutally forced out of Afrin, by Turkish forces. Silence is complicity &amp; sends the terrible message that the U.S. will not stand by our allies in the face of aggression. https://t.co/8skFcNYMQ1The firing of Andrew McCabe just 48 hours before his planned retirement is a gross abuse of power more in keeping with lawless authoritarian regimes than a great democracy that stands for the rule of law. This abuse of presidential power to crush an individual cannot stand. https://t.co/V9Cszc0bpaThe @umdwbb also had a huge win today. Congrats on their victory! Don’t mess with Maryland. https://t.co/NCSZkA54KrCheck my receipts → https://t.co/4e7oRqo82U https://t.co/t5zjCtBSJBI think you owe me a beer, @MarkWarner. cc: @ESPN #RetrieverNation https://t.co/5P7GBhY5w0This is the first time in history that a 16 seed has beat a 1 seed. And you know who did it? @UMBCAthletics BABY!!! https://t.co/Cuh0SstTIrEnjoyed meeting with @BillGates to discuss ways we can work together to improve America’s education system, make higher education more affordable, develop a universal flu vaccine and support critical global health initiatives. Appreciate all the good work of the @gatesfoundation. https://t.co/3lAb5jzn47The career officers at our @StateDept faithfully serve our country, irrespective of the party in power. The allegations that the Trump Administration is purging our civil servants, based on a political litmus test, are deeply disturbing—we must get to the bottom of this. https://t.co/eKogVmWh1BMark, after the Retrievers finish with the Wahoos, they will be known as the Boohoos—crying all the way back to the locker room. #RetrieverNation https://t.co/bMwKd3VdA4I will deeply miss my dear friend Louise Slaughter. She was passionate, tenacious, and quick-witted—with a heart for working people and an eye for phonies. Hers was a remarkable and uniquely American story. Her legacy is all around us from the fights she led. We love you, Louise! https://t.co/AvYtTizYcPBut today’s sanctions won’t be enough to deter Putin. We must do more to ensure Russia doesn’t attack our democratic process. There’s a clear, bipartisan solution in Congress: the DETER Act. It’s time we take action now and pass it.The latest sanctions against Russia stress the importance of the Mueller investigation—many of those sanctioned were named in Mueller’s recent indictment. The Trump Organization must comply with this subpoena as we work to get to bottom of Russian interference in our elections. https://t.co/sXchXPDh2hI’ll admit, filling out this year’s #MarchMadness bracket was tough. But I’m going @UMBC all the way! I find it’s always better to choose heart over head. Let’s see how my picks do this year. Fingers crossed. https://t.co/nimClnXfrjIn a few minutes, I’ll be joining Maryland students who are demanding congressional action to save lives by enacting common-sense gun safety measures to stop the carnage from mass shootings and the daily toll of gun violence. Tune in ↓ #EnoughIsEnoughDMV https://t.co/Ls4vkRmFt8I stand with you all and hopefully I’ll see some of you at the Capitol shortly! We need your energy to get Congress to take action to end the bloodshed now. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/nah7DR9S5oIf this scene is heartbreaking to you, use that pain not to despair but to fight back against the gun lobby. Do not give up, we must push Congress to do the right thing. We owe it to those we’ve lost to never give up. #NotOneMore https://t.co/93NrQYLnfjI tried to quiz a few Maryland Cub Scouts on the history of the Senate and let me tell you, they’re quite the history buffs! Always a good time hanging out with some fellow—albeit a bit younger—outdoor enthusiasts. Thanks for visiting! https://t.co/1cv5CjwSKRRepublicans ran up the debt when they were ramming through a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway for wealthy special interests. But don’t be surprised when the GOP says their high deficits now require big cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, that's what their proposed budget does. https://t.co/8YoFhpMknzFiring your Secretary of State over Twitter.... what a dysfunctional way to run a country, @realDonaldTrump. Modeling your governing style off of The Apprentice is no way to govern. https://t.co/OQVp4FpYgURemember when Trump boasted that he's "not scared of the NRA”? Well, that was short lived. Like everything else, it was all for the cameras. When the cameras left, he scurried back into their arms. https://t.co/y1xo0a50P5Exactly. When we have a Commander-in-Chief who puts his own financial interests ahead of the country’s wellbeing and defrauds students at "Trump University," this is what happens. If another country had put DeVos in charge of our schools we would consider it an act of war. https://t.co/i876zXd7vnSince day one, I've said that DeVos lacks basic knowledge about some of the most important issues in the education community. After these comments, it’s even more apparent that DeVos shouldn't be in her current job. Her grade: F. https://t.co/TdBXfjOt0zFor the past 30 years, @MarysCenter has provided health care services to some of our most vulnerable residents. Thank you for all the great work you’re doing! This is a good example of why we fought so hard to fund Community Health Centers. https://t.co/i5RXnjAaXNRemember, North Korean leaders have long wanted a face-to-face meeting with an American president to elevate themselves as co-equals on the world stage. The meeting holds some opportunity, but also potential peril. This is not The Apprentice. https://t.co/9hTrJ2C3p4This #InternationalWomensDay, I wanted to celebrate a mentor, a fierce advocate for Marylanders, and the longest-serving woman in the history of the Congress: Barbara Mikulski. Thanks for being a fearless trailblazer for both Maryland and our entire country! https://t.co/f3tTfOTmZSWe cannot allow the cries of experts, survivors, and students to be drowned out by the gun lobby. In just a few minutes, I’ll be hearing testimonies from survivors and experts who want Congress to take action to strengthen our nation’s gun laws. Tune in → https://t.co/p7piE2xxRl https://t.co/UoKUKKKkRnInfrastructure investments such as these are crucial to moving our country forward, and I will continue to fight for full funding for critical programs like the TIGER grants.Creating good-paying jobs in Maryland is our number one priority, and this significant federal investment in Sparrows Point will allow us to do just that. This will expand job opportunities close to the Port of Baltimore and help grow our economy. https://t.co/IhEFJaqwetI’ll be asking DoD officials about this Trump tweet at today’s budget hearing. If he thinks this spending was so “stupid” why does his defense strategy spend far more on overseas conflicts ($447B) than his infrastructure plan for OUR country ($200B)? Makes no sense! https://t.co/gbCudyFZPwGood meeting w/@AndersFoghR to talk about the DETER Act—which would impose immediate, tough, and automatic sanctions on Russia if it interferes with our elections again, and calls for a strategy to work with our European allies to deter Russia’s aggression.https://t.co/E2zGrsXPNcThis must be a wake-up call to the puppets of the NRA. Teenagers shouldn't have to beg their gov't to do what's right. Tomorrow @davidhogg111 who survived the massacre in Parkland, as well as a Baltimore teacher will testify at a forum on gun violence. Hope senators will tune in. https://t.co/v5FtulRPkBI’ve teamed up with @RoyBlunt and 42 other senators to urge the President in support of @United2026. Through a joint #FIFAWorldCup bid, we have the opportunity to promote and celebrate the positive impact soccer has had for millions of Americans. https://t.co/NZ3qJKomSaDemocrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have negotiated in good faith to protect Dreamers, but you’ve torpedoed those efforts. Show real leadership or get out of the way. Policy making isn’t conducted through unhinged tweeting. https://t.co/QbEeEDNYDGWatch this, @realDonaldTrump. Whether it’s deportation tactics that target scholarship recipients instead of gang members or the Dreamers who start to lose their protections today, your policies aren’t making our country safer—they are tearing apart families. https://t.co/q0XnPVHbLiTrump said he wanted to treat Dreamers with “heart"—but he has sabotaged every bipartisan agreement that has been put on the table and walked away from every potential compromise to #ProtectDreamers. Don the Con strikes again.Failure to help Dreamers falls on Trump alone:
Sept: He sets March 5 as the day he’ll rescind protections for Dreamers 
Jan: He refuses to back any bipartisan solutions
Feb: He says he’s going to treat Dreamers with “heart”
March: Dreamers are in peril &amp; he still refuses to act https://t.co/PgglQU9iHmThanks to everyone who joined @BrianFrosh and me at our recent Consumer Protection Forum—where we discussed how to protect yourself from scams and our efforts to stop the Trump Admin from dismantling consumer protections. Stay tuned: we'll be doing similar events in coming weeks. https://t.co/JWvCFFUffH↓ Watch, share, and send to anyone you know who thinks the Republican tax plan is meant to help them, when the biggest windfalls are really going to big corporations, foreign stockholders, and billionaires—and the middle class will pay the bill. https://t.co/9p7haUqh1NSad but not surprising that within 24 hours Trump was back to having the NRA speak for him and the NRA was happy to oblige. Same thing with Dreamers: one day he wanted a bipartisan "bill of love" and 48 hours later he was back to deportation mode. Don't be fooled by Don the Con. https://t.co/SrNtcC08XvPleased to report something that has been in short supply these days: good news! Because Marylanders spoke out and we kept fighting, Pruitt has reversed his misguided decision to revoke funding from the Bay Journal. Look forward to its continued good work for years to come. https://t.co/Mb3kmb1em5In a few minutes, I’m going live on Facebook with @BrianFrosh. We’re hosting the first in a series of Consumer Protection Forums and are committed to helping you protect your families from unfair, deceptive, predatory, and fraudulent conduct. Tune in → https://t.co/p7piE2xxRl https://t.co/5HV8rVy1ZFFrom day one, Trump has exploited the Oval Office for his family’s own financial gain. First, he rammed through a tax plan that gives a windfall to Trump’s businesses. Now Kushner is getting special loans after giving WH access? President's motto: Wall Street billionaires &gt; you. https://t.co/wl44eUL1WVEquifax was the biggest data breach in U.S. history and yet the CFPB has reportedly rebuffed offers from the Federal Reserve to support an investigation. This is unacceptable and Fed Chair Powell told me he would give me a status report. Will report back. https://t.co/9hqTQoAad1Over 700 people have signed up for the Consumer Protection Forum I am hosting tonight with @BrianFrosh—and many are worried about the Equifax data breach. The CFPB refuses to take this problem seriously, so I asked Fed Chair Powell to look into the issue today. https://t.co/sAr7AkEFPCCongratulations to my good friend, Freeman Hrabowski! Under your leadership, @UMBC has become a national example of how higher education institutions can bring together students from all different backgrounds—both nationally and internationally—to make sure that they all excel. https://t.co/OffU24WHIYThe Trump Hotel is across the street from the current FBI HQ. Trump will benefit financially from this new plan to keep the FBI where it is and not redevelop it into commercial space. Yet GSA and FBI refused to answer when asked if he was involved in this decision. Why? https://t.co/G6RZQagCdYI’m not going to let up on the Trump Administration for abandoning the decade-long effort to fully consolidate the FBI headquarters at a more secure location. Their new plan is a 180-degree reversal from what the FBI and GSA have recommended previously will cost taxpayers more. https://t.co/orON28gnsmGood news is that there’s a bipartisan bill to protect our future elections: The DETER Act. Let’s pass it. https://t.co/rDnd65YGLoThe hits keep coming. Our Cyber Command Chief says he hasn't been directed to confront Russia’s cyberattacks on our elections &amp; that Putin hasn’t paid a price that will deter future attacks. No wonder the CIA, DNI, &amp; State Dept. agree that Russia will interfere in our midterms. https://t.co/rFQTb7uusBWhat happened @realDonaldTrump? I thought the ‘forgotten men and women’ were supposed to get MASSIVE tax cuts? This just looks like your billionaire buddies are continuing to reap the rewards of your tax scam.
https://t.co/MGwo66Iwb5The internet doesn’t belong to @AjitPaiFCC and @realDonaldTrump, it belongs to the American people. If you agree, take action TODAY and fight to save #NetNeutrality. #OneMoreVote https://t.co/NZClGh2HwCGetting rid of #NetNeutrality will stifle competition and put entrenched corporate interests ahead of innovators, small businesses, and American consumers. We must fight back ↓ https://t.co/ZlBUye6DzhWe need an Internet that’s open to all, not just the highest bidder. The good news? We need just one Republican senator to vote to save #NetNeutrality. Talk to your friends, tell them to call their Republican Members of Congress! #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/nnzyywsvhdMaybe if they didn’t rush through such a horrible tax plan, there wouldn’t be so many glitches? Why did Republicans think a rushed overhaul of our entire tax system—done in secret with high-priced lobbyists—was a recipe for success? Working Americans will suffer the consequences. https://t.co/1B3iTEOOKuThanks to you and the entire @NASAGoddard team for the work you are doing to advance our knowledge, improve our lives, and protect our planet! https://t.co/RReWGqNYu8Trump didn't say whether he will update his budget so it doesn’t slash funding for background checks. I want teachers' focused on teaching not shooting. Time for Trump to stop flacking for the gun industry and work on bipartisan basis to stop the carnage. Less talk, more action. https://t.co/umfVGh8IgmBig congrats to the U.S. Women’s Hockey Team on their gold medal win last night—especially proud of Maryland’s own @skrooops28! #GoTeamUSA https://t.co/WJPnGmIbJDProud to see Maryland students marching to Capitol to demand action in solidarity with Florida students. Congress must act to end the carnage from gun violence. Inaction is complicity. https://t.co/9ruCJgHl0vWe are seeing high schoolers—who just witnessed one of the worst mass shootings in history—unite our country around gun violence prevention. It’s a national disgrace that so many in Congress are captive to the gun industry and block common sense steps to reduce the bloodshed. https://t.co/kJcxEkzEgmThis is a no-brainer. It can't end here. We still have much work ahead of us and will have to reverse Trump’s budget cuts to the gun background check system. https://t.co/TkYxzMOG4nWe must prevent the resurgence of discriminatory and predatory lending practices in Baltimore and elsewhere in the country. That's why we must stop Trump and Mulvaney from gutting efforts to stop those abuses. I hope you’ll join me in this fight. https://t.co/N2ZbT1O1GYOn this President's Day, we should all be concerned that the current president refuses to defend our democracy from foreign interference. He attacks our FBI while praising Putin. Congress needs to take immediate action before the 2018 elections to pass the bipartisan DETER Act. https://t.co/PZdd25pwWABeing the Commander-in-Chief means spending less time harassing people on Twitter and more time taking responsibly for your actions. We're in this mess because you set March 5th as the Dreamer deportation date and then threatened to veto a bipartisan solution. https://t.co/6f0xcPYRENRobert Mueller is doing his job. The Russians interfered in our 2016 elections and our intel chiefs say it will happen again. Now it’s time for Congress to act. There’s a clear solution to prevent Putin from interfering in our elections again: The DETER Act. https://t.co/JcNjpFIwI6It was an honor to celebrate Maryland’s own Frederick Douglass in the U.S. Capitol, be sworn in as a member of the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission, and introduce a @kmorrisjr—a direct descendant of Douglass and a friend. #FrederickDouglass200 #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/eFuV30ZknHOnly one person to blame for the mess we’re in: Trump. He terminated the DACA program and—despite his promise to support a bipartisan fix that included his full request for border security—he opposed it. What a fraud: he never cared about the Dreamers and wants to deport them.We should be making it easier for people with disabilities to lead independent lives, not harder. #HR620 will turn back the clock for some of our most vulnerable populations, and every House member who voted for this should be ashamed. I will fight this in the Senate. https://t.co/JOv5TXNltLOver and over again, I hear the survivors of gun violence tell Congress to take action. But like clockwork, the GOP leadership blocks common-sense measures proven to save lives. Who do you work for, the American people or the NRA? Inaction is complicity. https://t.co/OefJfCBGmDWe must do everything in our power to stop this horror. How many more shootings will it take for Congress to stop talking and take action? Lack of action is complicity. https://t.co/I4FB77MT9IThe numbers don’t lie: Trump is just putting his name on the strong economy he inherited from the Obama Administration. https://t.co/o9GEICWRhqWhy is Mick Mulvaney, as the head of the @CFPB, standing up for scammers instead of American consumers? https://t.co/JcYkGJYSNCIt was great speaking to the students from Harriet Tubman Middle School over at the @LibraryCongress about the life and achievements of a compassionate and courageous Marylander, and a great American—Harriet Tubman. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/hGPNeuQz9rCoats
Pompeo
Tillerson

… All have recently warned that Russia will interfere in our elections again. So why aren’t we doing anything? Congress has a solution to address this, let's pass the bipartisan DETER Act. https://t.co/O1LbeeZIkEI’m sure his spokesman probably didn’t think being on the side of predatory payday lenders was a good look? Either way, Mulvaney just revealed which side he’s on. https://t.co/Kdu2gYLMrVDemolition and rebuilding at the current site will also disrupt operations and send 20% of the workforce to locations across the country. It is a complete reversal from what the GSA and FBI have recommended previously, and Congress should reject this irresponsible proposal.It's outrageous that the Trump Administration would abandon a decade of effort toward the full consolidation of the FBI headquarters. Instead, they have put forward a hastily-written plan that will take more time and will likely cost taxpayers more money. https://t.co/Mek6jBqtSqHidden in Trump’s budget: An entirely immoral cut to food and nutrition programs for needy Americans. After giving millionaires and corporations big tax cuts, Trump now wants to take away $200B worth of food from low-income Americans. https://t.co/zPByWv5hJHThe other shoe drops: After borrowing $1.5 trillion to finance a tax cut for big corporations and millionaires, the Trump budget pays for it by cutting Medicare, Medicaid, and parts of Social Security. It doesn't forget the "forgotten Americans"—it makes their lives harder.To be clear, this Trump budget is not about deficit reduction. Even after cooking to books, they still can’t even balance the budget. This is just a plan to stack the deck even more for the wealthy and powerful and against working families.It’s a disaster for America’s leadership in the world, gutting the State Department while ramping up spending for nukes and the border wall.It’s a disaster for our environment. It drastically limits the EPA’s ability to safeguard our environment and the Chesapeake Bay.It’s a disaster for federal workers. It would cut federal retirement benefits by more than $150B over 10 years.It’s a disaster for students. It would make it even harder for Americans to pay back their student loans, and eliminates programs to recruit and train top-notch teachers in public schools.It’s a disaster for families struggling to make ends meet.  It would cut Social Security Disability Insurance—breaking Trump’s promise not to cut Social Security—and gut programs that help provide a basic standard of living for working families.It’s a disaster for our health care system. It would repeal the ACA using the same tired Graham-Cassidy bill we defeated and leave 21M+ uninsured, on top of the 13M who would no longer have coverage due to the tax bill. It also takes a sledgehammer to Medicaid and Medicare.Here’s my initial take on the President’s budget plan. I’ve worked on a number of budgets over the years, and I’ve never seen a budget so willing to squeeze working families in order to pay for a massive tax giveaway to the very wealthy and big corporations.Mr. President, your own FBI and DOJ said the Republican memo was misleading, yet you still released it. If transparency was your motive, why are you preventing the release of real facts? Your efforts to derail the Mueller investigation won’t stop us from getting the truth. https://t.co/dDSqIKf1kaBest of luck to @TeamUSA and all of the athletes representing Maryland at the 2018 Winter Olympics! We’ll be rooting for you. #PyeongChang2018 
https://t.co/BzUxLgyOhvGlad to have the opportunity to visit Hagerstown Regional Airport and Sierra Nevada Hangar up in Western Maryland—combined they help support 1,600 jobs in Maryland. https://t.co/5Sn8KXPMKrI’m proud to introduce this critical piece of legislation in the Senate. Historically Black Land-Grant Universities like @UMESNews are critical centers for higher education in our country and deserve the same financial flexibility as their peers. https://t.co/idEQkN4jdZThis week, as we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, I introduced legislation with @SenDavidPerdue, @SenThomTillis, and @SenSherrodBrown to provide 1890s Land-Grant Universities with the same financial flexibility currently enjoyed by their peers. https://t.co/7apQvJvgcRWe have finally reached a bipartisan budget agreement, which is a win for families in Maryland and across the country. And the fight to protect our Dreamers continues in earnest. Here are some of the things we fought for and Marylanders won: https://t.co/n82almq4U4If there was any doubt about who was rooting for a government shutdown, Trump let us know. The country would be better off if he would take an extended trip to Mar-a-Lago and let Congress work out a bipartisan agreement. https://t.co/jQ6Gl1g3LREquifax was the biggest data breach in U.S. history, and now the CFPB—under Trump’s management—puts the brakes on this investigation? That’s totally unacceptable. We cannot let the Trump Administration abdicate their responsibility to protect American consumers. https://t.co/QsfMzXnJ8ZWhile Trump wants to take credit for every uptick in the stock market and one-time bonuses from some corporations, he refuses to acknowledge their sizeable layoffs and Wall Street paydays. Here’s yet another example: https://t.co/mvlmZYbdFVDistorting intelligence information for political purposes is a gross abuse of power. Despite strong objections from his own Justice Department &amp; FBI, Trump has compromised our national security—to protect himself. This is a clear attempt to derail Mueller's search for the truth. https://t.co/3qOpUn1ngEThe job of the EPA is to protect our environment and the health of all Americans—but instead we see a raft of political decisions that undermine its integrity, including the politically motivated termination of the Chesapeake Bay Journal Cooperative Agreement. https://t.co/Mw2DCuNNRmThis is a breach of trust by the Speaker of the House. Paul Ryan has a constitutional obligation to the American people. He must protect the integrity of the House Intelligence Committee and congressional oversight of the executive branch. #NunesMemo https://t.co/64pFIss8kZWhy are Republicans going to such lengths to try to undermine the Mueller investigation into Trump? #NunesMemo https://t.co/aoRijRVFBnI recognize that this bill will not pass in the current GOP-controlled Congress but we still must organize for meaningful action on climate change. The public is way ahead of the Congress on this issue. Time to change that.It’s a win-win-win—boosting middle-class pocketbooks, growing good-paying jobs, and reducing carbon pollution.This week I introduced the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act with @RepDonBeyer. This ‘cap and dividend’ approach is a simple, fair, and effective plan to address the dangers of climate change. https://t.co/dlHjgCMAt6To sum up #SOTU: I liked "My fellow Americans." It was pretty much all downhill after that.Should he decide to pursue an agenda that puts working families first—on economic issues, on infrastructure investments, on protecting our #Dreamers—@SenateDems stand ready to work with him. But if he refuses to change his ways, we will fight him tooth and nail. #SOTUAt every turn, Trump has broken promises to the middle class and made life harder for people in Maryland and across the country. #SOTUThe Administration’s unrelenting efforts to tear immigrant families apart and waste taxpayers’ money on an ineffective wall has put thousands of families in crisis. And in both word and deed, Trump has diminished our stature around the world and undermined our national security.While Trump wants to take credit for every uptick in the stock market and one-time bonuses from major corporations, he refuses to acknowledge their sizeable layoffs and Wall Street paydays. #SOTUHe is quick to invoke the ‘forgotten’ men and women when it’s useful in a speech, but he didn’t give them a second thought when he passed enormous tax breaks for millionaires and corporations—and asked millions of American children, workers, and seniors to foot the bill. #SOTUInstead of starting his presidency with a single bipartisan proposal, Trump made an all-out assault on Americans’ health care. #SOTUThe American people deserve a leader who spends less time patting his own back and more time having their backs. Unfortunately, what we’ve seen from Trump has been anything but real leadership. #SOTUJust got back from #SOTU. Here are my thoughts: President Trump was eager to take credit for things he had nothing to do with and ignore the harm he has imposed on the country over the last year.#AYearofTrump could have focused on real tax reform that helped the middle class. But he was hell-bent on giving unprecedented tax cuts to big corporations and the very wealthy—and is forcing working Americans to pay the price. #SOTUBefore I head out to watch the President give his State of the Union Address, I wanted to reflect on Trump’s first year in office—it’s one that has brought with it one of the most significant tests of our democracy in our lifetime. #YearofTrump #SOTU https://t.co/f4lgQMcaAgAs Pompeo said yesterday, Russia will interfere again in 2018 midterm elections. The United States cannot turn a blind eye. The bipartisan DETER Act sends a powerful message to Russia or any hostile actor: if you attack American elections, you will face severe consequences.Trump has refused to hold Russia accountable for interfering in our elections. Instead, he has repeatedly denied our intel community’s findings and praised Putin. Now he is ignoring the sanctions law Congress passed by a vote of 517-5. This cannot stand. https://t.co/S7JRwdO7JPPruitt likes to say that the EPA needs “to work together with the states.” Meanwhile, the Trump Administration proposed zeroing out funding for critical state programs, like those that help keep the Chesapeake Bay healthy. #StateofPollution https://t.co/XDaQ6wr8ICThis morning I had the honor of meeting Fred and Cindy Warmbier. Their son Otto was imprisoned by the North Koreans, released in a coma, and died six days after his return to the United States. Congress must honor their son’s memory and pass the Otto Warmbier #BRINKAct.Mnuchin told the American people there would be “no absolute tax cut for the upper class” and Trump said "everybody" in the middle class would get a tax cut. So why are 376,000 Maryland families now paying higher taxes while millionaires get an average yearly tax cut of $64,000? https://t.co/PvpP3PPUt5Tonight Senate Republicans will force a vote on a bill to deny women their right to make their own reproductive health decisions. I will vote NO. Women—not politicians, not their bosses, or anyone else—should make these decisions as already upheld by the courts.Trump's betrayal of the "forgotten Americans" was on full display in Davos where global financial elites gushed over his corporate tax cuts and he got a "good reception from billionaire investors." No surprise as they all got even richer while Americans are left to pay the bill.It's been an honor to work with @CecileRichards in the battle for freedom, women's rights and equality. Her courage, dedication, leadership, and hard work are unmatched. Sad to see you go, but glad to know you’ll still be engaged in the good fight! https://t.co/8cpvqcLwWSIt's great that @RosLehtinen and @RepSchneider have introduced the House companion of the bipartisan #DETERAct. There is nothing more important to our democracy than making sure we protect the integrity of the electoral process. https://t.co/S78CZEuePVWe’re just learning that the President attempted a second Saturday Night Massacre. Trump’s contempt for our democracy and the rule of law knows no bottom. What is he afraid of? We must protect the Mueller investigation—the American people deserve the truth. https://t.co/1YlkDfRY0TThis Administration's move to side with predatory payday lenders reveals their true intentions for the @CFPB. We cannot let the Trump Administration gut an agency that has looked out for working people since day one—this news deserves more attention.
https://t.co/XUp1s4jWcnThere have been 11 school shootings this year. It’s only January 25th. If that makes you angry and you agree that inaction is complicity, call Republican Members of Congress and insist they say NO to the NRA and YES to common sense gun safety bills. https://t.co/kwNkvPVEitFor everyone who thinks the #GOPTaxScam will help working Americans, they should read this. Does using a tax windfall to lay off over 5K employees sound like putting America first? https://t.co/psUygnnzjrLarry Nassar’s actions are disgusting, reprehensible, and unforgivable. It should never have taken this long for justice to be served. We owe it to the over 160 brave women who spoke out to make sure this never happens again. https://t.co/ZnUMoSoJrrThanks for the support, @JoeBiden. The DETER Act sends an unequivocal message to Russia and any other foreign actor who may follow its example: if you attack our democracy, the consequences will be severe. https://t.co/RA8rKJQibmTrump said he was for America First, but it turns out he is for Wall Street firms first and American workers last. Thanks to his action, 20,000 American workers who install solar panels will lose their jobs as consumers are forced to pay more for solar energy. https://t.co/iKV3AwciBTCongratulations to my friend @SenDuckworth – very excited for you and your family! https://t.co/GRHjgywnVaWe must now pass the Dreamers bill in Senate and bring full weight of public to pass in House. https://t.co/vJMAEY2YdHWe now have a commitment from the GOP to provide funding for key priorities like community health centers, fighting the opioid epidemic, and – something they have refused to do before – a promise to vote on a bipartisan bill to protect Dreamers.GOP says they want to end the shutdown and negotiate in good faith. Then why did they just object to a motion by @timkaine to keep the government open through Tuesday while we work to resolve key issues?Federal employees didn't cause this shutdown and they shouldn't be punished for it. As we work to end the shutdown, @SenatorCardin and I supported a motion to ensure that these employees would be paid in full after the shutdown. Shameful that McConnell objected to the motion. https://t.co/sqW561LqnAOn the one year anniversary of President Trump’s inauguration, his incompetence has resulted in a government shutdown and he doesn’t even seem to care. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/OMlnTeHGMHWorking hard to reopen the government. Pleased to support @SenatorCardin in offering a motion to ensure that fed employees get paid in full after the shutdown. They didn’t create this mess and shouldn’t be punished. Shameful that @SenateMajLdr just objected to this effort!We urgently need to come together as one Congress and find an immediate solution. I’m headed to the Democratic Caucus meeting to talk about keeping our government funded. I’ll provide an update on next steps as soon as I’m back.Last night @SenateDems were all willing to pass a short-term CR (1-3) days with no additional demands or conditions—just to keep the United States government and the negotiations open. We tried to do that with a Unanimous Consent Request, and it was blocked by @SenateMajLdr.President Trump once said we need a "good government shutdown." I have news for Trump: there are no good government shutdowns.More inaction is a disservice to all Americans—including hardworking federal employees in Maryland. McConnell needs to work on a bipartisan basis to fund the government—instead of waiting for Trump to tweet out his next set of marching orders.It’s doubly outrageous that Senate Republicans wouldn’t even vote to keep the government open for three more days to resolve these issues in a bipartisan manner. We have to stay here until we get this done!After months of kicking the can down the road, I am extremely disappointed that President Trump and the Republicans have chosen to shut down the government rather than negotiating in good faith to reach a bipartisan agreement to address the priorities of the American people.I am confident we have the votes in Senate for a bipartisan budget agreement but @SenateMajLdr wants to first "figure out" what @realDonaldTrump wants. Why are we outsourcing our constitutional duties to a dysfunctional White House and "uninformed" president?This weekend marks the anniversary of President Trump’s first year in office— a year that has brought with it one of the most significant tests of our democracy in our lifetime. I gave the Democratic Weekly Address to talk about how we move forward as a country. https://t.co/XF0aBMVfl3We are on the verge of a government shutdown. I’m headed to the Senate floor to talk about why Congress must stop the dysfunction and work together to better serve the American people. The clock is ticking. Tune in: https://t.co/p7piE2xxRl. https://t.co/iUSn3WKvZNI spoke to @NPRinskeep this morning about the President’s lack of leadership as we face a potential government shutdown. Listen here:
https://t.co/acLgT9guB3We could avoid a government shutdown by sitting down and coming to an agreement that would get the support of a majority of both sides. That's what we should have been working on last year, instead of rushing through the Trump-Republican tax scam.Once again the BIG winners in Trump world: billionaires, foreign stockholders, hedge fund managers, and banks.
Losers: In one way or another, everyone else. 

Yes. This is a pattern.
https://t.co/4QHryhk735ICYMI: @WhipHoyer, @RepAnthonyBrown, and I held an event in Prince George’s County to discuss the harmful impact the #GOPTaxScam will have on Marylanders. Maryland must take action to protect itself. https://t.co/CYbU7pVkJNThe United States must do everything possible to prevent these attacks in the future by establishing harsh consequences for meddling in our elections. Today, @MarcoRubio are introducing the bipartisan DETER Act to do just that. https://t.co/NVQYgqPTJJWhile the 2016 election may have left our country divided on many issues, it exposed one critical problem that should unite all Americans: our democratic process is vulnerable to attacks by hostile foreign powers.
