History will not treat kindly the crass cruelty of this so-called Christmas "gift" to hard-working Americans. #GOPTaxScam6 months ago, Republicans enacted the Ryan/McConnell tax scam. I said at the time on the floor of the House that the bill should be named, "the Republican Donor-Class Relief Act." Because that's what it is. #GOPTaxScamTaking innocent children from the arms of their parents at the border is wrong. I'm proud to join @RepJerryNadler, @HouseJudDems &amp; more than 190 @HouseDemocrats to support the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act.OTD June 19, in 1865, enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas became the last individuals to receive news of their emancipation.

Congress needs to pass common sense gun violence prevention legislation, including my bill, the Background Check Completion Act, to close the #Charleston Loophole. #GUNviolence #EnoughIsEnough #GunReformNowProud of my colleagues for stopping the #GOPFarmBill, which just failed in the House 198 to 213.
