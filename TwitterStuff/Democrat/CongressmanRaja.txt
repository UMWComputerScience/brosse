Marches around the country are happening in order to #KeepFamiliesTogether. There are kids that need their families and I stand with everyone who is marching.It is almost July and children have still yet to be reunited with their families.  The cruelty continues from this policy and something MUST be done. #KeepFamiliesTogetherI guess you never know the side missions you can help journalists achieve until you try to investigate an EPA Administrator who's launching hit pieces on his own staff. https://t.co/0QZzj1R5fSBecause it's a direct quote and a technical term in this case, I'll consider it, but don't tell @marcorubio https://t.co/NN6xuECIkWHere's their piece with the more colorful term for those Nixonesque tricks and attempts at launching oppo attacks with public resources https://t.co/gFYGEngFgw ‚Ä¶.@lachlan and @swin24 of the @thedailybeast revealed EPA Chief Scott Pruitt's personal involvement in concerted efforts using EPA staff to undermine the reputations of his aides for perceived disloyalty. I wrote to Oversight Chair Gowdy to urge an investigation of these abuses. https://t.co/ybeBGLPtUII struggle to think of any explanation for this that shouldn't scare the hell out of all of us. For reference: https://t.co/0pT6TDiGRy https://t.co/TADNVM2UrFAnd they did. https://t.co/GrdVOK4ejHPhil Davis is the crime reporter for the Capital Gazette and he hasn't stopped doing his job, even as his colleagues have been shot and killed. When people attack the press and the work of journalism, please think of Phil and his colleagues around the world keeping us informed. https://t.co/XCdd5mjpj4Our country and our democracy are only able to thrive when our free press thrives, and that's only possible through the ceaseless commitment of journalists, even when they are under attack. https://t.co/gUz3x8pMlsPlease keep all those touched by this shooting in your thoughts and prayers.
https://t.co/du9wyW9FSmI was in the room for some of the most heated moments and can confirm that‚Äôs exactly what the transcript will show. https://t.co/Dt3MbQ1ssD12/10 agree https://t.co/9JpcRHdeMdI'm disappointed by the Supreme Court's Janus decision today. So long as unions provide services to all public employees, regardless of whether they are members or not, all employees should have to pay their fair share of administrative costs to receive bargained-for benefits. https://t.co/Lyx6blf3KGWe had a packed house yesterday at our bipartisan Middle Class Jobs Caucus briefing on how to improve worker training in the US. A special thanks to @RepGallagher, @MuSigmaInc, @AspenFutureWork, and @USChamber https://t.co/Hy26S7Zx95I am still committed in fighting to reverse the @FCC‚Äôs repeal of #NetNeutrality. I have signed a petition to force a vote in the House and will continue to do whatever I can to #SaveTheInternetSmall businesses in my district rely on an open internet when it comes to starting their business.  A repeal of #NetNeutrality will hurt them and is detrimental to the success of our country.  #SaveTheInternet#NetNeutrality ensures a level playing field online and makes sure everyone has access to a free and open internetMy House colleagues and I who introduced the #PerkinsCTE bill in the House are glad to see the Senate HELP Committee is marking it up this afternoon. https://t.co/ChKN6e38coA government that is by, of, and for the people is only possible when all eligible citizens have access to the voting booth. That is why I joined my colleagues on the Voting Rights Advancement Act and why I'm determined to minimize the effect of the Shelby County v. Holder case.#RestoretheVOTE and protect what keeps our democracy alive https://t.co/onigYPpyC05 years after the Supreme Court decided the Shelby County v. Holder case, many states have enacted laws that threaten access to the ballot and the right to vote. It‚Äôs time to #RestoreTheVOTEOn the 5th anniversary of the Shelby County v. Holder case, it is a strong reminder that work still needs to be done to protect the right to vote, whether that‚Äôs by increasing access to the polls or guaranteeing a secure election system. #RestoretheVOTEWe need to use every effective avenue to address the opioid epidemic and this is one we should absolutely embrace. https://t.co/2Y5PNyo9hJWhen I look at my kids, I don‚Äôt ever want to ask the questions: Where is my child? When will I see them again? Sadly, there are parents asking those same questions right now. President Trump owes a solution to the families at our border and a plan for reunification.After almost a week, President Trump still does not have a plan to reunite families, and seems like he has no intention to do so. #Familiesbelongtogether and this cruel policy needs to stop.When policies are haphazardly thrown together, trauma and confusion are guaranteed to ensue. We must find a way to make sure families who are separated are reunited.Should be an exciting morning and we hope you‚Äôll join us! https://t.co/KYhuURdyY1TOMORROW at 10am downtown: @RepLaHood and I hope you'll join us and John Williams of WGN Radio for a great discussion across a variety of topics at John Marshall Law School. If you can join us, please RSVP here: https://t.co/HFhfuYgBXX‚Ä¶I'm proud to haved introduced this amendment but disappointed that it's necessary. https://t.co/LzUHrN4HkcWhat a Byrne https://t.co/vgeck7K0FSüëá https://t.co/KsfLXMtPr0Everyone should watch this https://t.co/qvwDvzZkM2A powerful thread to read on #WorldRefugeeDay and amid the current crisis of our government dividing families https://t.co/sDbypXid0wAt this point, I‚Äôm surprised Scott Pruitt didn‚Äôt buy any ‚Äútactical turtlenecks‚Äù https://t.co/8R1YC5BsNrInexcusable. https://t.co/PBWYCb190zPresident Trump's #executiveorder requires the Pentagon to make space and facilities available to build family detention camps on military bases. To prevent that, I've introduced an amendment to block any military funding from going to internment camps. https://t.co/fwAglstRVY https://t.co/ke3uKDL9huAfter claiming to be powerless to end the crisis his administration created, President Trump has admitted the truth, but this #ExecutiveOrder is merely exchanging one type of child trauma for another. https://t.co/vc04zMSmDt https://t.co/doLrthnUDRThe #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct prioritizes family unity and requires the @DHSgov provide parents with a report containing information about their children. This is the first step in making this horrible situation just mildly better.Immigration agents should be required to complete child welfare training.  If they are put in charge of taking care of children, they must be trained so that long lasting trauma is never a possibility.  #KeepFamiliesTogetherActAs a member of the @OversightDems, I am committed to making sure children are not forcefully taken away ever again.  The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct will require Congressional oversight and public understanding of the use of family separation.Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy is the sole reason why children are being ripped from their families.  The #KeepFamiliesTogtherAct aims at stopping that from happening.It‚Äôs a sad day when that‚Äôs the more positive of the possible explanations https://t.co/LDJmMliIYtAlready the Governors of Maryland, Massachusetts and other states have taken the moral stance that they will not allow their National Guard troops to participate in border activities until the family separation crisis ends. Gov. Rauner should do the same.
https://t.co/iefIdMA4KQ https://t.co/HAxFxRTeLUThe history of #Juneenth is hugely important but so its legacy amid the challenges we're confronting today.
https://t.co/4nDJRzM4rzI'm proud to cosponsor the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to end the Trump administration's policy of separating families at the border.l https://t.co/kD40ej3HGRThank you, Dara, for helping to get the facts out and explain them with the necessary context (but please eat soon, it might make the math easier).
If you care about the family separation crisis but aren't already following @DLind, you should be. https://t.co/lYnNvG53MgThanks so much for coming by to discuss this vital issue with me. https://t.co/c66d2uAXWr@Prof_Malhotra, an ally of mine in passing gun safety legislation, is out with a new book #NegotiatingTheImpossible that offers an in-depth look on how deals can be sealed in the most difficult situations. Check out @Prof_Malhotra and his work here: https://t.co/S7y1IOx5E9The facts that need to be stated aloud in 2018... https://t.co/qFO1xClhcsWhen the Trump administration says they aren‚Äôt responsible for this policy and can‚Äôt choose to end it tomorrow, don‚Äôt believe them. https://t.co/dpTcg9t5zwUseful fact check on the gross mischaracterizations and false claims made by Secretary Nielsen. https://t.co/DXsoIth77xThis is not true. Period. https://t.co/LMyQpVIg45When it's something being deliberately coordinated between multiple agencies at the order of the President of the United States, it doesn't matter what you call it, it's still a policy. https://t.co/BWAw5VpTgVGlad to see them speaking out. https://t.co/Jh7vlMSeeyDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen opposed the policy of separating families until President Trump personally demanded it. When he made his decision, she went along with it despite knowing the costs and warning him of them. Today, she just defended that policy from the White House. https://t.co/eBRDs2eLuOI‚Äôve joined with my colleagues on legislation to end the Trump administration policy of separating families, and I will continue to fight to reunite families because tearing parents from their children is beneath the United States and all civilized people.
https://t.co/vjBFaH69Zz https://t.co/l9ggw4lpEjRegardless of what she says during the rest of this news conference, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen either hasn't seen this or she just doesn't care. https://t.co/g2YSwt0Rh6This is the sound of the Trump administration's immigration policy at work. https://t.co/g2YSwt0Rh6Listen to this. Listen and know that your government is responsible. Listen to agents of your government call crying children an "orchestra." Listen and ask yourself: what would I do if this was my child? This must end but it cannot end soon enough.  https://t.co/Ti8FiV6UV8This can't continue. I'm working with colleagues to end this policy and calling for hearings on how it ever came into effect but we're not going to be able to stop or it stop something similar from happening again if Republicans aren't willing to speak out against it. https://t.co/X0orBAXdP7I hope everyone has a wonderful Father's Day today and has the chance to catch up with their family while remaining mindful of those families unable to do the same.
I also want to wish my dad an especially happy Father's Day today. https://t.co/lnuMHzAi31Children are not pawns for the use of adults and tearing them from their parents should never be a negotiating tool for anyone, let alone the President of the United States of America. https://t.co/Z4z85LpdXrI'm proud to be a cosponsor of the Homeless Veteran Families Act, a bipartisan bill to provide more resources to help homeless veterans and their children. https://t.co/LqvH8asVUtThe immigration bills the House leadership is holding a vote on next week will do nothing to end this cruel policy which was instituted by the Trump administration under the specific direction of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
https://t.co/pKjYdR70IwHappy #IDY2018 to all those participating with @IndianEmbassyUS on the West Lawn of the Capitol.

Please, read this entire thread by Professor @KevinMKruse https://t.co/QNGVbER81OI'm disappointed President Trump unilaterally ended our exercises with South Korea, without alerting our allies in advance.

Happy #WorldBloodDonorDayScott Pruitt should no longer be running the EPA and Americans deserve to know how he's tried to use his office for personal gain, including a chicken franchise. Since the White House asked him to stop having lunch there, he could always use his $43,000 taxpayer-paid phone booth. https://t.co/1d7tga5LC6No surprise a Jedi would stand proudly with Kelly Marie Tran against sexist and racist harassment, but all of us should. https://t.co/cbGt9s2hysWhile I won't be able to attend, I want to encourage those who can to do so and to send everyone involved my best wishes.

This was a 7-2 ruling where the majority's decision has limited breadth. In a contrasting case, a 5-4 decision could have a huge scope.Thanks to Senator McCain for his continued commitment to immigration reform as he continues his own challenging fight. https://t.co/YfwZeKJcTbI'm disappointed with this #SCOTUS ruling because no one deserves to be turned away because of their sexual orientation.

Although that system may need reforms, taking young children away from their families is simply not the solution.  #FamiliesBelongTogetherWith a plan to tear families apart, the Trump administration has yet to determine a plan to guarantee reunification.  This is not what American values are and the people seeking refuge in our country deserve better than that #FamiliesBelongTogetherA humanitarian crisis is happening at our borders and something must be done.

https://t.co/Kpa2WNpGwzCongress must be willing to stand by those who would uphold the law and the barriers between the presidency and the Department of Justice.

Here's my op-ed on why we must protect this program which has helped millions of families and children in times of need, including me . https://t.co/Dbpu8VyQ10Last week, Congresswoman @HerreraBeutler and I introduced our bipartisan legislation, the Ending Maternal Mortality Act, to create an ambitious national plan to halve rates of maternal mortality and morbidity over the next decade, and end preventable maternal deaths within two. https://t.co/mEI0To1ZMoWonderful news, now it's our turn in the House to do our job to save #NetNeutrality https://t.co/RgtJci2nUzBy protecting an open internet, we can help level the playing field for small businesses and innovators in our district. I am proud to stand with you to save #NetNeutrality.#NetNeutrality is about keeping the internet free and open, for everything from e-commerce to streaming video to swirly banners on purple backgrounds. https://t.co/u02tsIZy0kToday is the day that the Senate will vote on #NetNeutrality. The House will hopefully vote on similar legislation soon, and I am proud to support it. We must continue to fight for a free and fair internet.Years of underfunding has led to crumbling roads, bridges and transit systems across the country. We need to modernize America‚Äôs infrastructure. It‚Äôs #TimeToBuildAmerica has put off investing in our infrastructure for too long. It‚Äôs #TimeToBuild https://t.co/roaxACCqk1It‚Äôs #TimeToBuild.

I hope your family will have the chance to catch up today.

Learn more about our bill here: https://t.co/2bD3XXgrfm ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/flboLZPwJO@mattyglesias I'm also reminded of Professor Shklar's thought that "it seems to me that liberal and humane people, of whom there are many among us, would, if they were asked to rank the vices, put cruelty first. Intuitively they would choose cruelty as the worst thing we do."I never expected to see an American presidential administration bring such new relevance to the works of Judith Shklar on cruelty and injustice, but this one has. https://t.co/jAer9JoOdIThe GOP farm bill would slash SNAP, our premiere anti-hunger program, by $20 billion. Meals from #SNAP and its predecessors have helped lift millions of families from poverty and prevented millions of children from going to bed hungry. I know, because I was once one of them. https://t.co/l74fUvxNMXAn American hero is fighting for his life and everyone needs to be better than to joke about it. Senator McCain has dedicated his life to service. I've disagreed with him, frequently, but I've never questioned his character or his love for our country. This is a time for kindness https://t.co/a9W3tHnj7OThis #MothersDay let‚Äôs protect our mothers across the nation with quality legislation that works to end to maternal mortality crisis.What‚Äôs a good #MothersDay present?

Thanks to our expert panelists from the Solar Energy Industries Association, Intersect Energy, MIT Photovoltaics Laboratory, and Summit Ridge Energy. https://t.co/2GzOwrKI1zI‚Äôve always enjoyed chatting with Father Conroy around the House floor. Put a Hindu and a Jesuit in an elevator and I guess you either end up at votes or a punchline. But in all seriousness, we need to know why Speaker Ryan did this. https://t.co/xgZGpKtqQGI don't know for certain why Speaker Ryan asked for Father Conroy's resignation, but I do know Father Conroy, I admire him, and I'm certain he deserved better than this.
https://t.co/vBNvPskD9nWe can't choose our careers, our successes or our honors, but each day, we can choose the type of people we'll try to be. @BarackObama  has always been more concerned with being a good man than a great one, and he served our country all the better for that. https://t.co/8NBKNAjWIBThanks for coming by, Dan!
