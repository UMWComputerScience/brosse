Thank you to the @WashTimes for highlighting my bill to strengthen Medicare and ensure seniors have access to the gold standard of care for opioid addiction. You can read the full article here!
https://t.co/YM8SwOkBw8Today I proudly supported our troops by voting to give them a 2.6% pay raise and ensure that spouses and children of fallen heroes get their benefits even in the event of a government shutdown. I will always fight to support our troops and their families. It’s the least we can doWith the slower summer season comes road and lane closures that can affect your morning or evening commute. Take a look at this recap compiled by @TDSColinAtagi to see if you may be impacted!
https://t.co/rFWva1uTjbIt was a pleasure to meet with constituents from the Alzheimer’s Association who came to my office to express their support for H.R. 1676. I am proud to have answered their call by cosponsoring this important bill so we can ensure universal access to quality palliative care. https://t.co/n2xR6BIa7AI just helped to pass H.R. 6, a bipartisan bill that will help our nation’s effort to combat the opioid epidemic. Now it, along with my bill to strengthen Medicare and help ensure our seniors have access to the gold standard of care for opioid misuse disorder, head to the Senate!Young children forcibly separated from their mother’s arms suffer from toxic stress and irreversible psychological trauma. That’s why I’m demanding an immediate hearing to investigate whether HHS is providing adequate care for these young children. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/0K4ris9XgsRight now, veterans are developing rare, debilitating, and fatal illnesses that most probably are linked to their exposure to #BurnPits. The VA and DOD must stop the excuses and start giving our veterans the care they need. @BurnPit360 @IAVA https://t.co/9cZSCCwJYuBefore votes in the Capitol earlier this week, I met with 7th and 8th graders from Palm Desert Charter Middle School and they had some great questions. I’m not sure the students got the answer they were expecting for the last one! https://t.co/zd3wgGmOZ2We have a responsibility to treat all children with respect, dignity, and humanity. (4/4)This trauma will have severe long-term health consequences and puts many of   these children at great risk of human trafficking. I am appalled by the Administration’s policies and they must end. (3/4)Many of these children are seeking asylum from unspeakable violence and this administration is adding to their suffering by imposing the extreme psychological trauma of being separated from their parents. (2/4)Separating young children from their parents is horrifying and inhumane, and goes against the very core of our values as Americans. (1/4)Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is a little-known liver disease that affects an estimated 30 million adults in America. Today is #NashDay to increase awareness about this disease.

I will not stop working for you during this government shutdown. My office will be open to answer your questions and concerns. I am here to serve you.That is why I voted no today &amp; I urge Congressional leadership from both parties to work together, end the partisan dysfunction, &amp; avoid a government shutdown. I am committed to continuing to find lasting bipartisan solutions that make government work for the American people. 4/4Congress must stop kicking the can down the road and instead make bipartisan and reasonable progress to fund our military, children’s health care and community health centers, disaster relief, and a solution for our Dreamers once and for all. 3/4It is the fourth short-term funding bill, which is a harmful and irresponsible way to govern. 2/4I have been working tirelessly for long-term, bipartisan, budget solutions that will help our government serve the American people. Unfortunately, Congress voted on yet another stop gap, temporary funding measure today. 1/4These goals have widespread support across the country and across the aisle. Congress must act now to put people above partisanship and do the right thing. Republican leaders should bring this bill to the floor for a vote immediately. 4/4The USA Act is currently the most bipartisan, pragmatic, and viable solution that provides an earned path to citizenship for Dreamers and increases resources for border security technology to keep our nation safe. 3/4I have advocated for years for a permanent solution for Dreamers and have been calling for months for a vote on legislation to protect the incredible young people who only know America as their home. That is why today I helped introduce the USA Act. 2/4Dreamers are hardworking students and young people in our military who make incredible contributions to our economy and help keep our nation secure. 1/4Rep. Don Young and I might not always agree, but we have found ways to work together, sponsoring each other’s bills to improve access to recreation opportunities for vets and increase resources for communities recovering from wildfires.

It gives 83% of the tax breaks to the wealthiest 1% and explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion.We must get answers for our vets exposed to burn pits. That's why 22 of my colleagues and I signed a bipartisan letter urging leaders of the House Armed Services Committee to hold a hearing to examine the use of burn pits and the health risks associated with exposure. https://t.co/CWZp0enuxHI joined 118 of my colleagues in asking the @FCC to delay the vote on #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/LPsb3yqa9zWe should modernize our tax code to help hardworking families &amp; small businesses spark the economy.

Brad Wenstrup: https://t.co/uvtlP8G97wToday the House passed a long-overdue bill to require anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training for members and staff. I require this of my staff and every Member should do the same.Wishing you a Happy Thanksgiving from me, my wife Monica, and my girls Sky and Sage!…Consumer protections that allow everyone to have control of the content they see online and small business to thrive digitally. I will continue to fight for #netneutrality to ensure all Americans have access to a free and open internet.We all rely on the internet — to apply for jobs, further our education, stay in touch with our family and friends, and even read this tweet. Unfortunately, today's proposal by the FCC to roll back existing #netneutrality oversight will eliminate critical consumer protections…I take the issue very seriously &amp; my office has a long-standing, zero tolerance policy for such behavior. I require my staff to complete annual harassment training &amp; believe all Congressional offices should be required to. I encourage every employer in America to do the same. 3/3Sexual harassment and abuse have no place in any work setting, whether farm fields, movie studios, corporate boardrooms, newsrooms, or the halls of Congress. 
2/3I am grateful for the courage survivors of sexual harassment and abuse have shown in telling their stories and am furious at the unacceptable behavior they have experienced. 1/3Confirmed by @USCBO: the current tax proposal will trigger a $25 billion cut to Medicare next year alone and over $100 billion in the next 4 years, all to give massive tax cuts to the wealthy. https://t.co/zWtS0SqNhkMillions of middle-class families will see a tax increase under the current tax proposal. Retweet if you oppose raising taxes on millions of hardworking Americans.It does all this while giving tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and big corporations that ship jobs overseas. This is unacceptable; we must protect Medicare, middle class families, seniors, and veterans. 3/3Unfortunately, the current plan double taxes families in my district, raises taxes on 38 million middle class families, cuts Medicare up to $100 billion within four years, and makes it harder for veterans who are unemployed or homeless to get help. 2/3I do want to simplify our tax code and I do want tax reform, a tax reform that relieves the burden on the middle class, seniors, veterans, and students. 1/3We need clarity in leadership and an adaptable, rapid-response plan to help Puerto Rico fully recover and rebuild.

Why all 50 state Medicaid directors oppose #Trumpcare 10/@CenterOnBudget @AmerMedicalAssn @AARP Do GOP leaders really think older Americans should be forced to pay up to 5X more for coverage, at a time when they need care the most? 9/@CenterOnBudget @AmerMedicalAssn Senior organizations like @AARP also oppose #GrahamCassidy because the Age Tax will force older Americans to pay skyrocketing premiums 8/@CenterOnBudget This is unacceptable &amp; why provider organizations like @AmerMedicalAssn oppose #GrahamCassidy. Read their letter https://t.co/CJJgouNulk 7/@CenterOnBudget Gutting those protections puts patients who need care the most at risk and makes emergency, maternity, and mental care harder to access 6/@CenterOnBudget Let’s break that down. First, #Trumpcare guts protections for those w/ pre-existing illnesses and weakens essential benefits. 5/@CenterOnBudget As an emergency physician, I am here to tell you this bill will harm patients, forcing families to pay more for less coverage. 4/@CenterOnBudget Read the report here https://t.co/KrbYg67kWo. Bottom line - at least 32 million lose coverage due to block grants and cuts to fed funding 3/Let’s be clear, millions of Americans will lose access to health care, according to several independent analyses like @CenterOnBudget 2/It's a critical week in the fight to #ProtectOurCare, so here are the most harmful parts of #GrahamCassidy, worst version of #Trumpcare 1/16I spoke with @AlexWitt on the need to sound the alarm on the dangers of the latest #Trumpcare.

Americans can't afford the latest #Trumpcare.Our parents and grandparents can't afford the age tax that #GrahamCassidy would impose on them.Say NO to the worst version of #Trumpcare yet. #GrahamCassidy = pay more for less coverage and guts protections for pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/ngECJszubfTune in today at 12:45pm ET for a discussion on health care with experts from @harvardmed and @HMSbioethics #policyethx. https://t.co/nHwmBnOMVFI introduced #MarketplaceCertaintyAct to fund CSRs, stabilize marketplace, and help bring down cost of health care: https://t.co/8B4WZUpx3M7M families rely on Cost Sharing Reductions to afford health care.
