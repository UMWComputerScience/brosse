#FaceIt 
#FightIt #YouFindHopeThroughStruggleI'm deeply saddened by the shooting at #CapitalGazette in Annapolis &amp; horrified that journalists were attacked like this. Praying for all victims and their loved ones.  

#Enough is enough. Congress must pass commonsense gun legislation to prevent further tragedy.https://t.co/ZgZceOfFmUFor that reason, I do not believe the Judiciary Committee should or can in good conscience consider a nominee put forward by this President until that investigation is concluded. 5/5Should we be considering a Supreme Court nominee from a President who has a history of demanding these loyalty tests and could be responsible for participating in something that could undermine the Mueller investigation?

My answer is, no. 4/We‚Äôve seen numerous people that are close to the President or on his campaign who have plead guilty ‚Ä¶ and we have a President who in the past seemed to ask people for loyalty tests. 3/The President of the United States is a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation ‚Äì an investigation that every member of the Judiciary Committee knows could end up before the Supreme Court. 2/Regarding this Supreme Court vacancy: among the many consequential issues at stake, there is clearly a potential conflict of interest for President @realDonaldTrump. 1/In Judiciary Hearing. 

I will argue, among other things, that we should wait until after the election (McConnell rule) to hear and vote on a Supreme Court nominee. https://t.co/u7jVi45y8pFrom low wages to short-termism, today‚Äôs corporations are keeping American workers from reaching their dreams.

Trump won‚Äôt allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs. He won‚Äôt allow for importation of drugs from other countries.It‚Äôs time to not only legalize marijuana, but to expunge the records of those who have been carrying the burdens of past convictions for too long.
