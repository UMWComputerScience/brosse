#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/QgB4COfog5Thank you Camden Mayor Moran, NJ Senator Cruz-Perez &amp; #SouthJersey faith leaders who joined me today to stand strongly against family separations &amp; in support of the Restoring Oversight for Members of Congress Act.

#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/KQRgYfCCymCurious what happened involving my visiting separated children in #SouthJersey? 

I explain the situation in this video

Please know - this doesn’t end with my giving up. I plan to visit CFS in July &amp; helped introduce a bill with @JoaquinCastrotx to restore oversight for members https://t.co/NDzLbQLMfdI proudly stood with faith leaders &amp; members of our diverse #Camden community today to say that:1)separating families is un-American &amp; inhuman 
2)we have a bill to allow the people’s representatives to immediately visit separated children

#KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/Gvb3yuBD4IAhead of the final weekend of #Pride, we told President Trump we're disappointed his Administration has again failed to recognize #LGBT #PrideMonth &amp; shared broad concerns about efforts to turn back the clock on LGBT rights. @DavidCicilline

#EnoughIsEnough“After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, they instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia...

This is disgraceful.

Let's work together &amp; provide the resources to combat the disease of addiction. #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/SEYmFiWWo6New Jersey is a top #solar state &amp; we must make sure we support our clean-energy workforce.

This #solartariff move is bad for our state &amp; I oppose it --&gt; "President Trump Slaps Tariffs on Solar Panels in Major Blow to Renewable Energy" via @TIME: https://t.co/CE0v7YRtcJ https://t.co/KeLqDuz1m4Republicans have proven they cannot govern w/o self-inflicted crises, short-term fixes &amp; blaming Democrats. Unfortunately, we still don't have a long-term spending bill to address our defense &amp; domestic needs.

My full statement on the #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/vq0uSCD2LiGlad to see the GREEN gear. #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/1cNGSQvozB@keithellison Thanks! Appreciate the sportsmanship &amp; hope you're rooting for the @Eagles in the #SuperBowl.I’m looking forward to enjoying some Minnesota wild rice from @keithellison in honor of our NFC champions - the Philadelphia @Eagles!

@Eagles #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/eW5eNRVZ6U#WomensMarch2018 #WomensMarchNJ #WomensMarchDC https://t.co/LkryW4yxz3This is the first time in our country’s history that a real government shutdown has happened with a single party controlling the White House, House &amp; Senate.

#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/hM1i2puh4aThere is no such thing as a “good shutdown.”

Let’s end this.

#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/OokFtqm6d7#TrumpShutdown #WomensMarch2018 https://t.co/NQcb6d1iOoOn our way to the #WomensMarch! 

We’re proud to see people speaking up for what is right in DC &amp; around the country during this #TrumpShutdown.

#WomansMarch2018 #WomensMarchNJ #PhillyWomensMarch #TimesUp #EqualPay https://t.co/7ST4oiJgkEDo furloughed federal employees get back pay?

That is up to the House, Senate &amp; White House. In 2013, furloughed employees received back-pay through the enactment of legislation.

...I hope this information helps &amp; that the #Trumpshutdown doesn’t last long.

11/11What is the impact on food safety activities?

The FDA is unable to support the majority of its food safety activities. 
10/11What is the impact on medical research &amp; the CDC?

NIH shuts down most medical research &amp; the CDC has to stop flu season monitoring, as well as treatment &amp; prevention recommendations. 
9/11What is the impact on federal housing loans?

The Federal Housing Administration stops approving applications for housing loans. 
8/11What is the impact on small businesses?

The shutdown halts federal loans to small businesses.
7/11What is the impact on US military personnel?

The Defense Department says, “Military personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties.” 
6/11What is the impact on veterans’ services?

All VA medical facilities &amp; clinics remain fully operational. However, VA call centers &amp; Veterans Benefits Admin public contact services are not available.
5/11Will I still be able to visit the national parks and monuments?

During the 2013 shutdown, national parks, monuments &amp; Smithsonian museums were closed. The Trump Admin said it will work to keep national parks “as accessible as possible.”
4/11Will my mail still arrive?

Yes. The ~500,000 Postal Service employees are exempt from a furlough because the Postal Service is self-funded.
3/11Will I continue to receive my Social Security &amp; SSI checks?

Yes. You’ll continue to receive Social Security &amp; SSI checks. However, new Social Security cards will not be issued.
2/11THREAD: For South Jerseyans with questions about what the #TrumpShutdown means for you &amp; your family, here are some helpful Q&amp;As...
1/11I captured the @CNNPolitics countdown clock with one second to go before the #TrumpShutdown.

By the time you read this, the Federal Government will officially be shut down. Very sad day for America. https://t.co/n7ItlaaUGNLast year President Trump tweeted the ‘country needs a good shutdown’ &amp; today, sadly, he got his wish.
 
Republicans control the House… the Senate… &amp; the White House. There is no doubt that full responsibility for this shutdown rests solely on their shoulders.
#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/MfZIaQiNiBOpioid overdose deaths increased by 28%, but they're suggesting cutting funds by 95%?!

Don't they realize there's an #OpioidCrisis?!

We need MORE resources to fight this epidemic, not less. We're losing loved ones to the disease of addiction!

https://t.co/zkHLlxhuHOThis photo from my daughter sums up how I feel today. 

A government shutdown because we are trying to help children?! Come on. We can do better than this. #SaveCHIP #DREAMActNow https://t.co/s9RhrJUe0iWin the rice, still eat the cheesesteak. Am I right?

#MLKDay2018 https://t.co/6Y2VhL6Ew5#MLKDay https://t.co/z459VcK986The comments by President Trump are disgraceful &amp; do not represent American values.

We unveiled our new legislative agenda &amp; one of our bills was signed into law.

Check out our new agenda here: https://t.co/MnpETpiFPQ https://t.co/G9t5DnFYzfIn #NJ, deaths from heroin &amp; fentanyl overdoses more than tripled in the last five years. That’s tragic &amp; unacceptable. We must invest time, effort &amp; money to save lives.

@camdencountynj @LouisCappelliJr @DeptfordTwp @PennsaukenTwpI absolutely oppose this decision that could lead to drilling off the Jersey shore.

We need the Administration to listen to our coastal communities, not the Big Oil companies, &amp; keep our shores safe, secure &amp; oil-free!

https://t.co/UbIgfNYfJJToday New Jersey mourns the passing of our elder statesman.

@CityofCamdenGov @CityWoodburyNJ @BrooklawnBoroNJ @runnemedenj @MerchantvilleNJ @LoganTownshipNJ @Audubon_NJThis #minimumwage increase is far too small. Full-time working Americans deserve a fair day's pay for a hard day's work.

I'm looking forward to the new #NJ gov moving to $15/hour &amp; I'll keep up the #FightFor15 in Congress w/the #RaiseTheWage Act.

...that's who the @HouseGOP is throwing under the bus – &amp; now they’re celebrating w/the President about it. #GOPTaxScamWATCH LIVE: I'm speaking on the @HouseFloor to honor Mrs. Riletta Cream, a @CamdenCountyNJ legend who passed away yesterday. She will be missed.

https://t.co/lOUr9NA0K1This may be the worst vote ever for those who live in #NJ – unless you're part of the top, top 1%. Unbelievable!

By the way, 11 of 12 NJ Representatives voted NO! There's BIPARTISAN agreement that this hurts NJ families.

Full statement: https://t.co/oOsd0lpuxE https://t.co/MysV619nxoToday Republicans in Congress chose to line the pockets of billionaires, the Trump family &amp; big corporations at the expense of New Jersey families.

I voted NO --&gt; https://t.co/oOsd0lpuxE https://t.co/8xtq1wlsRWRepublicans are currently voting to raise taxes on 86 million middle-class Americans – including #NewJersey residents who will no longer be able to use their full state &amp; local tax deductions.

#GOPTaxScam https://t.co/6wavzTaHGHHeading to vote NO to the #GOPTaxScam.

ICYMI - here's why: https://t.co/O7oVQz0eP2 https://t.co/sFk5Ebx9bHWe must do everything we can to improve rail safety &amp; prevent derailments – PTC is an important part of that.

The #NJ delegation supports PTC (https://t.co/YNs2XEuRqt) – let's get our colleagues on board! https://t.co/8e46kFqqWhGlad to see this. 

Former Rep. Garrett repeatedly voted to kill the #EXIM Bank... then he was nominated to lead it. Didn't make sense.

#ThrowbackTuesday: My #NJ colleagues &amp; I strongly opposed this confirmation: https://t.co/kHY2Bn6oYi https://t.co/BYLlVJh66VI send my condolences &amp; prayers to the victims of the Washington train derailment &amp; will follow the investigation closely.

I remain concerned about derailments during this holiday season &amp; recently sent a letter to the Pres, @TSA &amp; @DHSgov on rail safety: https://t.co/Y7yjh9Be5eHappy 230th birthday #NewJersey!
