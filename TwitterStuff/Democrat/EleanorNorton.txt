This week, 22 Republicans cosponsored a bill to grant statehood to Puerto Rico. I too support that bill, and I’m calling on those same Republicans, as a matter of principle and fairness, to cosponsor our #DCStatehood bill. https://t.co/9xBeVQ7Je2So sorry I had to miss the naming of @dcwater’s tunnel boring machine. I’ll keep fighting to get annual federal funds for DC Water’s work for clean-up and flood control—last year we secured $14 million. I'll be there to celebrate the finished tunnel and milestones along the way! https://t.co/mZBRwNjlUdThank you, @martcw12 for celebrating #PrideMonth in the best way possible and being a role model for all young #LGBT athletes. We miss having you play for @dcunited and wish you all the best! https://t.co/wwPqYtYxl1I introduced bills this week to remove federal officials from DC’s local land-use boards—the Zoning Commission and the Board of Zoning Adjustment. Both have no say over fed land and fed officials should have no say on DC’s local land use. Expanding home rule pending #DCStatehood.Trump’s “corrective” order to end family separation at the border turns now to holding them indefinitely on military bases, imprisoning desperate asylum seekers in modern day internment camps. See my brief House floor remarks for a humane alternative. https://t.co/pTuCDs9u3tI'm going to the House floor to speak out against Trump's plan to house immigrant families and children on military bases. I'm an original cosponsor of an amendment to prohibit funds from being used for such purposes.Welcome to DC, @WayneRooney! #DCU https://t.co/6fTfvtDu7fToday’s SCOTUS decision harming working Americans must redouble our efforts to fight with our #Union brothers and sisters for fair wages and safe workplaces. It must strengthen our resolve to help Americans understand what all lose if bosses alone decide wages. #Janus https://t.co/zc2V07QsOPA reminder to DC residents to get tested today on National #HIVTestingDay! We have made significant progress on reducing the HIV/AIDS rate in DC since I got the deadly congressional rider removed that kept DC from spending its local funds on a needle exchange program. #HandsOffDCI’m an original cosponsor of H.Res 405 to make June 26 #LGBTEquality Day! Today we celebrate a landmark 3 years since marriage equality, 5 years since DOMA was struck down, and 15 years since the end of the ban on same-sex private intimate relations. #LoveIsLove #LoveWins https://t.co/Zwk2ZL1miBIt took Trump four tries to get a version of his #MuslimBan approved. Today’s shameful but narrow 5-4 decision encourages our efforts to keep fighting until we get the SCOTUS Americans deserve. #NoMuslimBanEverContinuing to maximize home rule pending #DCStatehood, I’m introducing a bill to give DC the power to appoint all members of the DC Zoning Commission and remove its fed officials. Land use is a quintessential local issue. The Commission should be accountable only to DC residents.Spot on, Deborah on giving Rock Creek Park the “National” name our nation’s third oldest national park deserves.  My bill for this name change will help us raise private and public funds to support this crown jewel in the middle of a big city. https://t.co/TEfjLw7vyrOur recent community meeting on keeping the Mall open for organized and pick-up sports allowed residents to speak directly to NPS. NPS agreed not to restrict access without more feedback and study. Thank you Wash Post for supporting a hometown tradition. https://t.co/fdeEsS8NosIf the Catholic Church, one of the world’s most conservative institutions, can use the LGBT name and begin to reach out, when will Republicans catch up?I called out Senators for sending DC’s fed taxpaying residents to the back of the line in a bill creating state coins honoring inventors. I’ve gotten wins to make DC equal w/ the states on our road to #DCStatehood. I won’t stand by while DC is disrespected https://t.co/QWa77gXEjMInstead of these so-called “compromise” immigration bills, we need to immediately take up and pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act and the #DREAM Act, both of which I’m a proud cosponsor. Enough of the posturing. We must protect children on the border and our DREAMers here at home.I’m introducing a bill to give @councilofdc control over our local courts—part of my two-track #FreeAndEqualDC strategy to maximize DC home rule on the road to #DCStatehood. https://t.co/fi1IRjkQBUJust testified to put “National” in Rock Creek Park’s name—which will help me get public and private funding for the park.

Similar to my other bill that has moved to the Senate to allow private and DC gov’t funds to be used to upgrade Franklin Park and other NPS-owned DC parks. https://t.co/Xaib1xvSkHRock Creek Park is the nation’s oldest urban park and the third oldest federal park. It is a true crown jewel among the nation's national parks and deserves this updated recognition. https://t.co/R7DC10GO9HThis morning at 10:00am, I'll be testifying on my bill to rename Rock Creek Park "Rock Creek National Park." I want to ensure DC residents and visitors to the nation’s capital know it is among the nation’s great and historic national parks.

MWAA cannot operate two federally-owned airports while shielding its CEO’s full compensation from Congress and the public. https://t.co/X1LyskjK7zHappy #Juneteenth as we reflect on freedom 153 years since the end of slavery on June 19, 1865. I hope all DC residents take time today to reflect on achieving freedom by recommitting to do even more to make the District of Columbia the 51st state. #DCStatehood https://t.co/Xu1loInFY2Today I introduced my bill to allow cannabis use in public housing in DC and states where it’s legal for medical and/or recreational use. I signed the bill with Sondra Battle, a DC resident who lives in Section 8 housing and is prescribed cannabis to treat her fibromyalgia. https://t.co/iyvUzpPMvAStarting now! Our community meeting with National Park Service and other officials on the ability of residents to play organized sports on the National Mall. Still time to come make your voice heard. 2167 Rayburn House Office Building. https://t.co/6KmxxhNyhqPerhaps the most painful part of Congress’ denial of democracy in DC is denying our residents the vote on whether to go to war. DC residents have fought and died in every war in our nation’s history, including the war based on #TaxataionWithoutRepresentation #DCStatehood. https://t.co/IfOcBFdZe1Even some of my Republican colleagues are beginning to speak out against the inhumanity of tearing children from parents at the border. I’ve spoken out against these cruel policies on the floor and will continue to do so until Trump feels the pressure. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Dq99i84x9DAs residents enjoy the summer season by playing games outdoors, join me tonight at 6:30pm on Capitol Hill for a special community meeting on National Park Service policies affecting organized sports on the National Mall.

One of the many reasons I presented on the House floor why DC is more than ready and deserving to become the 51st state #DCStatehood. https://t.co/g1eU2CsAo5Join us on Monday on Capitol Hill as we explore @NatlParkService policies affecting whether organized sports teams can play on the National Mall. Our community meeting will allow residents to be heard on how to ensure that the space is open and accessible for recreation. https://t.co/CnmJp8GfJ8I will file amendments on the House floor to strike the five anti-DC riders from the House DC spending bill. I got most of the riders removed last year and expect to have similar success again. #HandsOffDC https://t.co/iiLyXrD6F5Last week, I spoke for an hour on the House floor about the reasons why Congress must pass my #DCStatehood bill. One is the attacks on DC gun laws by @marcorubio and @RepTomGarrett. I’ve defeated them all, but to permanently protect our gun laws, DC must become the 51st state. https://t.co/mjh9LH7BGhOn the 6th anniversary of #DACA, I’m standing with the more than 800 DREAMers here in DC.

The American people are left with the bitter aftertaste.#DCEmancipationDay commemorates April 16, 1862, when slaves in the nation’s capital were freed 9 months before slavery was abolished nationwide.

DC, not Congress, decides who votes in DC. #HandsOffDCWe almost always disagreed, but on one issue @SpeakerRyan &amp; I saw eye to eye. He voted for my bill that passed the House (and later Senate) for a DC House vote. He showed democratic rights for DC residents wasn't a partisan issue then. Neither should #DCStatehood be partisan now.Today we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the #FairHousingAct, co-authored by DC native son Sen.

DC students are planning their town hall for later this month. Details to come soon. #TownHallForOurLives.@marcorubio doesn’t think DC should be able to enact local gun laws, falsely labeling DC a “federal jurisdiction” rather than a city w/ 700,000 fed taxpaying residents.

Our work in building record support has paid off.Going on the House floor to call out @marcorubio for refusing to withdraw his DC gun bill, which eliminates DC's total ban on guns in schools, its bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as its registration and age requirements. #HandsOffDC#DCTAG does not discriminate. Thousands of DCTAG students go to colleges from DC public, charter, and private schools. This unique federal law has met a primary purpose: to keep and attract DC residents. We will win our fight to keep DCTAG funding.Leaving the Capitol today, I applauded hundreds of brave #DACA protesters blocking the Independence Ave. entrance. We need their persistence to help us protect our Dreamers, who are as American as apple pie. #DreamActNowMy decade-long effort to secure $200 million in federal funds for the new Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge is about to take off. A beautiful new bridge will connect all of DC’s wards—and revenue-producing tourists as well. https://t.co/y5sRIRUPncMost #DCTAG students receive the maximum award annually. We will win our fight to keep #DCTAG funding.Exposed by #Parkland—@marcorubio’s pending bill to wipe out DC’s gun safety laws, including its assault weapons ban, led the NRA to boost his rating from B+ to A. Rubio still taking his marching orders from the NRA, not his constituents. #HandsOffDC https://t.co/9pHcf5dyzzNorton Steps Out of Her Congressional Role to Entertain at Hexagon, Tonight https://t.co/DZ696Yio3n via @@EleanorNortonWhat a pleasure to help dedicate @centralunion’s new Family Ministry Center! Unlike many organizations that help our most needy residents, @centralunion serves DC residents w/out any federal or local funds. Thank you @centralunion for more than a century of service to our city. https://t.co/sAgFOkKg2B.@marcorubio’s "Plan to Address Gun Violence" won't be credible as long as he refuses to withdraw his bill to eliminate nearly all gun safety laws in the nation’s capital. Allowing anyone to buy assault rifles in DC won’t address gun violence, it'll exacerbate it. #HandsOffDCWant to know what a presidential legacy looks like? A solid 54% majority of Americans now support Obamacare. The failed GOP repeal and replace made the ACA even more popular. #ThanksObamaI got DC included in a new tax incentives provision for businesses to invest in low-income communities in the corporate #GOPTaxScam bill I opposed. @MayorBowser is now seeking public input on our “opportunity zones.” Weigh in here: https://t.co/f7w3nRZmgwTo commemorate #WomensHistoryMonth, I’m hosting a celebration of African American women in ballet on March 22 at @DukeEllingtonDC. The public is invited and encouraged to attend! RSVP here: https://t.co/OBHYEKG1fr https://t.co/B1Zd9hydtvThank you, Clint for giving an amplified voice to our struggle. Only #DCStatehood will give our 700,000 taxpaying residents full voting rights &amp; free them from congressional interference. Our #DCStatehood bill has record support, but we need Americans like you to spread the word. https://t.co/NtNrv36GFK.@marcorubio’s DC gun bill would overturn DC’s ban on weapons of war, like those used in recent mass shootings, &amp; allow 18 yr olds to buy them. His bill would make assault weapons legal in DC, except in the Capitol, where all guns are banned under fed law. https://t.co/GT25bxwUQhOur region has a knowledge economy. That’s why our #DCTAG students are enrolled in both two and four-year colleges, but the great majority attend four-year colleges. We will win our fight to keep #DCTAG funding.Grateful to meet with the Hispanic National Bar Association and @HBADC on #DACA, El Salvador, Puerto Rico, criminal justice reform &amp; Trump’s lack of diversity in judicial nominees. We must do more to get legal counsel for unaccompanied alien children. https://t.co/evVlNJQ5mF@vcrazy8 @SenKamalaHarris @SenatorLeahy There are prototypes that exist now.Another #DCStatehood record broken—22 total Senate cosponsors! Thank you @SenKamalaHarris and @SenatorLeahy for standing with our residents and signing on to our bill to make DC the 51st state! Because we keep building momentum, our quest for statehood keeps moving..@marcorubio refuses to withdraw his DC gun bill allowing 18 yr olds here to purchase assault rifles, despite saying he supports raising the age to 21 nationally. Thank you @MiamiHerald for doing your job and exposing Rubio's rank hypocrisy. #HandsOffDC https://t.co/q5pNohzyxtThomas Farr’s nomination to the federal bench must be defeated. #FarrOut @NAACP  https://t.co/av4A9mFem1Standing strong with the @NAACP and NC activists to oppose the nomination of Thomas Farr to the federal bench. He’s a man who’s worked his entire career to disenfranchise African Americans. #FarrOut. Watch live: https://t.co/sjSKGQO3a6 https://t.co/9JxPPQdh6cSpoke at the naming of Wisc. Ave section in front of Russian Embassy for Boris Nemtsov, a Russian freedom fighter who was assassinated for fighting for democracy. Pleased House &amp; Senate Members participated, but I insisted @councilofdc, not Congress, rename this DC-owned street. https://t.co/vvFb5V11oy#DCTAG not only enables students to attend college in all 50 states, but helps ensure they have the funding they need to stay in college and complete their degrees. We will win our fight to keep #DCTAG funding..@marcorubio's DC gun bill would eliminate DC's ban on assault rifles &amp; allow 18 year olds to purchase them. At the #CNNTownHall, he professed support for raising the age for assault rifle purchases to 21. To maintain his credibility, he must withdraw his DC gun bill. #HandsOffDCToday’s #SCOTUS decision on #DACA is a victory, and all #Dreamers should apply for renewal. But thousands of Dreamers are still in jeopardy of losing their protection and being deported. Congress needs to act now and pass a permanent solution with the #DreamAct.I spoke at the #UnrigtheSystem rally on Saturday ahead of today’s #JanusvAFSCME case, a retread in the steady drumbeat to stamp out unions in our country. Labor unions have been at the heart of every victory for workers in our nation’s history. We need them now more than ever.Our #DCTAG students have been so successful that I have been able to get Republican and Democratic presidents and Republican and Democratic-controlled Congresses alike to support it. We will win our fight to keep #DCTAG funding.#DCTAG has bipartisan congressional support in the House and Senate because it not only benefits DC students, but also the economy of the states where DCTAG students attend college.Congratulations DC on reaching 700,000 residents and growing! We are well on our way of climbing back to DC’s peak population of more than 800,000. We can do this. #DC700K https://t.co/8MCNVTU7f4The 2015 median household income for #DCTAG families was $36,383, showing that many DC residents could not afford a college education without DCTAG. Another reason why we’re going to win our fight to maintain DCTAG funding.Fantastic news for local DC journalism! Looking forward to having @DCist back and reporting on the under-covered issues residents care about. https://t.co/SGvJD1MUTEA pending NRA-backed bill introduced by @marcorubio and @RepTomGarrett again seeks to allow guns in DC schools and out-of-state residents to carry in DC schools. We’ve defeated this bill every time, but out of respect for #Parkland it should immediately be withdrawn. #HandsOffDC.@marcorubio refused to back a nat'l assault weapons ban at CNN town hall. Did you know he introduced a bill to eliminate DC’s ban on assault weapons &amp; large capacity magazines &amp; that his DC gun bill boosted his NRA rating from B+ to A? We’ve stopped him every time. #HandsOffDCSince my bill created #DCTAG in 1999, our students receiving DCTAG have more than doubled. The domestic spending boost in the bipartisan budget agreement passed on February 9 will help us keep DCTAG funded.Thank you to the DC residents representing @FriendshipPCS and @TMAtalks at today’s WH listening session. They did not mince words about gun violence. I will use their stories to defeat GOP bills to eliminate DC’s gun safety laws, including our assault weapons ban. #EnoughIsEnoughAs part of my effort to highlight our fight for equality for DC residents, I’ve requested a tree be planted on Capitol grounds in recognition of the nation’s capital's nearly 700,000 residents, who pay fed taxes w/out a vote in Congress. #FreeAndEqualDC https://t.co/iSf372m9A5 https://t.co/TV5Fz4vZFmThank you to the students who have taken charge of #GunControl in the US. Hundreds of DC-area students made their voices heard today at the Capitol, telling Congress #EnoughIsEnough #EndGunViolence https://t.co/mZYQk2aJtaOver 5,000 DC students are enrolled in colleges in most of the states through #DCTAG. I'm working to ensure we maintain our DCTAG funding.#Parkland shooter used an assault weapon of war and large capacity ammunition magazine that DC, like a number of other jurisdictions, bans. @marcorubio and @RepTomGarrett have a bill to force DC, and only DC, to legalize these weapons and magazines. We will stop them. #HandsoffDC
