It’s disconcerting that four months after this scandal became public Facebook still has no idea how many others have its users’ data and how that data is being used today.Remain concerned that Facebook’s answers only raise more questions. It appears Facebook still doesn’t have an effective system in place to find other ‘Cambridge Analyticas’ or even who Cambridge Analytica shared users’ data with.NEWS: My colleagues on @EnergyCommerce &amp; I released @facebook’s long-awaited hearing responses.

https://t.co/8qBf3Oafj4We need to reunite families, correct the status of #dreamers and provide pathway to citizenship for the undocumented who have been here for yrs, paid taxes and not gotten in trouble with the law. #FamiliesBelongTogether #AsburyPark https://t.co/8KiEXyyarTI’ll be at the #FamiliesBelongTogether rally in @InAsburyParkNJ to let the Trump administration know that families need to be reunited immediately. Are you headed to a rally today?Great news! The courts just struck down the Trump Admin’s cruel attempts to restrict access to Medicaid.
I’ve opposed these heartless and illegal efforts since day one. We should be helping American families-not taking away health care.
This is why the courts are so important. https://t.co/i4LlIzHT6IUnveiling of the Thomas Mundy Peterson plaque at St. Peter’s Church in Perth Amboy, first African American to vote, pursuant to the 15th amendment. https://t.co/DbUz72ndHHWe’ve come a long way since Sandy-I’m proud to have helped enact the $60 billion relief package that let us begin rebuilding.

The Trump admin claims it is trying to resolve the situation but given it started this crisis the administration cannot be trusted.  I’m working to hold them accountable.
https://t.co/9m0f9DoYniIt’s time for Trump to finally stop appeasing Putin, hold Russia accountable &amp; restore our credibility on the world stage. No American President should cower in the face of a thug like Putin.Last time Trump met with Putin the president fell hook, line &amp; sinker for Russia's denials of interference in our elections.

https://t.co/3ARI9lkhAPA woman’s right to choose, marriage equality, voting rights &amp; so much more hang in the balance. We need to be ready to fight to defend the constitution and the rights that so many Americans have sacrificed for.With Justice Kennedy leaving the #SupremeCourt we can only expect President Trump to choose a far right justice who will defend his extreme policies &amp; his attacks on immigrants, minorities, women, the LGBTI community &amp; workers.This is NOT enough. We need a hearing NOW. #FamiliesBelongTogetherToday Republicans voted down my amendment to hold a hearing on family separation. Instead, they supported efforts championed by @EnergyCommerce Dems for updates and a strategy. https://t.co/qb0e6DKCPjWATCH: We have an obligation to conduct oversight on how separated children are being cared for &amp; how they can be reunited with their families. That's why I called for a @EnergyCommerce hearing on these issues. Amazingly Republicans refused to support holding a hearing. https://t.co/eUYQdpz6oRUPDATE: By a vote of 11-18, @HouseCommerce refused to support holding a hearing to investigate the welfare of the children held hostage by the Trump Administration. We need answers and Committee Republicans are burying their heads in the sand. #FamiliesBelongTogetherALERT: I offered an amendment to hold a hearing to investigate the welfare of the children who were forcibly separated from their parents by the Trump Administration. It’s past time to shine a light on this dire situation. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch https://t.co/sF42AL5fXMThe 5-4 decision in #Janus is yet another attack by the @GOP in its war against workers &amp; their right to organize.

https://t.co/IkMAHHlXlwBigoted and Feckless, the Travel Ban Is Pure Trump https://t.co/ouhvOywVkXTrump’s reckless policies have led to a significant increase in gasoline prices. Now he wants to blackmail NJ into accepting offshore drilling off its coast. Sorry, we’re not falling for it. https://t.co/5sAQGjknRVThese outrageous rates are one more insult as desperate parents try to weave their way through the bureaucracy to find their children. It is an inexcusable insult to injury.Today I introduced legislation to ensure immigrant parents can contact their separated children free of charge. In some instances, they are being charged as much as $8 per minute to talk to their children. #FamiliesBelongTogether

I’m fighting for #NetNeutrality to protect that right by forcing a vote in the House. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/IIu7xK5uthSeveral administrations, Republicans &amp; Democrat, worked with them &amp; many others in NJ to allow these families to remain in the US, where they became valuable members of their communities. Only when the Trump administration came into office did their presence become an issue.Met with members of Highland Park Reformed Church &amp; several children whose fathers have been detained by ICE and are currently being held in the Elizabeth Detention Center. The families came from Indonesia to America to avoid persecution of Christians there in the 1990s. https://t.co/2eiMB4hnkiNow we can see that Trump’s #TravelBan –enacted in the first week of the Trump administration- was just the first step in its incompetent, cruel &amp; extreme immigration policy that betrays American values of decency and compassion, while ripping families apart.The #Trump #TravelBan is still discriminatory &amp; contrary to American values. This #SCOTUS decision will lead to enormous pain and suffering for those seeking refuge. I will continue to do everything within my power to fight this ban.

Eliminating SALT deductions dramatically increased New Jersians’ overall tax rates, and I will keep fighting to bring them back down.Since passage of the #GOPTaxScam, average hourly earnings have not budged. In fact, a recent analysis of the data released by Trump’s @BLS_gov showed that average hourly earnings have actually gone down slightly.The Republican tax law is a scam that benefits the wealthy and corporate interests. The American people are not fooled, and no amount of misleading rhetoric is going to change that fact. #GOPTaxScamA @monmouthu poll shows that the majority of Americans are not fooled by the #GOPTaxScam – with only 34% approving of the law.Today’s hearing on #GOPTaxScam was nothing more than a blatant attempt by the Republican majority to tout its unpopular tax “plan” in the hopes that middle-class Americans – who are not seeing any substantial benefits– might just reconsider their opposition.WATCH as I expose the #GOPTaxScam for the lie it really is at this morning’s @EnergyCommerce hearing. https://t.co/CGCeELIegb“Pallone said his proposed legislation will ensure the FCC has the authority and tools to track down robocallers."

Congress needs to enact a national assault weapons ban ASAP.
https://t.co/QhgsoAXtPPIn the 21st century, access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right. I’m fighting for #NetNeutrality to protect that right. https://t.co/EuFqR2ljsxSenate Democrats move one step closer to forcing vote to #SaveTheInternet. Proud to support similar #NetNeutrality legislation here in the House.  The fight for a free and open internet continues. https://t.co/2deUFEdetJProud to announce that @colabarts of #NewBrunswick will receive a 50k @NEAarts grant to help fund its work assisting non-profits in NJ. https://t.co/lABRjSOA91BREAKING: @RutgersU to receive 856k @NSF grant to support the teaching of science in the classroom. Rutgers is both a world renowned research university &amp; an outstanding teaching institution. This grant will support these strengths in education and research. https://t.co/pNBVJctpjGI support the bills before @EnergyCommerce today but I’m concerned that many proposals that would meaningfully improve or expand treatment for opioid use disorders will not be discussed. We must expand access to life-saving, evidence-based treatment &amp; also focus on prevention. https://t.co/a7BTwwB9k0I stressed that it's not enough to only look backwards at this crisis.  We must take the necessary steps – like providing affordable &amp; quality health care – to actually help those who are suffering by providing comprehensive treatment to individuals and communities in need.WATCH my questions to pharma executives at an @energycommerce hearing today. There is simply no excuse for distributors sending more than 13 million doses of opioids to a single pharmacy in a town of just 400 people over a six year period. https://t.co/9WpiODL0U6Highlighted the importance of investment in EV infrastructure for our environment, the transportation industry and the American people. @realDonaldTrump should stop his shortsighted attacks on the industry and instead support federal investment efforts. https://t.co/CFQA3SZr4W#PresidentTrump was completely disingenuous about benefits of the #IranDeal. Security experts and international inspectors agree that Iran has halted nuclear activity under it – exactly what the deal was supposed to do. Leaving w no plan B is foolish and likely dangerous.The decision to withdraw from the Iran deal undercuts our allies like Great Britain, France, &amp; Germany who continue to express their desire to remain in the agreement. US will now be left w fewer opportunities to curb the development of nuclear weapons in #IranThe #IranDeal is not perfect, but it is our best chance to preserve peace and security. #PresidentTrump has yet to explain what the credible alternative is to the deal, or fully demonstrate that it understands the consequences of walking away.Today take a moment to reach out and thank the teachers who have made a difference in all of our lives. We should honor our teachers by supporting the necessary funding and resources to make all of our schools successful. #TeacherAppreciationDay https://t.co/iGR1PCVBQPAn accurate #2020census is critical to our nation. And the political decision by the Trump Administration to add an untested &amp; damaging question about citizenship to the #2020Census at the 11th hour will suppress participation. https://t.co/2UdjXFdv6H https://t.co/ANuSpYFt10“I mean, we’re going to build more bombs but now we’re going to cut health care for kids," said Pallone, D-N.J. "That says a lot about Republican values.”
https://t.co/RFjmyIPXxKOn the 2nd &amp; 4th Tuesdays of each month my office holds office hours at the Woodbridge Town Hall, from 9 am to 5 pm. Stop by to get assistance with numerous federal issues including Social Security, Medicare and Immigration. https://t.co/CwkWrdNTym https://t.co/kNiN7hiSjIEnding #TPS status for these individuals is both immoral and impractical given the conditions in their home countries and the contributions they are making to our communities everyday.

https://t.co/g7nfdQsY5ORemember that as Trump misleads &amp; deflects responsibility in his remarks, that we can take action to reduce gun violence now if the president, @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr would bring common sense solutions like universal background checks &amp; an assaults weapon ban to a vote.Today @realDonaldTrump traveled to Dallas to pander to the gun lobby at the @NRA conference. If today is an average day,  7 children will die from gun violence. 318 Americans total will be shot.#Trumpcare would have stolen health care from 469,500 NJ families, while raising costs for many more. Thankful this reckless proposal did not ultimately become law. We need to continue to fight #Trump sabotage of the #ACA. https://t.co/tsvd1ISRqM“Pallone is calling out the FDA for delaying a rule that will allow Juul to stay on the market until 2022 without review or regulation. Each of the pods used in a Juul is equivalent to about 200 puffs, or a pack of cigarettes.”
https://t.co/ls1Y5vkayMNot only did #GOP try to repeal the #ACA, they also spent the last year sabotaging the ACA and jeopardizing coverage for millions of Americans. I will continue to fight this reckless and extreme agenda. https://t.co/mopQW0E2HwI'm live on Facebook now answering questions. Join here:
https://t.co/FOKJcliC5mJoined @SenatorMenendez in #Edison to call on Congress to pass legislation lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Prescription drug prices are higher than ever and families are suffering. We need to act now. https://t.co/nyitaKPrqLElaine thank you for sharing that story. The cost of long-term care can be devastating for families. That’s why we need to take action. https://t.co/DPnXPYIfEu"The growing need for long-term care is one of the greatest threats to retirement security for American seniors, and the adult children who care for them,” Pallone said.
https://t.co/qostmpKivVThe lies &amp; the deception continue. More important than ever that we protect the integrity of the #Mueller investigation and prevent @realDonaldTrump from obstructing justice yet again.

It’s time to expand Medicare to include a long-term care benefit so that millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities no longer have to face financial ruin before they get assistance. https://t.co/XqYEydkJ6YPaid sick leave is a victory for NJ workers and NJ families. Congress should follow @GovMurphy’s lead.

https://t.co/WUlUNqpxOP#PollutingPruitt continues to mislead Congress and the American people. New reports show that the extent to which special interests provided him with gifts and subsequently sought specific favors from EPA in return is more pervasive than he led on.
https://t.co/Hret2Q1hOUTake a look at the submissions for my Congressional Art Competition. It’s clear we have a tremendous amount of talented artists right here in #Middlesex and #Monmouth counties. @CongressionalAC https://t.co/sPa3cukymZThanks to Trump and Congressional Republican’s relentless #ACASabotage, 4 million Americans lost coverage last year and the uninsured rate jumped to 15.5%.
https://t.co/alGOEIJjgPPruitt’s lies are stacking up, and Republicans continue to turn a blind eye. They’re complicit in his serious ethical lapses. #BootPruitt
