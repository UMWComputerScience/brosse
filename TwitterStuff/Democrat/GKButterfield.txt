This week marks 5 years since #SCOTUS issued its decision in Shelby County v. Holder. Since then, many states - including NC- have enacted restrictive voting laws. 

Today, we had an informative panel on the state of voting rights. Watch video here: https://t.co/4JabRmAKuw https://t.co/8v1V1ep8e8I’m pleased the GTAC is nearing completion!

Instead of trying to cut SNAP, Congress should be working to strengthen the program so many families rely on. https://t.co/gwQWfgj269 via @daily_dispatchRepublicans have a simple plan: pass the #GOPTaxScam (done) and then go after Medicare &amp; Medicaid.  All of which threaten our small hospitals and the communities they’re in.New report from @USCBO finds #GOPTaxScam tax giveaways to big corporations and the ultra-wealthy are driving huge federal debt, opening the door to Republican attacks on Social Security and Medicare.  https://t.co/8R0fCJ0uJkWith today’s 5-4 #SCOTUS decisions, we are reminded that our #CourtsMatter and that the appointment of ultra-conservative judges is already having a devastating impact on our rights. https://t.co/rV3bBcHHa1Our nation is better than this. I am deeply disappointed that this decision now gives the President legal authority to implement U.S. Government policy based on discrimination and division. https://t.co/8Hk1Jb1UdnIt’s been 5 years since #SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act. Since then, GOP politicians have tried to make it harder to register &amp; cast your ballot. Gerrymandering, voter ID, voter purges, and attacks on early voting are threats to our democracy. It’s time to #RestoreTheVOTE. https://t.co/N7R6VgVm89My prayers are with the family, friends, &amp; colleagues of Senior Police Officer Christopher Driver of the Rocky Mount Police Department.

I continue to call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act because we must #RestoretheVote.After the Court’s ruling in Shelby County v Holder, states across the country began enacting harsh voter suppression laws, including North Carolina’s passage of a voter suppression law less than two months after the Shelby County decision.It has been 5 years since #SCOTUS ruled in Shelby County v Holder. The decision was a major blow to voting rights in America, reversing 50 years of progress made to expand voting and dismantling advancements to ensure an equitable democracy. https://t.co/rHEk11UdcJThe Supreme Court is expected to decide as soon as Monday whether to take up a partisan gerrymandering case in North Carolina.  https://t.co/uPyPW5x4lb@Fitness_Tiya Hi Tina, I helped introduce the House companion to S. 3036- it's H.R. 6135.

Today, I called on @MickMulvaneyOMB to detail how @CFPB will protect minority consumers from discrimination &amp; abusive financial practices in the industry. https://t.co/FwiaWXIPJbAnother day, another shameful act by @HouseGOP. They just passed their partisan #FarmBill, which cuts $23 billion from food assistance for families in need. 

This fight isn’t over. Now we must work even harder to make sure this bad bill doesn’t become law.In NC, the impact of SNAP is huge. Over $2.2Bil in economic activity generated in 2017 alone. Cuts to those benefits would hurt NC’s economy. #ProtectSNAPTODAY in the House, Republicans are trying to pass their #FarmBill that cuts $23BIL from #SNAP.

SNAP is our most effective anti-hunger program, helping 1 in 8 Americans- mostly children, seniors, or people w disabilities- put food on the table. 

I’ll be voting NO on this bill.New voter suppression proposals echo North Carolina's dark past https://t.co/UW5bsiYHsi #ncpol via @ncpolicywatchNorth Carolinians will not stand for another assault our right to vote.

 https://t.co/GUrayb11mgThis is President Trump’s policy. If he wanted, he could end this cruel policy today. He could end it this hour. He could end it now.

#KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/2TEpxpcaRA@kbrock_wnc @NCDemParty Yes, it is the companion - H.R. 6135President Trump's family separation is inhumane and causes irreversible damage to children. That’s why I’m demanding an immediate hearing. We want answers from the Trump Administration. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/WmzT4t9isxToday, I joined more than 190 of my @HouseDemocrats colleagues to introduce the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to end family separation at the U.S. border as a result of the Admin's 'zero tolerance' policy. #KeepFamiliesTogether“The effect is catastrophic,” said Charles Nelson, a pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School. “There’s so much research on this that if people paid attention at all to the science, they would never do this.” https://t.co/kbUf04dFXSOn #Juneteenth2018, we commemorate when the news of emancipation finally reached slaves in the deepest parts of the Confederacy. It is just as important today as it was 153 years ago that we continue our work to ensure all Americans are treated fairly and equitably under the law. https://t.co/DCxl0tLA2HNominating Jeff Sessions to be AG was the first indication of the lack of respect this Administration would have for the protection of civil and constitutional rights. But the extremity of his agenda is still shocking.
 https://t.co/AQMUie2sgA#NC01 sent me to Congress to represent their values, and those don’t include separating families at the border. Today, I join my colleagues to introduce the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act in the House because we must take a stand to stop the Trump Administration’s inhumane policy.To learn more about receiving a military academy nomination from my office, visit: https://t.co/zNATHRFngXWhat an honor to meet with our #NC01 Military Academy Nominees yesterday afternoon. You all have a bright future ahead of you! https://t.co/4koHePvjuBTomorrow, I will join my colleagues to introduce the Keep Families Together Act in the House because separating children from their parents at the border must stop. The Trump Administration can change this harmful policy but since they won’t, Congress must take a stand. https://t.co/hZe1brCLhVToday alone, nearly 95% of the calls to my office were AGAINST the Trump Administration’s inhumane policy of separating families at the border.

This is an American issue that speaks to who we are as a nation. The Administration can and must reverse course now.While I am disappointed that the Supreme Court decided to put off a decision on the question of political gerrymandering. The issue of the constitutionality of extreme partisan gerrymandering is still very much alive. 

My full statement on today’s #SCOTUS decisions: https://t.co/UjCJhTBKRGBREAKING: Supreme Court sidesteps decision on partisan gerrymandering. https://t.co/3cM28e2SXiThe lies of President Trump and his administration are even being called out by members of his own party.

y quick take: When it comes to tech inclusion, there’s STILL no app for that. https://t.co/oj5zWG6nkVThank you and farewell to our Spring semester intern, Emoni! Emoni is from Durham and spent the semester in my Washington, DC office. On behalf of myself and #NC01, thank you for your hard work and dedication. Best wishes! https://t.co/7ILaholDz4The tech industry has created huge wealth and opportunity, but a growing number of communities and Black employees are being left out of the growth. #CBCTECH2020 went back to Silicon Valley last week to press the issue. Here’s what happened: https://t.co/oj5zWG6nkVNo argument here 👍 https://t.co/rmDKshaAv3After spending $2 Trillion on tax cuts for the super-wealthy, the Trump Administration wants to claim they care about debt by taking $15 Billion from critical programs like CHIP, a health insurance program for 9M kids...? 

Unreal. https://t.co/mXf8k97LYd.@Amazon’s employees want answers for the lack of Board diversity &amp; so do I. We must recognize the value of diversity in tech. This is why @RepBarbaraLee and I launched #CBCTECH2020 and visited Silicon Valley last week to press for Black inclusion at all levels of the industry..@Amazon’s board is 100% white and 70% male. A shareholder proposal asked Amazon to implement a new plan to ensure a diverse applicant pool for future board vacancies. The board voted against this proposal. 

It’s 2018.  This is unacceptable.
https://t.co/53PmXu8WIUPresident Trump’s decision is reckless and shortsighted, isolating the United States from its closest allies and damaging America’s credibility. https://t.co/oIAt5JT2m6Thank you for stopping by! https://t.co/zHFjmpEv0SMeet Ms. Kirtina Jones.

☑️ Pass a #TaxScam to hand massive tax cuts to super-wealthy
☑️Manufacture a crisis over the trillions in added debt they created
