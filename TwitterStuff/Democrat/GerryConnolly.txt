Don’t fall for this.

https://t.co/AhLnY5HrCCThat the administration is proposing a sweeping reorganization to improve programs that help vulnerable populations.

https://t.co/WXuB6EaNmHTrump retreats on child separation policy. A shameful chapter in his presidency.The President does not deserve an ounce of credit. He alone created this problem. He alone brought fear, pain and suffering onto these families. Details of this EO will matter. We cannot have families, especially children, indefinitely detained.To reiterate:

This Trump policy is cruel and morally repugnant.
It is a crisis the President created and one he can and must end NOW.
There is no law that forces children to be separated from their parents. That is fake news/alternative facts.

https://t.co/IwWnAgHhByBut among the most important lessons of this report “is the need for the Department and FBI leadership to follow its established procedures and policies even in its highest-profile and most challenging investigations.”President Trump and Congressional Republicans will no doubt continue their assault on Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation in the same way they attacked the FBI and Department of Justice throughout the Clinton email investigation.Rather “they were based on the prosecutors’ assessment of the facts, the law, and past Department practice.” This undermines the central tenets of their conspiracy and should silence their rabid attacks on the rule of law.This is not a good report for President Trump and the “Lock Her Up” crowd. The IG “found no evidence that the conclusions by Department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations.”There is no way around it. Former FBI Director Comey’s misconduct and profoundly bad judgment helped elect Donald Trump President of the United States. Inspector General Horowitz found that Mr. Comey’s actions violated FBI policy, practice, and protocol.

It was his inability to recognize and close a deal that led to a government shutdown. Now, the consequences could be a nuclear Iran and North Korea.Our allies and adversaries alike will not trust American leadership to negotiate another agreement whether on Iran or North Korea or elsewhere.

https://t.co/UMojnoma59The President’s damaging decision paves the way to an Iranian nuclear weapon and shatters U.S. credibility around the world.The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford reiterated that “Iran is not in material breach of the agreement, and I do believe the agreement to date has delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran.”The leaders of all parties to the Iran deal, including many members of Trump’s own administration, maintain that Iran is in compliance.The International Atomic Energy Agency has released ELEVEN verification and monitoring reports indicating that Iran has not violated the agreement, and the President has certified to Congress SIX times that Iran is in compliance.It has reduced its stockpile of enriched uranium to no more than 300 kilograms enriched no higher than 3.67 percent, and submitted to continuous monitoring and inspections at its key nuclear facilities.By every measure Iran is in compliance with the JCPOA. Iran has poured concrete into its plutonium reactor, reduced its centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104.With today’s unilateral retreat, the President is now responsible for the fallout of the Iran deal. All of our allies, including President Macron &amp; Chancellor Merkel, pointed out that the agreement is working and warned that it would be deeply destructive for the US to withdraw.Congratulations to Reston resident Matthew Nims for being named a finalist for the Service to America Medal. He &amp; his team distributed $1.4 billion in food assistance to 20 million people in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria who are fighting famine and other dangers. https://t.co/21yOjhWYxpHappy #TeacherAppreciationDay to all our dedicated @PWCSNews and @fcpsnews teachers. Thank you for your work in educating and inspiring our future young leaders.Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce urges Trump not to renounce Iran nuclear agreement but to build on it. He's right. The agreement is working. We cannot afford a nuclear Iran.Today’s Metro announcement is beyond distressing — it’s really a stunning reversal of commitments made to commuters and to leaders of the region. How do we go from “Back to Good” to “Back to Shutdown”? 

https://t.co/58hIQ53tAtThis is a terrible way to celebrate public service week. Shame on the Trump administration for conflating the two.

What is happening in Tysons is truly transformative. Together we are building America's City of the Future. https://t.co/mWsoclgYQ3I applaud Speaker Ryan's decision to accept Fr Pat Conroy's rescission to resign as Chaplain of the House. Now we can begin the healing process after this ugly, unwarranted incident.A shameful day for the Trump White House and the Press Secretary. Either you lied or they left you out of the loop. If the latter, why would you serve this President? How can we ever have confidence in this Administration’s press briefings?.@KpwbOrg is doing important environmental work in Prince William County. I enjoyed sitting down with Jason Parsons and Lynda Kummelt to discuss how we can Keep PW Beautiful.

https://t.co/3O0Xj7eqByThank you for sharing your voice @LangstonACarter! https://t.co/H20n3BeK52A constructive and respectful dialogue tonight. Many good ideas about how we can make our community safer. #TownHallForOurLives https://t.co/HnaxwNsya6Kicking off our student town hall on guns. Thanks to our NoVa young leaders for helping put this important conversation together. Now let's pass the ABCs.

-Reinstate the assault weapons ban 
-Pass background checks

#TownHallForOurLives https://t.co/UqhV8hMKnlPacked room at today's @RestonChamber 6th annual B2G Conference!

https://t.co/MaOR17Y3NHJust sent a letter to Speaker Ryan asking for an explanation, but it looks like he fired the chaplain for ministering to the poor by pointing out the Trump #taxscam helps the wealthiest who don’t need it.

https://t.co/XvCGkvyvvJ https://t.co/Yiow0jPBbII guess Speaker Ryan would fire Pope Francis too if he could.Ryan's explanation gives double-speak a bad name. https://t.co/772Wt8SDOoSpeaker Ryan fires House Chaplain? Is nothing sacred?I am shocked that Chairman Royce apparently believes that legitimate and substantive issues should never be debated and voted on during a mark-up of a major foreign policy bill. To him that's politicization. To me that's called the legislative process.Will be on @cspanwj to discuss N Korea and take your calls.Speaking to @MomsDemand Burke/Fairfax chapter this evening. The false interpretation of the 2nd Amendment peddled by the NRA cannot usurp our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We must bring back rational discourse on gun control. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/RcvmPuGzhcListen here to this morning’s Supreme Court case Trump v. Hawaii. That wasn’t so hard to provide same-day audio, now was it @SCOTUS? Now let’s get #CamerasIntheCourt! 

https://t.co/gZM0Fncm4oExcept for baguettes and wine I've never envied the French. Until today. Pres Macron gave the speech most Americans wish our own President could give. Inspirational, bold, a robust defense of democracy and a call to arms in its defense. Viva la FranceOn the Iran nuclear agreement Macron says build on it based on four pillars to get a more comprehensive accord. But build on it don't abandon it. Listening Donald?Macron says we have to deal with climate change because "there is no planet B." The earth is all we have. Listening Donald?Macron calls on US to meet the threats to democracy and freedom. The world counts on us. Fight for our values and against those who would destroy them. Avoid commercial wars and extreme nationalism and embrace science. Donald Trump are you listening?Pres. Macron offers eloquent defense of freedom and liberty in French-accented English at joint session of Congress. Quel dommage our own president cannot/will not do the same.Forget the kerfuffle about Dr Jackson's reported drinking habits and abusive management style. The issue is that he has no credentials to manage the VA and the millions of veterans it serves. Our veterans are not guinea pigs.A lot to discuss with @WolfBlitzer tonight. More Pruitt misdeeds, Trump's VA nominee is in trouble, and the President's jaw-dropping comment about Kim Jung Un. https://t.co/AVOLKqbDeAWill be on with @wolfblitzer to discuss today's headlines including Pruitt, N Korea.Enjoyed my annual lecture at UVA yesterday. Great discussion with great students. Thanks to @UVaBatten Professor @GerryWarburg for creating such an enlivened intellectual environment.It’s not shocking that WH didn’t vet VA nominee Jackson. This is a pattern of incompetence. Remember Porter and Flynn. And it was not even two months ago that 30 Trump staffers lost their Top Secret clearances.Since coming to Congress I've been fighting for strong federal #coalash standards and was proud to be recognized as a "Protector of the Potomac” Award. We cant let Pruitt threaten our local communities and waterways. #BootPruitt
#ProtectCleanWater 

https://t.co/RKBOirkiqLThis is an enormous gamble by a very unprepared president. This president we know doesn't read. He gets impatient in briefings, and he doesn't have a team in place to deal with North Korea. Other than that, what could go wrong? https://t.co/X8gt8jtyVL@john_sipher Great meeting you as well and I look forward to seeing you around Reston!Joining @AlexWitt to discuss Comey memos, Trump-North Korea, and Pompeo confirmation.Happy #earthday! Instead of denying climate change exists, Congress should lead and #ActOnClimate. As co-chair of @SEEC I'll continue to fight the Trump Administration's attacks on the EPA, science, the Clean Power Plan and Paris Agreement.Back in @CityofFairfaxVA for Spotlight on the Arts Festival kickoff!

https://t.co/UpMz03HT7gThe latest sanctions flap b/w WH &amp; Haley damages her credibility going forward and once again makes everyone, friend &amp; foe alike, wonder that when the US says something, approves something, calls for something, opposes something, is it for real? @nytimes

https://t.co/r43wso5HV6White House distancing itself from Cohen tonight - saying he was one of many lawyers. He was Trump's fixer.
