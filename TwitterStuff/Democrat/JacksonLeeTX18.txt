Specifically, sentencing reform." https://t.co/gNtPsNiVHF #RejectHR5682AG @EricHolder: 1st Step Act "abandons years of work and risks making it harder for Congress to advance more serious legislation in the future. Meaningful sentencing reform will be less likely to occur if the narrow prison bill is enacted." #RejectHR5682 https://t.co/R7SBL8HatW@EricHolder is right: it's impossible to right the wrong of mass incarceration "unless we send the right people to prison for appropriate lengths of time. That starts by making sure that federal prison sentences are smart on crime rather than thoughtlessly "tough." #RejectHR5682I agree with @nytimes that federal halfway houses are so underfunded that even inmates who are eligible for immediate release can't go anywhere, because there aren't enough beds available. #RejectHR5682 https://t.co/qGeQ4SYvIXTouring the devastation and meeting with survivors from the Corder Fire.

https://t.co/lVtEiqFcYE https://t.co/3AlxifhM46@EricHolder is right: [The First Step Act] abandons years of work and risks making it harder for Congress to advance more serious legislation in the future.  Meaningful sentencing reform will be less likely to occur if [this] narrow prison bill is enacted.  #RejectHR5682I agree with the @civilrightsorg - Advancing prison reform as a stand-alone bill, without sentencing reform, will undermine longstanding, bipartisan efforts in the Senate to advance a comprehensive justice reform package that includes sentencing reform.  #rejectHR5682I agree with @nytimes - the biggest problem with the First Step Act isn't what's in it, it's what's left out.  Specifically, sentencing reform.  #rejectHR5682@EricHolder is right: Mass Incarceration is a core civil rights struggle - 1 in 3 black men will be behind bars at some point.  Let's make sure that federal prison sentences are smart on crime rather than relentlessly tough,  #rejectHR5682I agree with @civilrightsorg: While well-intentioned #HR5682 is a misguided approach to reforming our justice system.  Decisions we make now through this bill could have deep implications for our ability to impact the systemic harms that lead to mass incarceration.  #rejectHR5682I agree with former AG @EricHolder - "the Trump administration is pushing a misguided legislative effort that threatens to derail momentum for sentencing reform.

Address #Alton's civil rights &amp; adhere to laws; confront cnt'd episodes of reactive violence twrds Black men by some law enforcement in the U.S.The track record of State takeovers of critical responsibilities vested in local institutions and local officials with direct community ties and deep knowledge of local conditions does not inspire confidence. Just ask the residents of Flint, Michigan.

https://t.co/QIP2PSHtueToday I called upon the Civil Rights Division of the USDOJ to investigate what appears to be an unwarranted use of lethal force that took the life of Danny Ray Thomas, of Houston, by an officer of the Harris County Sheriff's Department #thisstopstoday

https://t.co/nqmTMi3rpfPutin's choice to expel diplomats/close the U.S. consulate in St. P'burg is unfortunate - let's be resolved with our NATO allies against Russian geopolitical belligerence, show American values when our ideals are threatened and not venture any further down the path of appeasementAsking about citizenship reminds me of an uglier time in our history where questions about fair representation were informed by immutable characteristics, like race.  The stakes are too high for Congress to allow our decennial #2020Census to be sabotaged. https://t.co/Nga9t4Tumh https://t.co/z4tJydAtwzThe VA (377K employees &amp; $180 billion annual budget) has a sacred mission "to care for him who has borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan." It should be led by an experienced administrator. And it should not be privatized. @HouseDemocrats https://t.co/yRXl6icxwwMy op-ed: "Congress can and must take action to reduce gun violence by enacting two practical, effective, and popular measures: HR 5088, ‚ÄúNo More Atrocities with Guns Act‚Äù; and HR 4268, ‚ÄúGun Safety Not Sorry Act of 2017.‚Äù @HouseDemocrats @Everytown #NeverAgain @HouseJudDems https://t.co/mQibCXJf1tIncomprehensible statements about victims of gun violence, like those at #MSD literally staring down the barrel of AR-15s, must end. CPR can't stop an assault rifle - The students are right: we need real gun safety legislation; foolish talk w/o answers should end #enoughisenoughToday I called for congressional hearings on #FacebookDataBreach, for passage of HR 3654, my bill to protect SC's #TrumpRussiaInvestigation, and discussed the latest developments regarding U.S. policy towards Russia on @BloombergTV. https://t.co/k03RLMDJKe @HouseDemocratsI would like to extend my sympathy to the people of Russia and to the families of the dozens of people killed in the fire at Winter Cherry Mall in Siberia.  I wish that those not yet located will be found safe and sound, including the scores of children still missing.Happy Nowruz!  On this holiday celebrating hope and renewal, I extend to all in the Iranian-American community my best wishes for a happy, healthy and prosperous new year.  #NowruzSpkr Ryan and Ldr. McConnell, there's no excuse - bring gun safety legislation to a vote right now &amp; save lives - Millions demand that Congress act - Raise the age to 21 to buy a gun #H.R.5088 - Support a 7 day wait period #H.R.4268 - No more gun violence! #ikneel #enoughisenoughAt the #MarchForOurLives to #EndGunViolence with @JacksonLeeTX18 https://t.co/gjncDBErksCongresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee at Today's March for our Lives - "Dear NRA - Do Not Stand In Our Way - Enough is Enough"! https://t.co/hDteIqYWZv@JacksonLeeTX18 invited to join the #Marchforlives Houston and to speak at 9:45 AM today. The power today shown across the nation must empower saving lives and ending gun violence now. Republicans and the NRA must get out of the way. #khou11 #kprc2 #ktrk #kriv #kxln #ktmd #kiahTo all transgender persons who have worn, are or dream of wearing the the uniform to defend their country: Your love of country &amp; willingness to risk all to protect freedom is honored. I oppose @realDonaldTrump's action and will do all I can to #ProtectTransTroops from bigots.@JacksonLeeTX18 returning to Houston to #MarchForLife #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/5n07skrKsFI thank @Austin_Police @ATFHQ @FBIHouston and all law enforcement personnel for finding the serial bomber and ending the terror in #Austin.  I encourage all residents to remain vigilant and continue to report all suspicious packages to the police.It‚Äôs been 8 years after the ACA and it is continuing to prove to be a crucial tool for helping Americans seek mental health treatment. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/CNmuRC10bbThere is only one common denominator across the gun violence epidemic in America - guns. 
Attempting to approach this problem without addressing, or even acknowledging, that fact is missing the point. 

#NeverAgain #EndGunViolence https://t.co/kp0lyaQdPuMuch congratulations to Pakistani Americans on Republic Day! #mj_khan #muslimyouthusa #isgh.orgTrumps veto position is ridiculous, because his own Republican leadership in the House and Senate will not put a clean bipartisan DACA bill or my comprehensive immigration reform bill that provides access to citizenship for everybody on the floor of either the House or the SenateRepublicans and Trump have done nothing but deport DACA recipients and their families.  Trump if you have a fair plan for DACA, send it to the Hill now! #DACADreamers #uneteafiel #dacaPresident Trump is threatening a ridiculous veto over the 800,000 DACA recipients.  When he created this crisis and threw them all over the wall, Democrats have been standing with DACA recipients protesting and fighting. #uneteafiel #DACADreamersJohn #Bolton supports preemptive strike on North Korea, disavowing the Iran Nuclear Deal, and regime change in Iran. Recalls to mind Talleyrand who said of the French Bourbons: ‚ÄúThey had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.‚Äù https://t.co/3zcoaOOo9zWe already tried "regime change" and "preemptive war" during the George W. Bush years and have ever since been living with the disastrous consequences, which includes the @realDonaldTrump Administration nightmare. Why would anyone want to go back to that? https://t.co/3zcoaOOo9zToday I discussed at length Russia's attack on America, the lack of credible responses by @realDonaldTrump to sanction and deter Russia, and actions by Trumpsters to undermine the SC's Russia investigation. #TrumpRussia @HouseDemocrats  https://t.co/GcTyOGcliV @HouseJudDemsToday the House passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act providing funding to sustain federal government operations through September 30, 2018, the end of the fiscal year. Here I discuss the merits and drawbacks of the legislation. https://t.co/xrr5mjHqKf @HouseDemocratsCongresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is pleased to note that the elevator at Primrose Apts is repaired and because of that, a serious threat to public safety is eradicated.   Residents may now live without fear that a broken elevator could impede first responders from helping them.Proud to have joined with @OfficialCBC colleagues to recognize the contributions of African American women at tonight's CBC #WomensHistoryMonth Special Order. https://t.co/PIpAjljhC6 @HouseDemocrats #BlackGirlMagicHaving interviewed Andrew McCabe at a closed door Judiciary Committee Hearing, I am unpersuaded that the drastic action taken against was warranted and it appears to be excessive and likely vindictive. #McCabeFired @HouseJudDems @HouseDemocratsStatement of Andrew McCabe: 

"Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey."

https://t.co/8sIfkI6bLO @HouseDemocratsI am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend, Congresswoman #LouiseSlaughter Slaughter, a trailblazer for women and a true public servant. New York and our nation have lost a champion for justice, women, and the arts. The world's women have lost a powerful voice. @HouseDemocrats https://t.co/BJUXvgpH4IIt was my privilege and honor to serve with Congresswoman #LouiseSlaughter for the past 23 years. I will miss Louise dearly. @HouseDemocrats https://t.co/536CUtpmwy
