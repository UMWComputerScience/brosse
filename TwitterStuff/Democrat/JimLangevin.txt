Congratulations to Mayor @Jorge_Elorza and @Steph_Gonzalez_ on the birth of your baby boy! https://t.co/rpRPCMOSNwIt’s absolutely shameful that thousands of families remain separated. We must keep pressing this issue until every last child is reunited with their parents, which is why I joined my colleagues on @HomelandDems in demanding answers from @SecNielsen. #FamiliesBelongTogetherIt was an honor to meet with His Majesty @KingAbdullahII this week. https://t.co/tgQ7epYP9XYear after year, the @Wickfordart Festival reminds us that some of the most talented artists reside right here in the Ocean State. Best of luck to this year’s participants!The @GrodenNetwork has been a leader for decades in supporting Rhode Islanders with developmental disabilities.

Congratulations to @Warwick_RI’s Connor Devine who was named a #CarnegieHero for his bravery and heroism in a frightening situation. https://t.co/nRWOyehhcSAppalled that the #Gorsuch Court is now going after civil servants by overturning four decades of precedent and undermining their rights as employees. Governments are not infringing on free speech by allowing workers to demand better wages. #JanusPleased to see the Senate HELP Committee advance a bipartisan #PerkinsCTE Act reauthorization! This important update will go a long way toward closing the #skillsgap.Last night, I was pleased to speak in support of @RepDonBacon’s bill to authorize @ICSCERT.

Thanks for stopping by to brief me on your admirable work. #SADD18 https://t.co/RwCopt4UqgThe right to vote is central to the integrity of our democracy. However, that right is currently threatened by gerrymandering, voter purges and more. I’ve cosponsored the Voting Rights Advancement Act so we can #RestoreTheVOTEThe @FCC repealed #NetNeutrality. I’m supporting legislation that will bring it back so everyone has access to a free and open Internet. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/J7KL3aNbJtHappy National #LGBTEqualityDay! As we recognize the historic #SCOTUS rulings for the LGBT community, we also remember there is still more work to be done in the fight for full equality. #Pride2018 https://t.co/s6syYqqNRDDeeply disappointed in the Supreme Court #TravelBan ruling today. As made clear during my questions of then Secretary Kelly, there is no specific intelligence backing this ban, and it can only be viewed as an expression of the President’s ill will toward Muslims.On Friday, I introduced legislation w/ @BennieGThompson @RepPeteKing to improve emergency preparedness and response planning for people with #disabilities and ensure they have a seat at the table. https://t.co/LJDHukAPdN https://t.co/3oifQ7NUnZBest wishes to the @RIStatePolice, @RINationalGuard, and @CyberScout for a successful RI Joint Cyber Task Force meeting today.

Here is my full statement: https://t.co/ROxeOdTDFh https://t.co/IJbBFlg9pfI’m proud to support the @NOH8Campaign – everyone deserves the same rights and respect regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. #Pride2018 https://t.co/OZujnEk7lDThe President’s decision to revoke the #NationalOceanPolicy is deeply misguided and rejects years of bipartisan work to improve the health of ocean and coastal ecosystems. Rather than focus on short-term resource extraction, we need to preserve our oceans for future generations.It’s #NationalSelfieDay, and what better way to commemorate the occasion than with this #TBT selfie with my buddy @SenWhitehouse! https://t.co/oETYEvhsuOOn the #LongestDay, our thoughts are with those living with Alzheimer’s disease and their caregivers. Thank you to the @alzassociation @alzassocri and everyone working to #EndALZ https://t.co/XwBfUPx6hgThe President admitted the inhumanity of his family separation policy, yet he did not present a real solution nor mention the thousands of kids who have already been torn from their parents. How will we reunite these families if DHS doesn’t know where they are? #WhereAreTheGirls?Last night, I spoke on the House floor to recognize LGBT #PrideMonth. Let’s keep celebrating our differences and promoting a culture of acceptance. #Pride2018 https://t.co/qD7L5LM6frThis is a crisis of the President’s own making, and he can stop it immediately by ending his “zero tolerance policy” of jailing families fleeing for their lives.I’m glad the President recognized his family separation policy is inhumane, but this executive order is no solution at all. We don’t want three year-olds separated from their mothers, but we don’t want them in jail either.Thanks @RITELL_ESL Executive Director Flavia Baker for stopping by and for your hard work to support English language learners in Rhode Island. #ELT https://t.co/zNX26bPo6ySorry to miss the ribbon cutting for the new @Hyatt Place Warwick hotel this morning. Great to see @Warwick_RI City Centre continuing to grow!Enjoyed meeting with my counterparts in the @KnessetIL yesterday to talk #cybersecurity and ways to further strengthen the US-Israel relationship. https://t.co/nyR18xE1o0Implementing #Medicaid electronic visit verification without true stakeholder engagement would create real challenges for our #seniors and people with #disabilities. Glad to see the bill I introduced with @RepGuthrie and @RepDianaDeGette to delay implementation passed the House. https://t.co/H9CAH3uqnfChildren should not be ripped from the arms of their parents. It’s time for the President to take responsibility and stop the separation of families at our border. #KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogetherRI has the ninth highest rate of opioid-related deaths in the country. Proud that my legislation w/ @RepPeteKing to help prevent these substances from coming into our communities passed the House yesterday.  

https://t.co/kiKokRLZP6 https://t.co/L7lbyDs5YJThis very minute terrified children are crying in cages at our border and the President refuses to do anything to stop it. It’s time to end this policy and turn the page on one of the saddest chapters in American history. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/TeLgWXQmXQHeaded to the House floor to debate the bill I introduced with @RepPeteKing to combat fentanyl trafficking. The opioid overdose crisis is tearing at the fabric of RI communities, and #HR5762 will ensure these drugs are caught before they reach our streets. https://t.co/NrmqxEGtmM#Alzheimers disease affects millions of Americans and their families. Thanks @alzassocri for stopping by the office today to share your stories and for your continued advocacy. #EndALZ https://t.co/9gZY2TaWzBI am proud to cosponsor the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act that will halt this terrible practice. While the President could change his policy with a simple phone call, he refuses to do so. As such, we must pass this legislation to end the humanitarian crisis he has created.The President’s policy of separating families - and make no mistake, it’s his policy – is utterly cruel and inhumane. Ripping crying children from their parents’ arms and keeping them in cages like animals is morally reprehensible and he must end this policy immediately.Great meeting with representatives from @PanCAN @PanCANRI to discuss their efforts to advance research and support patients with #pancreaticcaner. #PANCaware https://t.co/5TFEB1ycOBIt was a pleasure to speak @TESOL_Assn’s annual Advocacy and Policy Summit.

Today’s announcement is a crisis of the President’s own making, and he should reconsider and rejoin the JCPOA before our national security is further damaged.Walking away from the JCPOA abandons our allies, weakens our credibility, and harms our ability to foster similar diplomatic agreements in the future. Worse, it undermines the central goal of the agreement - to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Once again, the President is threatening U.S. national security and international stability. The Iran nuclear deal provides for comprehensive monitoring by the international community, and there remains no evidence that Iran is violating its commitments.So many educators have had a profound impact on my life, like my 6th grade teacher, Lizbeth Larkin. On National Teacher Day, let’s celebrate educators across America who enrich students’ lives every day, helping them learn, grow, and thrive at every stage of life. #ThankATeacherYesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting Susan Shaw, a talented local artist from Richmond whose work was featured on the Wood Pawcatuck Watershed Asssociation’s Wild and Scenic poster. https://t.co/gjShLw0aDhI championed the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Protection Act.
