1. How will we verify those unaccompanied migrant children will be reunited with their parents?
2. When will this reunification take place?
3. Will children be held there beyond 20 days?

It would not have been necessary but for Trump’s policy.The Tornillo tent city costs about $400,000 per day to operate.The children only get 2 ten minute phone calls with a parent/relative per week! It takes me longer than that to pay my phone bill by phone. They should get more time.We will demand a full list from the Trump administration with the name of each child and his/her parent who were separated so that we can go through and make sure that each is reunited. Myself, @RepBetoORourke and others will work on that this week. Full accountability.Seven girls arrived in Tornillo this morning. Ages 13-17. Many have already parents that are in the US or have been deported. The rest are boys. 23 children total are considered separated from their parents. 2/My update on Tornillo inspection: Still no straight answer on where the girls are being kept. The answer always seems to be that someone else has the answer to that question. All agencies never in the room at same time to give full answers.Just about to arrive at the tent city holding migrant children in #Tornillo, Texas, outside of El Paso..@RepBetoORourke and I will inspect the tent camp holding children in Tornillo on Saturday afternoon. We believe: No family separation. No indefinite detention. No kids in cages.At least 2,300 children were separated from their parents from April through June. 

@POTUS: how do you plan on reuniting them now that you’ve signed your executive order that supposedly will end this policy? #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/hLXhRyx2lNThis jacket, the misspelled tweets (covfefe) and similar tactics are purposefully concocted to redirect our attention (esp. the media’s) from harmful stories to Trump. She wore it to dominate the news cycle and squeeze out stories of kids in cages being kept from their parents. https://t.co/hxAlVfeapxThese facilities are not suitable for any children, especially children forcibly separated from their parents because of President Trump's brutal policy. The federal government should not be funding any facilities with history of abuse to minors. https://t.co/FArsz9ZqeCReports of abuse—including forcibly injecting drugs into children—are disgusting. 

@POTUS signed an Executive Order because of YOUR voice. Let’s continue to voice our opposition to the zero-tolerance immigration policy that’s allowing this to happen. https://t.co/9ndMKsnIGt.@HouseGOP say the #GOPFarmBill doesn’t cut #SNAP.

Munchhausen’s Syndrome.We need a way to verify that separated children are reunited with their families. #KeepFamiliesTogetherBecause of you President Trump has signed an executive order to end family separation, but we must VERIFY this change in practice. Also, get rid of the cages and indefinite detention. Treat people like human beings. #KeepFamiliesTogetherSeparating children from their parents only to be placed in tents will leave a lasting psychological footprint on those affected. 

@realDonaldTrump: If you want to continue this policy, why don’t you see the facilities for yourself? #KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogetherThis is a stain on the moral conscious of America &amp; the President is pursuing a zero-tolerance immigration policy in the name of the American people. We must use our voice, and power, to bring us back to conscious and constitution. #KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogetherBut instead, @POTUS falsely blames @HouseDemocrats for creating these “loopholes” in the first place &amp; is using this as leverage to fund a #BorderWall. #KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogether (2/2)The President has the power to change his brutal zero-tolerance policy that is separating immigrant children from their families and holding them in spartan conditions across our nation. (1/2)This bill will put an end to the abhorrent practice of separating children from their parents.

Separating children from migrant families entering the US violates international law and should be stopped immediately. The United States should be a leader in human rights, not an offender. https://t.co/DuBmUChjtkImmigrants are our nation’s doctors, educators, businessmen and women, athletes and so much more. We must #CelebrateImmigrants and the meaningful contributions they make to our nation.  #ImmigrantHeritageMonthThe majority of Americans have an #immigrant story. Whether your family came to this country last year or more than a century ago, we share an immigrant heritage that has helped shape who we are. #ImmigrantHeritageMonth https://t.co/zuNvcstyQoHappening now: Press conference with @repjoecrowley, @RepRaulGrijalva and @HouseDemocrats calling on the Trump Administration to end the cruel practice of separating families.

We must hold our government accountable for policies that are inconsistent with our values and #KeepFamiliesTogetherAny attempt to influence witness testimony indicates where there’s smoke, there’s fire.

Why? I’ll draft legislation to change this. https://t.co/2vV45yBnyAThanks @SenJeffMerkley for taking action to protect children separated from their parents.
