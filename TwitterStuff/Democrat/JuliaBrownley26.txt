This truly transformative bill opened the doors of opportunity for a new generation of vets to further their education after service. In Congress, I will continue to work to ensure every vet has access to these critical benefits.The deeply disappointing #SCOTUS #Janus decision against organized labor will further weaken the middle class. That’s bad for everyone.People often forget that unions have been—and continue to be—cornerstone of strong middle class, which is critical for strong democracy. Ventura County’s middle-class workers, including teachers/nurses/firefighters/police officers, deserve strong representation fighting for them. https://t.co/9Cj9mg7sxKPleased to announce over $1.3 million for three affordable housing projects in Ventura County.

Health Subcommittee, I participated in hearing today to discuss VA’s efforts to recruit, hire &amp; retain quality staff. With empty executive suite &amp; thousands of vacancies, it's imperative that we address this #VacantVA. https://t.co/rMYfh517sPWe must #ProtectOurCare from the Trump administration’s cruel attempts to roll back protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. Read the story of Cindy from Newbury Park to see how these protections helped save her daughter’s life: https://t.co/vUsoyvXyZuI'm happy to announce more than $12.3M in federal funding for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects at Channel Islands Harbor, Ventura Harbor &amp; Port of Hueneme. This funding will help keep them open for business — good for our residents &amp; businesses alike. https://t.co/aBFYEvbrs4The President needs to prioritize appointing leaders to these key positions so that the Senate can do its job and our veterans can have the leadership at the VA they deserve.I am particularly concerned about the lack of leadership at the VA, where he has yet to formally submit his latest Secretary nominee to the Senate and has not even announced an Under Secretary for Health nominee. #VacantVAThere has been an unprecedented number of key positions left unfilled by the Trump administration, many of which he hasn’t even sent to the Senate for consideration. https://t.co/yNUrsWWyiZ https://t.co/StWtOojTrOI agree with @USChamber’s Tom Donohue — we must stop separating families at border immediately. Americans from every corner are saying this policy is wrong. @realDonaldTrump, it's time to stand up for our core values &amp; end this now. https://t.co/1Jj6KjyRu542,500 people a day — including many children — are forced to flee their homes because of conflict &amp; persecution.

These students are some of the best &amp; brightest Ventura County has to offer. I know they will represent us well. https://t.co/wccZn23XGVMore details available here: https://t.co/VmpJJWf7FWAttention property owners/designers/contractors: If you lost structure during #ThomasFire or are planning to work on reconstruction, Ventura County is hosting series of forums to learn about building permit process, including expedited process for those impacted by the fire.On #Juneteenth, we celebrate abolition of slavery in the U.S. We also come together to recognize that there is a lot more work to be done to end racial &amp; economic injustice in this country. In Congress, I will continue the fight for these values &amp; honor those who paved the way. https://t.co/Q2g2xs0MGEThat is why I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, which would prevent DHS from separating these children from their parents at the border. Know that I will keep fighting in Congress to put an end to this barbaric policy. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWe must do everything in our power to #KeepFamiliesTogether and end the immoral Trump administration policy that is causing families to be torn apart at our borders.To those who try to tear us apart with bigotry and hatred: Diversity is what made this country strong, and love and kindness for our fellow man will keep it that way.Together, we must reject the vitriolic and divisive rhetoric that has permeated our public debate and is fueling acts of violence seeking to divide our country and instill fear in our friends and neighbors.I am deeply concerned and disturbed by the marked rise in hate crimes that we have seen across the country recently, including right here in our own community. https://t.co/W6vMXc67yaThank you, Laura Bush, for speaking out about this cruel and heartless policy. We will keep fighting to end this inhumane and un-American policy that President Trump chose to put in place. https://t.co/LEdi8oScyTBecause of #GOPTaxScam, many Ventura County families will be paying more in taxes so the richest 1% can reap 83% of the rewards. We need to go back to the drawing board &amp; pass real bipartisan tax reform that helps working families in Ventura County, not wealthy special interests. https://t.co/PbCbdSIAd5On #FathersDay, and everyday, #FamiliesBelongTogether. President Trump’s policy of imprisoning refugees, who are lawfully applying for asylum, and heartlessly taking children from parents is incredibly cruel.

Here's an overview of all the promises he has failed to keep: https://t.co/toJ9OQC7QlHad a great time last night at the #CongressionalBaseballGame, celebrating bipartisanship and raising money for some good causes! https://t.co/Cep9SvHPo1How can the VA best serve our veterans without nearly a dozen key leaders in place? Yesterday, I spoke on House floor to demand that the President prioritize identifying, properly vetting &amp; appointing the leaders the VA needs – because this #VacantVA is an insult to our heroes. https://t.co/dOhIBduyd1Happy birthday, @USArmy! Without service and sacrifice of Army personnel throughout history, we would not enjoy the freedoms we have today. Thank you to brave men &amp; women who have or are currently serving our nation. https://t.co/y4Xf0L2yD0We need serious leadership at VA to ensure it has pipeline of providers entering VA &amp; staff to ensure they are on-boarded in timely manner. I look forward to continuing to work w/ my colleagues, VA &amp; VSOs to ensure VA is able to provide the best service possible to our veterans.The VA has more than 30,000 vacancies nationwide, which is deeply concerning and has resulted in longer waits for VA care. The dearth of leadership at the top – a direct result of President Trump’s failure to nominate qualified individuals – is only exacerbating this problem.Yesterday, I participated in @HouseVetAffairs @VetAffairsDems hearing to discuss bills, including to improve VA’s HR department &amp; pre-medical school training programs. https://t.co/xvbEvAE1b4On #FlagDay, we take a moment to commemorate the 241st anniversary of the adoption of the U.S. Flag and to honor all that it stands for. https://t.co/9t695joO0pI'm proud to join 140 of my colleagues to introduce House Resolution to condemn Trump admin’s inhumane policy that's separating children from parents at border. I'll continue to fight against this immoral policy because #FamiliesBelongTogether.Seeking refuge is a human right.

It's also time to recognize members of LGBTQ community who fought for equality &amp; justice ⬇️ https://t.co/2wbnevxWupIn Congress, I will continue to fight to see this bill become law and ensure survivors of domestic abuse are protected under the law.For these same reasons, I introduced the “Protect Victims of Crime Act” to expand the U visa program for survivors of serious crimes, which will strengthen law enforcement’s ability to go after criminals and protect survivors from future abuse.Victims of domestic violence, predominantly women, who come from countries where the perpetrator is not investigated, charged or jailed, should be protected, not returned for more abuse.Attorney General Jeff Sessions is absolutely wrong – federal law specifically provides for U visas for individuals who are escaping domestic violence. Because that is who we are as a nation. Jeff Sessions does not reflect our values, and he refuses to uphold our laws. https://t.co/GM82ESKPCENow more than ever, Congress needs to pass legislation to lay down permanent rules of the road for industry, while ensuring net neutrality continues to protect free speech, promote innovation, and advance civil rights.Yesterday, the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality went into effect, but the fight for a free and open internet continues. https://t.co/6FMeoAXvTnThe Trump administration is (once again) coming after protections for Americans w/ pre-existing conditions – including more than 16M Californians.

We owe our children and grandchildren so much more.Now the House GOP is pretending to care about a balanced budget again, demanding passage of a constitutional amendment that would make huge cuts to Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, and more.Last year, the House GOP took us backward with their tax plan – increasing the debt by trillions to reward corporate outsourcing and the wealthiest 1%.It’s clear we need to reduce our debt and deficit – which is why I voted in 2013 and 2015 for two-year bipartisan budget agreements that made hard choices but moved us forward with real progress on getting our fiscal house in order.@kenleyneufeld All high school students, including home schooled students, are welcome to attend. They will need to RSVP and bring a release form signed by their parent/guardian, which is available here: https://t.co/b2D9v0RgMYWhile this was a significant step forward, there is much more that we need to do. As your representative, I will continue to fight for federal policies that help ensure our students are prepared for the 21st Century economy and have the tools to reach their full potential.This week, 53 yrs. ago, landmark Elementary &amp; Secondary Education Act was signed into law. This critical piece of legislation changed public education by providing federal funds to help ensure every student, no matter economic background, has access to educational opportunities.On #HolocaustRemembranceDay #WeRemember &amp; honor the survivors &amp; victims of this horrific genocide &amp; join together to say never again. The fight against hatred &amp; discrimination continues today &amp; we must remain ever vigilant against any attempts to marginalize our fellow man. https://t.co/arQBzuOf4GI am pleased to see my legislation move forward today, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get it passed in the House.

The southwest border region has unique challenges in terms of goods movement and economic development.Impeding an investigation because the President doesn’t like that he’s being investigated is the very definition of obstruction.That is why I have joined many of my colleagues in signing a ‘discharge petition’ to allow the House to proceed even as Speaker Ryan stalls. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is also moving forward with a bill to protect the Mueller investigation.For months, many Members of Congress have urged Speaker Ryan to allow a vote on legislation to prevent such interference. Unfortunately, Speaker Ryan has prevented the legislation from getting a vote.It is critical that Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation continues without interference from the White House or Congress.Students will be required to bring their school ID and a release form signed by their parent/guardian to enter the event.

This historic legislation created protections for everyone – from families with children and people with disabilities, to those who are discriminated against based on gender, race, and ethnicity. #FHAct50Couldn't agree more with @SenatorTester - we need to hire more healthcare providers at the VA and ensure veterans have the care they need https://t.co/KAdDwRtujFReminder: Tax Day is Tuesday, April 17!

We owe our children and grandchildren #ABetterDeal!In 2013 and 2015, I voted for two-year bipartisan budgets that made hard choices, but that actually reduced our debt and deficits.

This project is especially important to me because it will include housing units designated for veterans who are homeless in our area.Last week, I was so pleased to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony for Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation’s newest affordable housing development, Phase II of the Snapdragon Place Apartments. https://t.co/NPqCmoRVPvCongratulations, @SenDuckworth, on the birth of your daughter - wishing you and your family health and happiness.

I urge President Trump to reverse his discriminatory immigration policies and welcome refugees that have been thoroughly vetted by our national security agencies.While the political and military situations are complex, one thing is abundantly clear: The United States cannot turn a blind eye to the millions of Syrian refugees seeking humanitarian assistance and a new home, safe from conflict.The U.S. needs a clear &amp; consistent policy when it comes to dealing with Syrian President Assad, who is a war criminal and must be brought to justice. However, President Trump should consult with our allies &amp; with Congress before committing any more U.S. troops in this conflict.Do you know a student interested in attending a U.S. service academy?

Today, we honor his legacy and recognize that it is on us to carry the torch of progress forward once again.As we reflect on the five decades since he was assassinated, we must confront the reality that while much progress has been made, we are still far from achieving the dream Dr. King had for our country and all of its people.On this day, 50 years ago, we lost a leader, a visionary, and a tireless advocate for peace: Martin Luther King, Jr. #MLK50 #MLK50Forward https://t.co/6g9kxPU5fcHis decision is not only bad for our economy, but also our health, increasing air pollution for generations to come.
