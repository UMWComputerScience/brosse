Congratulations @VSUTrojans!
https://t.co/d73WW8vmnfGOOD NEWS for our national parks. After months of negotiations with the Administration and my Republican colleagues, I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan consensus bill to finally address our massive national parks maintenance backlog. https://t.co/KN1eTpHrBBThis is 100% false. https://t.co/BFyYXu3zQkMake no mistake: the President just gave Russia the green light to once again interfere in US Elections.This is dangerous, this is weak, and it’s yet another slap in the face to the intelligence professionals who quite literally risk their lives to gather this kind of intelligence.But no, here we are less than a month away from a Presidential summit with Vladimir Putin, and the President is openly taking Putin’s word over our own intelligence community.For a while it even seemed like the President had gotten the message.
https://t.co/dNHxMtaWSWSo does the entire Senate Intel Committee, Republicans and Democrats alike.
https://t.co/FFA5XT0nTZReminder: our entire IC leadership stands by that conclusion. https://t.co/S6NokQT8htThe President can either believe the unanimous conclusion of our intelligence community, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/LLak67wbuhThe President can either believe his Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/b6F4hQi2F2The President can either believe his NSA Director and head of US Cyber Command General Nakasone, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/DR1tImRfjyThe President can either believe his FBI Director Chris Wray, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/s26c4Q0N5kThe President can either believe his Secretary of State and former CIA Director Mike Pompeo, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/4HGSNgIrdpThe President can either believe his Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/N7DasNkWBRAnd they’re lying. The President can either believe Russia or he can believe our country’s intel chiefs, generals, cabinet secretaries, and diplomats who’ve all said the same thing: Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and they’ll be back in 2018. https://t.co/qny9WIyJkbI am grateful to Justice Kennedy for his many decades of service to our country, and wish him all the best in his retirement.In just four months, the American people will determine the makeup of the United States Senate. Given the precedent set by Leader McConnell in 2016, it is only appropriate that the Senate wait until the new Congress is seated to consider any nomination to the Supreme Court.Unless the President holds Putin accountable for:
 
- 2016 election interference
- Undermining European democracies
- The UK chemical attack
- Invading Crimea
- Arming Ukrainian separatists
- Supporting Assad’s war crimes
 
This will just be another photo-op with a dictator. https://t.co/KV7rayAxKjAfter visiting one of the ‘better’ detention facilities, all I can say is we need a lot more compassion for these kids. We need to reunite these families now, then come back to the negotiating table and work on real, bipartisan immigration reform so this can never happen again.We’ve heard a lot of denials, a lot of counterattacks and blame shifting from this Administration, but we haven’t heard a lot by way of compassion for these children.What this facility cannot do is reunite them with their parents. That’s the responsibility of the Trump Administration, which created this mess.But no matter how well they’re being treated by the staff, the fact remains that they’re being held in detention, separated from their parents, because of this Administration. Housing them in the Ritz wouldn’t make that better.I’ve known this facility for a long time, I’ve visited before, and according to the kids I spoke to, they’re being treated well there.This morning I visited an HHS detention facility in Bristow, VA, where a number of immigrant minors are being held, 15 of whom were separated from their parents at the border. Some thoughts: https://t.co/82BNUd4NeIBy now you might have heard the reports of immigrant kids allegedly abused at a detention center in Staunton, Va. HHS Secretary Azar is responsible for overseeing that facility and I pressed him for answers.
https://t.co/aVruXLanAFIt’s official: the Republican tax bill is blowing up our national debt, bigly. https://t.co/QouFnDhuEpZTE is a national security threat, not a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. Our intelligence community knows it, our military knows it, and by now our President should know it too. Today @MarcoRubio and I called on the President to reverse course on the bad deal with ZTE. https://t.co/u9UyWs8lmdWhile I disagree with the Court, today’s decision does not make the President’s actions or statements related to the travel ban moral or just. We need to fight religious discrimination at every turn. Congress should take action to reverse the Trump travel ban.Three years ago today #MarriageEquality became the law of the land. #LoveIsLove https://t.co/i0uNuHkcrIGreat drawing, Sarah! Can’t wait to see this young Virginian’s @Google doodle on the homepage.
https://t.co/OOyzvkuOkXSomething strange is happening. Federal workers hit by the OPM hack — according to all public reports a Chinese espionage operation — are getting their identities stolen and we don’t know why or how. I’m pressing OPM and the Justice Department for answers. https://t.co/Ygkh8mOEYNWith a motion by George Mason, seconded by Patrick Henry, and a vote of 89-79, Virginia became the 10th state admitted to the Union 230 years ago today. Happy Statehood Day Virginia! https://t.co/FpJsLiLL6sThis isn’t over until every last family is reunited.
https://t.co/nIX0YSbg4DCongratulations to the @LittleLobbyists on one year of fighting for our nation’s youngest and most vulnerable #Medicaid patients. Keep up the fight. You give the rest of us hope. https://t.co/InWxT7qcmLGreat conversation on cybersecurity and security clearance reform with @NoVATechCouncil today at @GWTweets Loudoun Campus. https://t.co/34An8FUkzf.@TimKaine and I are demanding answers about what’s going on at this facility in Staunton. https://t.co/KJNKHVzx05Great seeing advocates from @AlzAssociation. They’re fighting for the 140,000 Virginians with Alzheimer’s and thousands of families, like mine, who have been impacted by this disease. Together we’re going to keep fighting to #EndALZ https://t.co/Rum0IaXeDAWe need to see these kids, and we need answers about what's going on at this facility. https://t.co/LNpOxusQGcNever forget how many of us are Americans because our ancestors came fleeing war, famine, religious persecution &amp; other hardships. They believed America was where they could build a better life for their families. It will be a sad day when that’s no longer true. #WorldRefugeeDayMore people should be paying attention to this. https://t.co/YnyGwU5notAmen @MarkHerringVA. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/7zChlsMNwsThis is child abuse.
https://t.co/3RaY3WqbjP.@TimKaine and I are demanding answers about the Trump Administration’s #FamilySeparation policy. We’ve signed on to legislation to end this cruel practice, and we’re not going to let up until this ends. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/gdZ2b9QPFjGreat hearing from SecDef Mattis at today’s Senate India Caucus meeting – important insights on the vital role of the US-India relationship to our national security in the Pacific region and at home. https://t.co/BqogvKNRkBAmen @GovernorVA. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/Ep0ZX5RGR8#Juneteenth commemorates the day of freedom for thousands of enslaved African-Americans. Today it’s a day to celebrate freedom and equality, and it’s a reminder we have more work to do to achieve those ideals in the lives of many black Americans. https://t.co/NwcmPBodnJ#FamilySeparation is not “the law.” It’s not “the Democrats fault.” It is the direct result of this DOJ order, signed by AG Sessions in April, implemented by the Trump Administration. These are facts. https://t.co/EqwJiBtbsDTonight the Senate passed our bipartisan amendment to block the Trump Administration's bad deal with ZTE. If the President won't act on warnings from his own top intelligence officials about the dangers posed by ZTE, we will.This is just heartbreaking. End #FamilySeparation now.
https://t.co/i15e5LIggLCorrect.
https://t.co/2wHikJPU39Facts matter. Alliances matter. The way the President of the United States conducts himself on the world stage matters. https://t.co/V1qTaUhessAnd currently, everyone else is arguing that the Trump Administration’s #FamilySeparation policy:
- Is cruel
- Is immoral
- Should end immediately https://t.co/NIkAnX9Eeu“Callous” — adjective — showing or having an insensitive and cruel disregard for others. https://t.co/OWdvu9JtsGOpioid overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death in Virginia, surpassing car accidents and gun violence. Glad my bills were included in the bipartisan Senate opioid package. Let's get this passed. https://t.co/Kqilwfz4EjAnother reason the President's trade war is a terrible idea: it's going to raise the price of cans for Virginia's breweries. Raised a glass with #RVA brewers to smart trade and a decently priced pint at @Hardywood. https://t.co/ajJvuGkqcVWe shouldn't be trying to balance the budget on the backs of federal workers. Targeting public servants might seem like convenient politics, but it's just not right. https://t.co/lWq4yxDwDsIt was an honor to start my morning with members of the Muslim Community of Greater Richmond to celebrate Eid al-Fitr. Eid Mubarak to the entire Virginia Muslim community! https://t.co/OC3zk8aRphFact: the Trump Administration is trying to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
https://t.co/b6JPd8clQXIt’s important to remember today that President Trump has already said, on camera, why he fired James Comey – to stop the Russia investigation. No claims the Administration might make will change that fact.The President will surely attempt to use this to discredit the ongoing criminal investigation into his campaign, so let’s be clear: this report has absolutely nothing to do with the Mueller investigation, which must be allowed to conclude without interference from the President.The release of this Inspector General report confirms what has been clear for some time: though FBI leadership made errors in judgment in the run-up to the election, those actions were not influenced by any political bias and, if anything, helped Donald Trump’s candidacy.“Anyone who just thinks this is just impacting the 12 to 15 million individuals with individual coverage is wrong.”
https://t.co/iGz5PifjBvGrateful today and every day for the soldiers in Virginia and around the world who keep us safe. #ArmyBday https://t.co/NBV0iFF3rIThis is a disgrace. https://t.co/Vn8fl7W5xKThe DMV Is #ALLCAPS https://t.co/j00Niq57BUThis isn’t toughness. This isn’t strength. It’s cruelty, and our country shouldn’t treat anyone this way, whether they’re American or not. https://t.co/0NrB7u1vxkIf we’re going to address the mounting changes to the nature of work, we need to invest in human capital. @AspenFutureWork's new proposal to create Lifelong Learning &amp; Training Accounts, which help workers learn new skills, is an important solution. https://t.co/xfRpjKkQyYRobots aren’t going to take all our jobs, but they will change the skills needed to succeed. We need to rethink our education model for a world where people may have to continually learn new skills over the course of their careers. https://t.co/gYHaIGpUm3Update: We achieved our (sorry for this) GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL. https://t.co/lU9pa9rMoqAmerica didn’t become leader of the free world by alienating our allies and cozying up to despots. https://t.co/iDlpkgRUfnChecks and balances. Both parties agree this ZTE deal is a bad deal, and we’re not going to let the Administration sell out our national security without a fight.
https://t.co/YUeODE2kSbFour fallen Americans, whose names we'll never know, were honored today at the CIA. It's a reminder of how many others put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. https://t.co/jENVSviixRThis @Capitals fan is celebrating the  #CapitalsParade from the Capitol and not even @SenSchumer is going to stop me. #ALLCAPS https://t.co/c1SSvNCjyCDiplomacy is the most viable option for pursuing the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program, but whether this will result in a verifiable agreement to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons program...America and the world will wait to find out.It’s clear that Kim Jong-un walked away from Singapore with exactly what he wanted – the pomp, circumstance and prestige of a meeting with the President of the United States – while making no specific commitments in return.We cannot go back to a time when you could be denied coverage or charged extra because of a pre-existing condition.
https://t.co/bx9t3SzqLlWhat was the point of going to the G7, insulting our closest allies, and flying off without a deal?This is the future that Putin wants. https://t.co/FvGIiWhMrC'The first few nights, he cried himself to sleep. Then it turned into “just moaning and moaning.”'

https://t.co/Ee5MOOLVXT‘Since his arrival in Michigan, family members said, a day has not gone by when the boy has failed to ask in Spanish, “When will I see my papa?”
 
They tell him the truth. They do not know. No one knows’
 
#KeepFamiliesTogether
 
https://t.co/Ee5MOOLVXTRussia is not our friend.Terrible. More Trump Administration sabotage of the health insurance that millions of families rely on. This time it's going to hit older Americans and folks with pre-existing conditions particularly hard. https://t.co/mrLlB7rzQeWe all want the President to succeed in reaching a peace deal, but this is frankly pretty concerning. Any agreement with North Korea must denuclearize the Korean peninsula and be subject to strong Congressional oversight. A deal for a deal’s sake won’t cut it https://t.co/YQc26Y7Nr2The American people overwhelmingly oppose the Trump Administration’s plan to repeal #NetNeutrality. It’s been three weeks since the Senate took action. Time for the House to do the same. https://t.co/d7pWsxYi4kThis is serious. Americans deserve to know that their private data and our national security are not being compromised through partnerships with Chinese tech companies.
https://t.co/8M8CNoAOwxThis is a great day for Virginia. Thank you @GovernorVa and to all of the Democrats and Republicans who did the right thing for thousands upon thousands of Virginia families. https://t.co/3SoRt2hycjCouldn’t agree more. Quarterly earnings guidance too often creates a focus on short-term profits when companies should be investing in workers and technology for their long-term success. https://t.co/rMbLWSilCVRule of law? For six years, Ecuador has harbored Julian Assange, a fugitive who’s endangered countless American lives and worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. Why didn’t @VP bring it up? https://t.co/BL4dkEtaOZThis idea of “embedding a compliance team” at ZTE is a nice talking point, but unless the Trump Administration plans to open an FBI counter-intel field office inside the company, Beijing is about to get one heck of a deal on a backdoor into US telecom networks. https://t.co/nlsTnnDci1I guess this is great for Wall Street, but it does squat for American workers. Another broken promise of the GOP tax bill.
https://t.co/i46Hc0K0WKInstead, the President should focus on building international coalitions to hold bad actors accountable and protect American workers.Look, we should hold China accountable for unfair trade practices, and I support strong rules to protect American workers, but the President shouldn't be relying on an obscure provision intended to uphold national security to impose tariffs on our allies. https://t.co/jGAjGmyjzyI pushed hard to get this study organized, funded, and asking the right questions. Looking forward to tomorrow’s release of this important research on the #GigEconomy.
https://t.co/Vwq1B1RAbYToday is a somber reminder of the incredible bravery of those who landed on the beaches of Normandy and behind enemy lines on #DDay. Our country is forever indebted to the US and allied troops who led the way in liberating Europe from the Nazis. #DDay74No American town sacrificed more that day, and today Bedford is home to the National D-Day Memorial, commemorating the Bedford Boys and the 10,000+ allied soldiers who gave their lives 74 years ago today. https://t.co/MdIY5uyS44On #DDay74, I’m thinking about Bedford, Va which sent 34 young Virginians into battle on #DDay. That day, 19 of them died, and four more gave their lives by the end of the Normandy campaign. https://t.co/oV4mrpiPR8If we can get this bipartisan, job-creating #hemp bill signed into law, it will be a big win for Virginia’s ag industry.
https://t.co/1ZS8sL84AAWe need answers from Facebook. The whole story, now, not six months from now. https://t.co/I7xsM8mvj4Huge mistake. ZTE poses a threat to our national security, and that’s not just my opinion. It’s the unanimous conclusion of our intelligence community. https://t.co/tgqjInNZRSThis is immoral:
https://t.co/rRDRFPp91aWhy is the President talking about pardoning himself if he has nothing to hide?This is a gut punch to Virginia farmers, who exported more than $68 million in pork to Mexico last year.  The President’s trade war is going to cost Virginia ag jobs. https://t.co/mJlDHJOSmAHere’s an idea: don’t start a trade war with our allies and raise the price of beer:
https://t.co/jzLWfwcFNoRemember when we were told the GOP tax cuts were going to the middle class? Remember when we were told companies would invest their tax savings or pass them on to workers? It all rings pretty hollow now. https://t.co/RLE75SUdKYLet’s just forget the politics for a minute and think about these kids. Whatever you think about our broken immigration system, we should all be able to agree that intentionally separating children from their parents is wrong.
https://t.co/iiUWqonWNeThis just isn’t true, but it says a lot about how the President views the powers of his office. The President is in charge of enforcing the law, but that doesn’t mean he’s above it. https://t.co/HiDMTiAulGI can’t stress this enough. Eliminating the top White House cybersecurity official is a tremendously bad idea.
https://t.co/jcDQB4BAkEThe President’s ad hoc use of the pardon power is concerning enough. But the possibility that he may also be sending a message to witnesses in a criminal investigation into his campaign is extremely dangerous. In the United States of America, no one is above the law.This has been nonsense from day one, and I think everyone recognizes that now. Unfortunately, you can’t just undo the damage done by these attacks on federal law enforcement overnight.  
https://t.co/hrq3xBRlmCIf a deal is too good to be true, there may be a reason for it. The President needs to get smart about ZTE before this “deal” does serious damage to our national security. https://t.co/KFEr8O9C0PAre robots going to take all the jobs? No, but automation will mean that learning new skills throughout your career will be a part of life in the future. We should be looking ahead and making sure our tax code, education policy, and worker training programs are ready. https://t.co/s3kMxZOYFz@GovernorVA and supporters of #Medicaid expansion should be proud of this bipartisan achievement, but the real winners here are the hardworking Virginians who will finally have healthcare for their families.I’m thrilled that partisan politics will no longer stand in the way of thousands of Virginia families getting the healthcare they need. https://t.co/wCK08Uc5TYOutdated regulations banning hemp are holding back Virginia farmers, for no good reason. @TimKaine and I are sponsoring legislation to end the federal ban on hemp, and that’ll be good news for the Virginia ag industry.
https://t.co/Ln8Qs86dfbWhen criminals pushing synthetic opioids change their formulas, our laws have to keep up. This bipartisan bill will give law enforcement the tools to tackle this piece of the opioid epidemic, and I hope we can get it on the President’s desk ASAP. https://t.co/lHWn6DjnE4Read this. We’ve got Virginians who can’t afford insurance, even though they’ve got a job. We’ve got folks who are too sick to work, for whom #Medicaid expansion is truly a life-or-death issue. It’s time for Virginia to expand Medicaid.
https://t.co/qnQCFb2A1nI hope we can all take some time today to remember the servicemembers who have made the ultimate sacrifice, leaving behind Gold Star families for whom this weekend is about much more than BBQs and a day off. We owe the fallen and their families our gratitude and a whole lot more. https://t.co/l4JXvi6rWmThis would be a big mistake. President Trump should listen to the advice of his intelligence leaders, who have unanimously said that ZTE poses a national security threat to the United States. https://t.co/vf28qBuSt4For the record, the President’s Chief of Staff and his attorney in an ongoing criminal investigation into the President’s campaign have no business showing up to a classified intelligence briefing.Big step in the right direction – and I’m glad Facebook followed through on my recommendations to improve upon earlier proposals. I’ll be pushing other companies to follow suit. But until we pass the #HonestAds Act, there'll still be a patchwork of disclosure across social media. https://t.co/QLDqsQy7pfIf there is a clear and compelling need to brief Congress on sensitive intelligence matters, it should be handled through the Gang of Eight.The Gang of Eight exists in custom and in law to ensure that Congress can oversee intelligence matters without putting sensitive sources and methods at risk.They will also be sending a terrible message to anyone who works in or with our nation’s intelligence community that the White House will always prioritize partisan politics over protecting the people who help keep this country safe.If they insist upon carrying out this farce, the White House and its Republican allies in the House will do permanent, longstanding damage to the practice of bipartisan congressional oversight of intelligence.The White House’s plan to provide a separate briefing for their political allies demonstrates that their interest is not in informing Congress, but in undermining an ongoing criminal investigation.This bill is an important step to getting veterans the healthcare they deserve more quickly and easily by providing them more options.  Now we need to follow through with strong oversight and needed investment in VA staffing and infrastructure. #VAMISSIONAct https://t.co/mUGgm35h5WCBO: Premiums up 15% next year, largely due to Trump Administration sabotage of the health insurance market. This is hurting families, particularly in Virginia. https://t.co/EA2CGlTIdCThe unfortunate consequence of baseless attacks on the men and women who keep us safe. https://t.co/WKVjXV9F3SThe problem isn’t just that the President is smearing federal law enforcement as the “criminal deep state,” whatever that means. It’s that he’s doing it to undermine an ongoing criminal investigation into his campaign. This is a threat to the rule of law.20 years ago today, the Senate held its first #cybersecurity hearing w/ members of the L0pht hacker collective. Today, @SenCoryGardner &amp; I brought them back to testify at the Cyberscurity Caucus’ #L0pht20 hearing on what Congress *still* needs to do to improve our cybersecurity. https://t.co/B6qyezkrSuWow. The Trump Administration’s sabotage of the healthcare market could cost Virginia families an average of $1,312 in higher premiums.
https://t.co/FPyYHhulfjThe idea that this is all some sort of plot to take down the President is completely contradicted by every known fact about this investigation. https://t.co/jTzzdyBbjyPage ii https://t.co/0i5oPheE6y.@SecNielsen, you’re our front line of defense against the Russian cyber threat. Please read the ICA report. Its conclusions couldn’t be clearer: https://t.co/LLak67wbuh https://t.co/eqCeHOj1m4Anyone who is entrusted with our nation’s highest secrets should act with the gravity and seriousness of purpose that knowledge deserves.It would be at best irresponsible, and at worst potentially illegal, for members of Congress to use their positions to learn the identity of an FBI source for the purpose of undermining the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in our election.Publicly outing a source risks not only their life, but the lives of every American, because when sources are burned it makes it that much harder for every part of the intelligence community to gather intelligence on those who wish to do us harm.The first thing any new member of the Intelligence Committee learns is the critical importance of protecting sources and methods.Everyone needs to pay attention to this. This is not ok. Here's why: https://t.co/eOj0j2SO6WI want answers about the Trump Administration’s failure to implement sanctions against Russia that Congress passed last year.
 
These sanctions aren’t optional. They’re the law of the land, and the President is required to follow them. Period. https://t.co/mb246nIql6We shouldn’t accept a reality where phrases like “another school shooting” are just part of daily life. My heart is with the people of Santa Fe, because these kids and their families are going through hell. But frankly, that doesn’t feel like it’s enough. This has got to stop.This “Domestic Gag Rule” puts government in the way of women’s most personal reproductive health decisions. The President should leave these decisions to women and their doctors.
https://t.co/eG5VEu7pCoThat’s not a witch hunt; it’s a career lawman doing his job and doing it well. https://t.co/dYITPbAlCiWishing a happy #Ramadan to all those in the Muslim community celebrating across Virginia. Best wishes for this special month.When you tune out the noise, the facts speak for themselves: Mueller is conducting a thorough, professional investigation into Russia’s attack on our democracy, which has resulted in 5 guilty pleas and the indictment of the President’s campaign manager and 13 Russian operatives..@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, it’s been 50 days since you fired the @DeptVetAffairs Secretary, and still no replacement. Please nominate a qualified candidate ASAP so we can have the stable VA leadership our veterans deserve.Applauding my Republican colleagues who are bucking leadership to do the right thing for #DREAMers. We can’t give up on a bipartisan #DACA solution.
https://t.co/9992jxhoQTImportant op-ed from @PattyMurray. We need to keep at it until we have a bipartisan deal to lower families’ health insurance costs. The Trump Administration’s sabotage of the market is not the answer.
https://t.co/JA8nLAkl8fI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. This is an incredibly bad idea.
https://t.co/sEIhmaDJ5YBIG: The Senate just passed a bipartisan resolution to block the Trump Administration’s plan to repeal #NetNeutrality https://t.co/hmCzimQ2VaOur adversaries are investing heavily in 21st century cyberwarfare capabilities, and if we only view national security through a conventional 20th century lens, we’re going to find ourselves unable to respond to increasingly asymmetric cyber threats down the road.It’s frankly mindboggling that the Trump Administration has eliminated the top White House official responsible for a whole-of-government cyber strategy, at a time when the cyber threat to our nation is greater than ever. https://t.co/eS82N9bAJfCONFIRMED: After a thorough review, Senate Intel has found no evidence to dispute the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia, on orders from Putin, carried out an unprecedented election interference effort to help the Trump campaign and hurt the Clinton campaign in 2016. https://t.co/OWshLwnQA0Today’s the day: the Senate will vote on the repeal of #NetNeutrality. I’m voting to stop the Trump Administration’s #NetNeutrality repeal plan. https://t.co/pe3CZKByVRI’ve been in the technology business longer than I’ve been in politics, and I can tell you the Trump Administration’s plan to repeal #NetNeutrality is bad news for consumers, small businesses, and the entire internet. I’m voting to stop the repeal of Net Neutrality.Joining @GovernorVA and the whole law enforcement community here in Virginia in remembering these fallen officers and commemorating #PeaceOfficersMemorialDay. #PoliceWeek https://t.co/rZwjwuxPXtAmen. If ZTE is a security threat, then it is a security threat and needs to be dealt with as such — not as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. https://t.co/VRqeL3Jr88My statement on the nomination of Gina Haspel to be CIA Director: https://t.co/eEgyBXC1tWHere’s the point: we should be investing in our nation’s cyber defense, not rolling it back.  We also need to articulate a clear cyber doctrine. I don’t see how getting rid of the top cyber official in the White House does anything to make our country safer from cyber threats.That’s just a snapshot of the threat we face from state actors. We can’t forget about the threat from non-state cybercriminals. The Administration’s own economists estimate cybercrime cost the U.S. economy between $57-$109 BILLION in 2016 alone. https://t.co/i9YgVLwrrBNot to mention the Russian threat to our state and local election systems — in 2016, Russia targeted at least 18 state election systems, and although no votes were changed, in some cases they were able to access restricted elements of our election systems. https://t.co/6zkIZnfpQ7The Russian military has initiated massive cyber attacks against Ukraine and other European nations, which have also impacted U.S. computers https://t.co/phDKOW1BGrThen there’s China, which we recently learned has been operating a much larger state-sponsored hacking operation than previously known. https://t.co/9UicqYkrXPAnd frankly it’s pretty troubling that the same forces in the Administration who aggressively pushed for the U.S. to exit the Iran deal are now seeking to eliminate the exact position that will be tasked with assessing and responding to Iran’s cyber aggression.In the wake of President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran Deal, we’re already seeing the makings of an increased cyber threat from Iran. https://t.co/3Bz2DLGBMdJust over a year ago, the Wannacry attack hit 230,000+ computers around the world — crippling hospitals, banks, transportation systems, and other important institutions. Our intelligence community concluded North Korea was behind the attack. https://t.co/FzZPCSPteoWe face threats from foreign adversaries and bad actors around the globe, and these threats are only going to get worse. Here are just a few examples of what we’re facing:Mr. President, if you really want to put America first, don’t cut the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator — the only person in the federal government tasked with delivering a coordinated, whole-of-government response to the growing cyber threats facing our nation. https://t.co/MRkwA8et7yGreat catching up with the men and women of the Westmoreland County Sheriff's Department ahead of #PoliceWeek #Policeweek2018 https://t.co/P8Pl3KRhQiAMEN. To all the military spouses in Va, and around the country and the world, thank you. #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay https://t.co/9kXbalo8UXThis just isn’t true. Virginia families just found out they’ll start feeling the effects of the Trump Administration’s sabotage of the ACA in 2019. We don’t need excuses, we need a bipartisan solution to lower premiums. https://t.co/aYcBzbQYkKThe folks at @FASWVA are doing the Lord’s work, making sure families in #SWVA facing tough times can still put food on the table. We talked this week about making sure that, as Congress works on the 2018 Farm Bill, we don’t forget about Va families facing food insecurity. https://t.co/pOIkonL4xtMake no mistake, these price increases are a consequence of the Trump Administration’s efforts to sabotage the health insurance market &amp; dismantle the ACA. The right thing to do here is pass bipartisan legislation to stabilize the market &amp; provide affordable options for 2019. https://t.co/VMxYOx3DhtBombarding the Justice Department with document requests simply to create a pretext for firing or impeaching our nation’s senior law enforcement officials is a blatant abuse of power that should concern everyone who believes in the rule of law, Republican and Democrat alike.The Senate Intel Committee's confirmation hearing of Gina Haspel for CIA Director will begin at 9:30 AM. Watch live: https://t.co/cIahbojOVJToday on #TeacherAppreciationDay, I just want to say thank you to all the teachers across the Commonwealth who’ve devoted their careers to educating Virginia’s kids. We don’t say that often enough.Withdrawing from the Iran deal makes the United States, and the world, less secure.Glad to see Facebook introducing transparency requirements for issue ads, a measure I proposed last year along with @AmyKlobuchar &amp; @SenJohnMcCain. We need to pass our #HonestAds Act so that other platforms play by the same rules, just like broadcast, cable &amp; satellite providers. https://t.co/gZT3Zfj6aTGoing back on a deal is bad.

Going back on a deal in order to cut billions from children’s health insurance is worse. https://t.co/KLcjyk8LpWThis kind of thing should worry all of us, Republican and Democrat alike. I am honestly concerned that the President and his allies are doing lasting damage to the FBI and the rule of law in this country. https://t.co/qxIYuruqLrThis is a consequence of years of underinvestment in Metro, and Virginia commuters — who have already sacrificed a lot — have a right to be frustrated. I intend to press WMATA to make sure that this will yield real long-term results, with the least disruption possible. https://t.co/DjqJMLR7UcToday and every day, I’m grateful for the men and women of the FBI who’ve come through Quantico on their way to a career of service to our country. https://t.co/B0Mg4j9M4oI know that Dr. Steger will be missed by the whole Tech family.I’ve known Dr. Steger for more than 30 years &amp; I always knew him not only as an advocate for @virginia_tech, but for educational opportunity for all Virginians. I was proud to call him my friend, and I have incredibly fond memories of our fight together to get Tech into the ACC. https://t.co/Pe3ZyaTBqVCongratulations @UVa_Wise class of 2018! https://t.co/JdS7nBHYksBack with my friends from @MineWorkers in #SWVA, one year to the day since we passed legislation to #KeepThePromise to our miners and protect their healthcare. https://t.co/Lsiju98RLkCongratulations @JCHSRoanokeVA class of 2018! https://t.co/dKOIMJ0BVaThank you to @BullnBones Brewhaus and Grill for hosting our Community Leaders Happy Hour in Blacksburg. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/ILvafHgs6AIt was really humbling to join the first responders from Smyth County to commemorate #InternationalFirefightersDay in Marion. https://t.co/xcgF8u7xgaJoe was absolutely relentless in the fight to save our miner's healthcare last year, and I was proud to stand with him in that effort. https://t.co/N7vCQ9dMlGEstoy decepcionado y se me parte el corazón al ver que la Administración del Presidente Trump ha terminado arbitrariamente la designación “TPS” que protege a miles de inmigrantes hondureños.Disappointed and heartbroken that the Trump Administration has arbitrarily ended the TPS designation that protects thousands of Hondurans.Exciting stuff happening at @StauntonHub, an innovative coworking space for entrepreneurs in the Shenandoah Valley.  Great meeting with local entrepreneurs and Mayor Dull. Can’t wait to see what comes next from this project. https://t.co/zZ1Kq9637uThere’s no reason you should have to leave your hometown to find a good-paying, high-tech job. With all of the talent and innovation that’s fueling SWVA’s tech scene, that’s never been truer. Thank you @RBTechCouncil for inviting me to join you for #TechNite2018 https://t.co/rEO8xJrsnzGood times at the 73rd Annual Augusta County @4H and @NationalFFA Market Animal Show in Fishersville. This is the largest event of its kind of the East Coast, and it was great to meet the students who put it on. https://t.co/qPH4R8EjK9President Abbas’ attempt to perpetuate the anti-Semitic myths behind the Holocaust is disturbing and dangerous.

https://t.co/Aid5b7m5HuIncredibly proud of all that Brooke has accomplished. She’s going to make a fine midshipman, and I’m honored to have recommended her to the @NavalAcademy.
https://t.co/dtnQNwLfWoWhen you've got 700,000 people waiting to get their clearances processed, often unnecessarily, government isn't working efficiently, Virginia businesses lose money, and frankly it's bad for national security.

@RTDNews Editorial Board: https://t.co/5DNhCI4dxuProud to have helped secure this funding with @TimKaine to improve veterans’ long-term care needs in Virginia Beach. We'll continue to do all we can in the Senate to support Virginia's veterans. They deserve it. https://t.co/vbIiauJmfhHeard from national security and cybersecurity professionals in Fredericksburg. I think we all agree our security clearance system is completely, completely broken. I'm working on legislation that will finally fix this. https://t.co/UELXDeLFGthttps://t.co/3SoQ7tyJBOIf the Administration wants to get serious about fixing the backlog — and I hope they will — they should get behind my bipartisan bill, which would fund maintainence for Appamattox, the Blue Ridge Parkway, and other parks &amp; other NPS assets in Va using existing federal revenue:I appreciate Secretary Zinke's interest in dealing with the massive national parks maintainence backlog. BUT the Administration's proposal (which seems based on my bill) really isn't a sustainable solution. https://t.co/pJU7IVQ9qcA number of people have raised legitimate questions about Gina Haspel’s nomination to be CIA Director that deserve thorough answers. I think the more transparency we have here, the better.Proud of my colleagues from both parties who stepped up to pass this important bill. Now it’s time for the full Senate to do its job and vote on this legislation to #ProtectMueller. Leadership should not stand in the way. https://t.co/HYznrVkLG4Not a lot of people are talking about this, but it’s important. Independent/freelance/#GigEconomy workers are a growing part of our economy, and we need to update our social safety net to address the changing nature of work.
https://t.co/ZCMkcAFsqHGreat bipartisan meeting today on the future of work with @Airbnb CEO @Bchesky, @JeffFlake, @AmyKlobuchar, @SenBennetCO, and @BenSasse. https://t.co/7tAMk9jKJOPara muchos beneficiarios de TPS, la eliminación de la designación podría significar vida o muerte en regresar a sus países natales. Yo y @timkaine le pedimos a la administración que prolonguen este programa que protege a miles de hondureños.For many TPS recipients, the elimination of the program could mean life or death if they return to their country of origin. Today @TimKaine and I urged the Administration to extend the TPS designation that protects thousands of Hondurans. https://t.co/daA78VeD8bI’ve heard it over and over again when I hold town halls in rural communities: the lack of consistent broadband coverage is a major issue for folks from the Eastern Shore to Southwest Virginia. Partnerships like this are an important part of the solution. https://t.co/qD8uzaM2NjThe President should continue to engage in the important diplomatic work we witnessed this week. We’ve been told that “America first is not America alone.” I hope President Trump will do what it takes to live up to that mission.This week’s visit from President Macron also highlights the importance of our alliances with countries who share our values. It’s a reminder that building, strengthening, and preserving these alliances takes work.The truth is, there are people who want to use technology to drive us apart. We must resist this.And it means all of us, as consumers of information, must treat the information we see on the internet and social media with a healthy dose of skepticism.It also means tech companies need to embrace their civic responsibility as American companies and tackle these challenges head-on.That means working with France and our other Western allies to confront Russian cyber aggression. This, by the way, will require the President to recognize Russia’s attack against us in the 2016 election and lead a government-wide response to this ongoing threat.It’s on all of us, from the US and our allies to tech companies and consumers, to work together and make sure the internet continues to be a force for good, not a safe harbor for our adversaries and other bad actors.Appreciate President @EmmanuelMacron calling attention to the “virus of fake news” and other challenges facing Western democracies in the digital age.  https://t.co/eRBibGsZvoThere’s a reason Abraham Lincoln called the USDA “The People’s Department.” Today, we need to double down on that commitment to rural communities across the country. Our bill would underscore that part of USDA’s mission is increasing economic opportunity in rural America. https://t.co/esEzK44PW9@byrdinator Oops https://t.co/NqQbYrY9AHAlright folks, who’s ready for [drumroll please]...
 
🚨 A 13-tweet thread about fixing the #NationalParks maintenance backlog 🚨
 
Form an orderly queue, and if you make it to tweet #13, enjoy the pictures of Virginia’s magnificent national parks. #NationalParksWeek https://t.co/VNNll9BLxnIn conclusion, and since you’ve read through 12 tweets about revenue streams for deferred park maintenance, here are some photos of some of Virginia’s magnificent #NationalParks. Thanks for reading. #NationalParksWeek https://t.co/WZhj4rWtEbI hope the Administration will take another look at my bill with @SenRobPortman, the National Park Service Legacy Act, because it really begins to solve this $11.6 billion problem.The point here is we need a bipartisan solution that doesn’t just put a band-aid on the problem. If we want to preserve the beauty and history of our national parks for future generations, we need to work together to fully fund the National Park Service’s maintenance backlog.That doesn't mean new taxes or new drilling, just spending our money more wisely and solving the problem.I introduced a bill last year with @SenRobPortman that has a straightforward solution: use existing money already collected by the federal government from oil and natural gas revenues to fix our parks.Here’s a better idea:tl;dr – Tying funding for national parks maintenance to unrealistic projections about the price of oil doesn’t solve much of anything in the long run. Frankly, it puts us right back where we started.The Administration has started to come around to the idea of using existing revenue to fix this problem. Unfortunately, they’ve landed on an idea, supported by some Democrats, that isn’t sustainable in the long term.
https://t.co/noz8wIkjT3First, the Trump Administration proposed hiking fees on our national parks, sticking families with the costs of Congress’ mismanagement. No one liked that idea, prompting the #HikeTrailsNotFees backlash and forcing the administration to reconsider its position.Most people agree that something must be done to address our national parks maintenance backlog. The problem, as usual, is how you pay for it.Virginia ranks 5th in terms of states with the greatest need for maintenance. Over $800 million in deferred maintenance has left Shenandoah, Jamestown, Fredericksburg, the Blue Ridge Parkway, and other national parks in need of significant repairs.Unfortunately, years of underfunding has produced a massive $11.6 billion (with a B) maintenance backlog at our national parks. Many are in a critical state of disrepair. https://t.co/FDguODrCgNFrom Yellowstone to Joshua Tree, Everglades to Shenandoah here in Virginia, our #NationaParks are a treasured part of America’s natural history and heritage. #NationalParksWeek https://t.co/67qG0TAcFHI’ve been saying for years that Yahoo’s failure to notify customers and investors about its massive data breach didn’t pass the smell test. Holding the company accountable is important, and I hope others will learn you can’t sweep this kind of thing under the rug. https://t.co/vt9WJbVgKzThe Administration’s effort to expand #JunkPlans will mean higher healthcare costs and worse coverage, especially for folks with pre-existing conditions. Both parties need to work together to lower healthcare costs, but this isn’t the way to do it. https://t.co/EUshjh5nkQOutrageous. https://t.co/Ygyh8ZdxzECongress needs to get serious about #cybersecurity, particularly the threats posed by unsecured internet-connected devices. Encouraged to see tech companies stepping up, but we’ve all got to work together to get ahead of the curve on #IoTSecurity.
https://t.co/2F3D5yjh7r“Within a decade, our debt-to-GDP ratio will be at its highest level since 1946…Today, with unemployment at an 18-year low and the country enjoying one of the longest recoveries on record, it is difficult to explain why we’ve spilled so much red ink.”
https://t.co/ENk1mJnODLHad the privilege of meeting Chief Rader earlier this year. She’s making a big difference fighting the opioid epidemic in Huntington, #WV. Read @Sen_JoeManchin’s profile of @BlazinWV for #Time100
https://t.co/bsVV9gLILvGreat meeting Roark Corson of Virginia Beach, @Op_Homefront’s 2018 @USCG Military Child of the Year. With some good timing, he got to meet @SecNav76 on his way out of our meeting. https://t.co/8enhtYIUo1“To millions, the Special Counsel is either a political savior or berserk villain. He is neither. He’s a by-the-book lawman who, with nothing to prove &amp; a lifetime of service behind him, agreed to lead the most fraught, least understood, highest-stakes investigation of our time.” https://t.co/DpxbgC96HD.@EPA Administrator Pruitt has wasted taxpayer money and abused the powers of his office, ignoring all sorts of lobbying and ethics rules along the way. The American people deserve better from their government. It’s time for Mr. Pruitt to resign.Accurate and troubling: “President Trump and Congress have not only massively expanded the U.S. government’s debt, they have broken free of multiple guardrails intended to keep budgets balanced…”
https://t.co/Epssi15q3LJoining millions of Americans tonight in mourning the loss of Barbara Bush, wife and mother of presidents and a woman of extraordinary strength and character. I have especially fond memories of a visit she made to Richmond when I was Governor. Mrs. Bush will be deeply missed.The exact opposite of what the GOP promised the American people about their tax bill. #TaxDay https://t.co/RqeMorWuaQStill true. And it’s going to get even more complicated next year under the Republican tax bill. #TaxDay https://t.co/Sz3Yl9jQ7sLearn more about the Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity Improvement Act: https://t.co/YBqNXxJ5EVThis kind of thing can happen to anyone with unsecured #IoT devices, including the federal government. Right now, the federal government doesn’t even have a minimum security standard for these kinds of internet-connected devices. My bill would change that. https://t.co/gellrozSEHI’ll venture a guess here: it’s because the Republican tax cuts are overwhelmingly going to shareholders, not workers. #TaxDay https://t.co/aZ9gj9iTlsIf Congressional Republicans had gotten this right, it would be the other way around. #TaxDay https://t.co/Lofb3GMyN6Glad to hear @SenJohnMcCain is stable and recovering. Keep John and the whole McCain family in your prayers. https://t.co/mUYr95CWWCWow. This study is a bombshell. Congress needs to pass the #HonestAds Act so we can start to get a handle on this. https://t.co/qsiEEp4MNZI want to congratulate @RyanMKellyPhoto on winning a Pulitzer Prize for his incredible photos of a dark day for the Commonwealth. These images are part of history now, and it’s my hope that they’ll help us learn from it.   
https://t.co/NXT5cmI5F2There's been some good progress at the VA, but there's a lot more Congress and the Administration can do to make sure we're giving veterans the best care possible. We can't lose sight of that or who it is we're serving.Malik was injured serving in the Navy, and when he lost the use of one of his hands, that also meant he couldn't play pool anymore. Now he has a pool cue that lets him shoot one-handed while he recovers, with a device 3D-printed at McGuire. https://t.co/00sQiVEl99Josh is a Marine who lost the use of his arms and legs when he was injured, but when I saw him, he was walking on his own two feet, thanks to a robotic exoskeleton and his own perseverance. I've never seen anything like it. https://t.co/UIS6k7nP7bReally humbling to visit the McGuire VA in Richmond. The veterans I met while I was there deserve the absolute best care, and I was encouraged to meet the doctors and other providers who are taking care of them. A couple stories worth sharing:The President’s reluctance to stand up to Putin is just baffling. https://t.co/TBThYpHNoCIt’s been 11 years since the Virginia Tech tragedy that claimed the lives of 32 Hokies. We can’t forget those we lost or stop working towards a world where these shootings are a thing of the past.  #VTWeRemember https://t.co/gHIatU5CJJMy statement on the Missile Strikes In Syria: https://t.co/8IahHA3rLgPresident Trump's blatant efforts to undermine our law enforcement agencies and the independence of the Special Counsel should trouble us all. Congress and the American people must hold him accountable for any attempt to interfere in this investigation.Great to start the morning out at Charlottesville's #TomTomFest and celebrate Virginia's thriving entrepreneur community. https://t.co/kcvO9EnqVp
