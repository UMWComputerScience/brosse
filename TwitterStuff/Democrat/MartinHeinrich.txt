This land is vitally important to #NM. https://t.co/cO4Jqlen3wSevere drought conditions this early in the year should be a wakeup call for our state about the seriousness of climate change’s impact on our water supply that we all depend on. https://t.co/Ze0obsqic7New Mexico is leading the way in #solarpower! These projects will spur job creation in rural #NM and generate billions of dollars in economic impact. These opportunities are vital for diversifying our economy; moving towards a clean energy future. https://t.co/UHOcxnY8VhThe way to fix the “going dark” problem isn’t to overstate its threat. We need a solution that doesn’t involve forcing companies to build backdoors into their encryption systems, since that also means opening Americans’ data to hackers and foreign regimes. https://t.co/ZCvBX64nYdNew Mexico’s @SandiaLabs is leading the way on #solar! I can’t wait to see the results of this exciting project that has the potential to transform the way we harness solar energy. https://t.co/2b8Dj6f5NsThank you to the community members in southern New Mexico who celebrated the 4th anniversary of #OMDP4NM by keeping our monument clean for all to enjoy. #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/HIw1Tv0bIOI’m proud to introduce legislation with @SenatorTomUdall that would protect the remaining #ChacoCanyon ruins and landscape nearest to the existing @ChacoCultureNHP from federal mineral development. https://t.co/fpfE1hsgxSThe Chaco region holds deep meaning to New Mexico's Pueblos, whose history and traditional knowledge reside in its thousands of ancestral sites, as well as to the Navajo Nation, whose lands and communities surround much of @ChacoCultureNHP. https://t.co/6VPHVqH6Ar#ChacoCanyon is a sacred site that is revered by all NM &amp; deserves to be protected from any harmful development that would damage its precious historical &amp; cultural resources. https://t.co/MoOE3XSuDHDYK that New Mexico ranks among the top states for its biodiversity?  #4 according to @natureserve.Today is #IntlBiodiversityDay! We cherish our state’s incredible plants &amp; wildlife in NM. I’ve made #conservation a top priority, but there remains significant work to do to safeguard #biodiversity in New Mexico and across the globe.Thank you to everyone who came out to my housing summit in Carlsbad this week! You can count on me to continue working with community leaders to ensure all families in Carlsbad have an affordable place to call home. https://t.co/zwkgrT6zW6This is what racial profiling looks like. https://t.co/Mr1FrHJ5sNI’ve been so proud to stand with the local communities who worked for many years to establish Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument. Let’s keep working to protect the places important to all of us for our children and all future generations. #OMDP4NM #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/ZFFwdfouZSNM’s public lands like #OMDP4NM are major drivers of our economy. Last year, @OIA found that the outdoor recreation economy directly contributes $9.9 billion in annual consumer spending and employs 99,000 people in New Mexico. https://t.co/7J9otkSieEDue in large part to the community’s commitment to protecting our #publiclands &amp; #OMDP4NM southern New Mexico has become a national model for how much public lands &amp; specially designated areas can boost local economies. https://t.co/VpDqxZ1OU3Happy Birthday #OMDP4NM! 4 years ago, OMDP became our newest national monument in New Mexico. In the years since its designation this beautiful landscape has brought pride to the local community &amp; helped fuel our outdoor recreation economy in southern New Mexico. #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/SRMolg9Tu1No day like #KidsToParks Day to #OptOutside with your family! Parks offer so many opportunities to get outside and experience the Land of Enchantment. What’s your favorite place to enjoy the great outdoors in #NM? https://t.co/N9XDmsIuufToday, parks across the country are free for kids and their families to celebrate #KidsToParks Day! Take advantage of our #PublicLands and find your closest park in #NM here: https://t.co/eQT6ZYRurP @natparktrustI was proud to introduce bipartisan resolution that designates today National #KidsToParks Day. https://t.co/CRXDvhIDdJIt’s clear that there is still so much work to be done in #PuertoRico. President Trump’s administration’s decision to leave the island while Puerto Rican Americans are still recovering &amp; preparing for hurricane season is unacceptable. https://t.co/SLk7w5BlnXPres Trump’s dangerous plan tacks on new restrictions to Title X, the nation’s program for affordable birth control &amp; reproductive health care that millions of people rely on. I oppose any attempt to make it more difficult for NMs to access the health care they need. #NoGagRulePresident Trump's #SolarTariffs are jeopardizing tens of thousands of good-paying American jobs &amp; hurting the economy in #NM. That doesn't sound like putting “America First” to me. @ABQBizFirst https://t.co/4nIQEukpbHMy heart breaks for Santa Fe, Texas. We need to wake up from this nightmare &amp; stop accepting these horrific shooting as the status quo. Action to end gun violence now!Judicial nominees refusing to say that #BrownVBoard was decided correctly is completely disqualifying. Period. I'm concerned that Trump Admin continues to appoint people #UnfitToJudge that when approved spend the rest of their lives on the Federal Bench.Proud to lead a bipartisan group of Senators with @SenRobPortman urging Trump Admin to take additional steps to combat Anti-Semitism, appoint Special Envoy. https://t.co/fgcPlHau6l https://t.co/e2owW3jD0aIf you need further proof that President Trump still isn’t taking #CyberSecurity &amp; threats from Russia’s online army seriously: https://t.co/PSJmCLsj2sI’m voting NO on Gina Haspel today. Her failure to take personal responsibility for any role she might have played in CIA’s torture program &amp; her conflicting replies to questions about the destruction of videotapes related to the program make her unsuitable to lead the CIA.The vote to confirm Gina Haspel is today, yet Senators are still being blocked from seeing a key piece of her story &amp; history with CIA torture program and destruction of tapes. We must #UnlockDurhamReport so Senators know the truth before they cast their vote.My bipartisan #StopAct bill would prohibit the exporting of sacred Native American items and increase penalties for stealing and illegally trafficking tribal cultural patrimony.Proud to announce exciting #StopAct momentum! My bill to Safeguard Tribal Items was voted favorably out of the Indian Affairs Committee today. Now onto the full Senate! https://t.co/6kCaXD6q3wThere is no good reason for the lack of response to #PuertoRico, and now new hurricanes on the horizon pose even greater threats. No American should ever be left in danger like this. https://t.co/QMunsvFfsNWe just voted to restore #NetNeutrality &amp; we won! Thank you to everyone who spoke out to #SaveTheInternet, we won’t stop fighting because access to a free and open internet effects everyone. https://t.co/LSf5gjw9TbIt’s time to right the Trump Administration’s wrong: Americans need #NetNeutrality, because access to the open internet fosters the creativity and innovation that is at the heart of our economy.There’s a real sense of urgency around #NetNeutrality, because Americans see this for what it is: a giveaway to big companies that takes money right out of your pockets. #SaveTheInternetWe can’t let President Trump’s @FCC destroy the internet. I’m voting to #SaveTheInternet because without #NetNeutrality this is what the internet would look like. https://t.co/G9h0IyG3JXMy staff will also be holding Mobile Office Hours starting at 3pm at the Walter Gerrells Performing Arts and Exhibition Center in Carlsbad to help folks with things like Social Security benefits, Medicare, veterans benefits, student loans, immigration, and other federal programs.REMINDER: Today, I'm partnering with the City of Carlsbad, Carlsbad Department of Development &amp; NM Mortgage Finance Authority to host a Housing Summit from 4-7pm at the Walter Gerrells Performing Arts and Exhibition Center in Carlsbad. All are welcome! https://t.co/7pRsshC996Since the @FCC voted to remove #NetNeutrality rules, New Mexicans have been making their voices heard. The message is loud and clear: they don’t want their right to a free and open internet blocked.In my view Gina Haspel’s failure to take personal responsibility for any role she might have played in the CIA’s detention &amp; interrogation program &amp; her conflicting replies to questions about the destruction of videotapes related to the program make her unsuitable to lead the CIAToday I voted against Gina Haspel to be Director of the CIA. https://t.co/cy8BitdIcUI’m voting to #SaveTheInternet in the Senate today. Make your voice heard &amp; RT if you’d vote YES to restore critical #NetNeutrality rules. https://t.co/jOouCZ4U4tThe brand new #ABQ Complex is a vital investment for #NM, ensuring the dedicated staff of one of our state’s biggest economic contributors is working out of a modern, state-of-the-art workplace. https://t.co/r8TusFGBTSPurposefully neglecting proven science, a whole pile of ethics violations--the case for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s resignation keeps getting stronger. https://t.co/eYFEnultL1It doesn’t make sense for Pres Trump to undercut the advice &amp; judgment of the national security community, which has warned that ZTE poses a major cybersecurity threat to the United States, to help save Chinese jobs. https://t.co/ktkkms8k7AIt's time to permanently protect the area surrounding Chaco Culture National Historical Park. These lands hold much meaning to the Navajo Nation and New Mexico Pueblos who consider the sites sacred. https://t.co/LleLzUEwsiCheck out the latest episode of @MeatEaterTV podcast for my in-depth conversation with @stevenrinella on #PublicLands, conservation, #LWCF and hunting and fishing in New Mexico here: https://t.co/e23mXKLDquWe’re demanding answers from @DeptofDefense on the decision to remove the security risks of #climatechange from this key report. https://t.co/EO51igxMJU https://t.co/RHm3ll1TrfNo senator can consider Haspel’s nomination in good conscience without first reviewing the deeply troubling Durham Report. #UnlockDurhamReportThe American people still have a lot of concerns &amp; unanswered questions about Gina Haspel's record, including any role she might have played in helping run the CIA's torture program &amp; advocating for the destruction of evidence of that torture. #UnlockDurhamReportHas your Senator read the Durham Report on CIA Director nominee Gina Haspel’s potential role in destroying torture tapes? RT if you agree we must #UnlockDurhamReport before casting a vote on her confirmation. https://t.co/BNcd1piSjZEvery senator should be able to read the Durham Report on the destruction of torture videotapes before voting on Gina Haspel to be Director of the CIA. #UnlockDurhamReport https://t.co/KjU3YmUHIp#UnlockDurhamReport https://t.co/DewqOtvFWUCongratulations to all the 2018 New Mexico graduates!

The Trump Administration’s move to deliberately rip apart families has no place in our country. https://t.co/ct9XoYyiykThe Trump Admin still hasn’t provided a response to this letter sent in March by 14 senators on the status of a cyber deterrence strategy either. Instead, Bolton wants to essentially get rid of the Cyber lead for the federal government? https://t.co/0vA0KErc0UNational Security Advisor Bolton should be protecting us from threats, not opening us up to new ones. Cutting a key cyber role is the opposite of what we need &amp; shows that the Trump Admin still isn't taking the threat from Russia's online army seriously. https://t.co/tr3mP0YF5FThese attacks by Fox news ring hollow – the fact is that #Solar is working in communities across the nation. https://t.co/POVq3j9GDxThis backward, antiquated thinking has no place in America, let alone the Oval Office.

My full statement on the decision to withdraw from the Iran Deal: https://t.co/ewE4lXKq8LThe President just handed religious extremists in Iran’s government a major victory. Leaving the Iran deal, green lights the country’s nuclear program, jeopardizes our credibility, and threatens American security.It was a pleasure to meet with Aztec Police Department Chief Mike Heal in Farmington last week. I’m committed to keeping New Mexicans safe &amp; look forward to working together on these critical issues. https://t.co/2tyo2u3iBjI’m having a hard time wrapping my head around this – why would @FEMA declare their mission accomplished in Puerto Rico when tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans Americans are still without power? https://t.co/IFKSiRGjjTI cannot imagine a scenario where the @USACEHQ and @FEMA would leave 20,000 Texans or Floridians without power, yet they’re planning to leave Puerto Rico in the dark. https://t.co/ikrnZJo8nqI’m thankful for all the teachers in New Mexico who play such a huge role in shaping our future leaders.

https://t.co/DMRNbZgcqVWe’re calling on the CIA to declassify information on Gina Haspel’s role in the Enhanced Interrogation Program.

Read the @CrucesSunNews editorial in support of the shift here: https://t.co/ZybyUIuhPrI’m deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Navajo Code Talker Roy Hawthorne, Sr. My thoughts are with his entire family &amp; the community as we mourn his loss and honor his heroic service to our nation. https://t.co/Rzz8kAvmy8We secured a major victory in combatting fires. Now federal agencies can draw from disaster &amp; emergency funds during large fire seasons rather than borrow money from their forest restoration programs. Read my op-ed about wildfire funding fix here: https://t.co/fhG5uDrSZvICYMI: I was on @KRWG’s #VoiceOfThePublic last week &amp; was able to talk with NMs about everything from health care to immigration. Thanks for having me on! https://t.co/xkkJrKJjm2President Trump is doing everything he can to sabotage our nation’s health care system. If you’d like to share your thoughts with HHS deserves on the new #JunkPlans proposal, here’s the link: https://t.co/nRoAL087REQuestion: What do you call #TrumpCare “health insurance” that doesn’t cover prescription drug costs, maternity care, or basic health screenings &amp; leads to higher costs for people with pre-existing conditions? 
Answer: #JunkPlans https://t.co/OWoYEjnaXdI’m working to tackle poverty &amp; introduced the #2Gen Empowerment Act to ensure young people &amp; their families can thrive no matter their zip code. https://t.co/9rWhstG9n1I’m so proud of #NM’s leadership on #WindPower. The Sagamore Wind Project is going to be the largest in our state’s history and will create jobs &amp; fuel our rural economy. My op-ed in the @thenewmexican https://t.co/Z5X5RncMP4It's time to recognize that health care is a human right and the best way to make that a reality in America is to build on what we all know works. New Mexicans should be able to choose Medicare. https://t.co/b4bmgDTaj7Today, how about a visit to a @NatlParkService Park? #NationalParksDay is a chance to get outside and enjoy nature free of charge. #FindYourPark in one of NM’s NPS sites today!If you want to see the benefits of #STEM education, look no further! With a background in engineering, I’m so impressed by the @newmexicotech students who built a rocket with @spaceport_nm that broke the sound barrier. https://t.co/7PImfQ4gxMIt's time to legalize marijuana.Every New Mexican should have #CleanAir to breathe. That’s why we’re fighting the repeal of the BLM #MethaneRule that would be a major step backward for our environment &amp; the health of New Mexicans. https://t.co/JrltcCw9JMThe American people expect &amp; deserve to understand the backgrounds of gov leaders. Without further declassification of Gina Haspel’s background, we cannot properly fulfill our constitutional duty to “advise and consent” on her nomination. https://t.co/9Lnlm0tJzhI am dismayed that SSCI has chosen to schedule a nomination hearing for Gina Haspel before the CIA has responded to the five requests that I &amp; fellow Committee Members have sent asking for further declassification of her troubling record. https://t.co/jDBegn7IF0Looking forward to talking with New Mexicans today on @KRWG’s #VoiceOfThePublic with Edmundo Resendez. Tune in at 1pm &amp; call 575-646-2212 https://t.co/g4CBFPsdE4I couldn’t agree more! “As we all know, New Mexico is a windy place. Let those gale forces blow us into a brighter future.” Via @thenewmexican https://t.co/myyZIOCUA5
