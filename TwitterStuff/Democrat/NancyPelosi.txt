Ending the Trump Administration‚Äôs current family separation policy doesn‚Äôt demand trading one form of child abuse for another. RT if you agree! #FamiliesBelongTogether.@RepCartwright is proud of how America‚Äôs labor unions improved the lives of people in his corner of Pennsylvania &amp; across America. It‚Äôs why he‚Äôs fighting to give Americans #ABetterDeal in the wake of the #Janus decision. https://t.co/1Jaj7eMiGePraying for everyone injured &amp; the families of those lost in today‚Äôs shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Congress has a responsibility to take action to prevent the tragedy of gun violence. Every day it fails to do so is a stain on our country.I am speaking with reporters here in the Capitol during what has been a very eventful week in Washington and our nation. https://t.co/MtCTqZEWW7I will be speaking live from the Capitol today at 10:30 am ET.

The future of our democracy is at stake. The people deserve a voice in a decision that could radically alter the course of American justice for decades. https://t.co/wIvTSM9gb0So-called moderate Republicans folded &amp; destroyed the best chance Congress had to provide a permanent legislative fix for our immigration system, &amp; all they have to show for it is a failed bill that would have sold out Dreamers, families, asylum seekers &amp; children at the border.America‚Äôs unions are the foundation of the middle class. The Supreme Court‚Äôs radical ruling in #Janus will impact working Americans‚Äô good-paying jobs, wages, health care, retirement and workplace conditions for years to come. https://t.co/db9zjnleLrThe Supreme Court‚Äôs radical #Janus ruling tramples over the freedom and basic rights of over 17 million public workers. This decision to reverse decades of precedent will have long-lasting impacts on all hard-working Americans. https://t.co/f2f0XEx7tK https://t.co/J0zpb57hN7No American should be denied coverage or forced to pay more for their health care simply because they have a pre-existing condition. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/nfZYj6uzlR.@RepJoeCrowley has been an unwavering champion for America‚Äôs working families for almost two decades.

Every day Congress fails to protect voting rights is a day that it has failed Americans. We have to take responsibility for preserving our democracy. #RestoreTheVoteIn the crucial months ahead, we must strive to make America beautiful again. Trump‚Äôs daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable. As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea. https://t.co/vlpqOBLK4REarlier this week, I visited our southern border with some of my Democratic colleagues. It was an experience we will never forget. https://t.co/Wuu4gXgtmPAll of us are just one diagnosis, one accident, one phone call away from needing pre-existing condition protections. And now, Republicans are using their #GOPTaxScam for the rich to drive a new lawsuit to destroy these life-saving protections. #ProtectOurCareBecause the law protects people with pre-existing conditions, Gladys didn‚Äôt have to worry whether her son‚Äôs asthma would label him ‚Äúuninsurable.‚Äù #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/OgF1aGcsObFolk-singer Buddy Mondlock got Hepatitis C from a blood transfusion after a car accident in 1981. After decades being turned away by insurers, pre-existing condition protections meant that he was able to get the coverage that eventually cured his illness. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/5tkJlk06YIInstead of wasting time on House Republicans‚Äô destructive &amp; partisan bill, we should follow the Senate and return to the bipartisan tradition of robust Farm Bills that meet the needs of farmers, producers and hungry families. https://t.co/J9ATv0OlL7Little Zoe was born w/ a congenital heart defect.

If you ask me, they deserve to know that Simon won‚Äôt be denied health coverage just because he happens to have cerebral palsy.

Throughout the day today, I‚Äôll be sharing stories from folks who would be affected. #ProtectOurCareFor six months we have watched as the #GOPTaxScam enriched wealthy shareholders, rewarded companies that send jobs overseas, &amp; drove up health insurance costs for working families.House Republicans are intent on labeling their anti-family immigration legislation as a ‚Äúcompromise.‚Äù It must be a compromise with the Devil, because it is *not* a compromise with Democrats.Republicans continue to be complicit in @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs atrocities. Instead of standing up for families, they are pushing bills that serve to advance his shameful ideas. #FamiliesBelongTogetherI will always be proud to know that during my time as Speaker, the House passed the #DREAMAct.It‚Äôs important for people to know how Republicans are using the #GOPTaxScam for the rich to attack protections for pre-existing conditions‚Äîso insurers can discriminate against Americans w/ asthma &amp; heart issues.I‚Äôm speaking with reporters during today‚Äôs weekly press conference. #FamiliesBelongTogether

You started this and can end it right now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Vura936JHK.@SecNielsen must resign. This is not an immigration issue, it is a humanitarian issue.

The fact that the President himself won‚Äôt sign it (because it isn‚Äôt *conservative* enough) is a sign of just how low his standards are. #ProtectDREAMersOne thing is clear to anyone reading the new @HouseGOP immigration bill: It is nothing more than a cruel codification of President Trump‚Äôs anti-immigrant agenda which fails to provide a permanent solution to #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/AARe6zfCCK https://t.co/Cbq040jhJN.@SenSchumer &amp; I will discuss the release of the DOJ Inspector General‚Äôs report on activities leading up to the 2016 presidential election.

The question we need to ask is: why wouldn‚Äôt we start the banquet with the middle class? #PelosiTownHallSmall businesses should be at the core of any effort to strengthen our economy.

Be sure to watch at 9 pm ET. #PelosiTownHall https://t.co/BZQHkTdaV6These young men &amp; their fellow students are a force to be reckoned with. Their command of facts &amp; arguments on the topic of ending gun violence should give us all hope for a safer future. #NeverAgain https://t.co/uTNf9cKoKD.@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs domestic gag rule, announced today, threatens the ability of millions of American women to access the basic health care &amp; contraception that is so important to their daily lives.Tough talk from a man separating innocent children from their parents https://t.co/vregqsTtVnLooking forward to joining @ChrisCuomo for tomorrow‚Äôs #PelosiTownHall on CNN. Things will kick off at 9 pm ET! https://t.co/g4hQyfJCsCThe #DoddFrankRollBack would open the doors to banks once again discriminating in how they lend to home buyers. We should be taking steps to move forward, not making the situation worse.Harvey‚Äôs tireless leadership, impassioned advocacy for justice &amp; equality remind us all that we must never settle for mere tolerance, but that all Americans, regardless of who they are or love, are deserving of acceptance &amp; respect. #HarveyMilkDay https://t.co/C56gQuiQVU https://t.co/S783GMGt4XThis is inexcusable. We should be doing more to help Mayor @LibbySchaaf and others like her as they work to keep Americans safe ‚Äì not punishing their efforts to ensure their communities are exercising their rights. https://t.co/jhP9bZFkplWith #ABetterDeal, we will:
-Raise teacher wages
-Protect teachers‚Äô freedom to negotiate for better wages
-Invest in our crumbling schools

https://t.co/qQvyOvOlJ6If we want our teachers ‚Äì and our children ‚Äì to succeed, we *must* give them the tools they need. That is the only path to improving our education system. #ABetterDeal https://t.co/QJ8qTkwj7E.@SenSchumer &amp; I will unveil Democrats‚Äô plan for ‚Äú#ABetterDeal for Teachers &amp; Students‚Äù at 12 noon ET.

Read my op-ed with @SenSchumer: https://t.co/1qAuPbRI3pWe must not allow the GOP Congress to drag us back to the same lack of oversight that ignited the 2008 financial crisis. I join @RepMaxineWaters in urging Members to vote against the Dodd-Frank Rollback bill on the House floor tomorrow. https://t.co/LN2roT91NwHouse &amp; Senate Democrats came together on the steps of the US Capitol to take a stand against the culture of corruption in Trump‚Äôs Washington. #ABetterDeal https://t.co/wqgQQxHaTGToday‚Äôs Supreme Court ruling picks corporations over people. The middle class was built on giving hardworking families a real voice. Now, a decision by five justices takes away the rights of millions of workers fighting discrimination, sexual harassment &amp; wage theft. #epicsystemsBut our plan to bring better jobs, better wages, and a better future to American families goes so far beyond that. #ABetterDeal

Read all of the proposals here: https://t.co/2CPXlViyQ8Today we released our #ABetterDeal proposal to:

You are all at the forefront of a watershed moment in history. Never doubt your ability to make a better future for us all. https://t.co/gnMNSRouRLFor months, @realDonaldTrump has insulted &amp; tried to discredit the men &amp; women at FBI &amp; DOJ in self-serving attempts to distract from the Trump-Russia scandal. His conspiratorial fantasies must not be allowed to undermine the proper function of our justice system. https://t.co/TJ3yes0FqhThe Trump Admin‚Äôs continued failure to ensure steady, qualified leadership across the VA has undermined its ongoing transformation of care for our nation‚Äôs veterans. It is yet another troubling sign of the White House‚Äôs ultimate goal of VA privatization. https://t.co/CvebxSzeGr https://t.co/Lft3roZTLZIf you are looking to understand how the #GOPFarmBill failed Americans ‚Äì and why Democrats voted against it ‚Äì you should take a moment to watch @RepMarciaFudge‚Äôs weekly address. https://t.co/Z5opPcXEIWThe House just rejected a #GOPFarmBill which failed the millions of Americans working in agriculture &amp; the millions more who are food insecure. Republicans should now come to the table, return to a historic, bipartisan tradition &amp; negotiate in good faith. https://t.co/PLh3JnpZmF https://t.co/wIsLzDTTVGI am closely following reports out of Texas in the wake of today‚Äôs awful shooting. My heart is with the students &amp; all who are waiting to hear from loved ones. Deeply thankful for our heroic first responders. Congress has a duty to take action to save lives. #neveragainThe @HouseGOP continues to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the #GOPFarmBill. Punishing working families who are already struggling to afford food doesn‚Äôt do anyone any good. https://t.co/oCEA0ulwdoMy message at #MomsSummit is simple: know your power. The ability of women &amp; girls to improve their communities should never be in doubt.All too often, discussions about #SNAP don‚Äôt recognize how it improves the lives of the *people* who receive benefits. @RepBRochester has lived that story first hand.

The strength they‚Äôve shown these past years ‚Äî and the determination to protect other families from experiencing the pain they‚Äôve felt ‚Äî inspires us all to fight for justice. https://t.co/JWfyeY7cBg.@SpeakerRyan, bring up a vote to protect #NetNeutrality immediately. Americans have made it clear they want to #SaveTheInternet. Ignoring them would be an affront to our democracy.Truly exhilarating to see effort to #SaveTheInternet pass the Senate. Now it‚Äôs time for @SpeakerRyan to allow a vot‚Ä¶ https://t.co/RMgSSQDztN#NetNeutrality is key to ensuring America ‚Äì and American workers ‚Äì stay on top in the years to come. Encouraging to see the Senate recognize that fact. It‚Äôs time for @SpeakerRyan &amp; @HouseGOP to take steps to #SaveTheInternet.RETWEET if you think Big Business should not have an unfair advantage over small businesses trying to make their mark! #SaveTheInternet #NetNeutrality https://t.co/YIwSm1XaAN#NetNeutrality means you can use the internet how you (not some company) see fit ‚Äì even if that‚Äôs debating about #Yanny &amp; #Laurel. #SaveTheInternet

(It‚Äôs ‚ÄúLaurel‚Äù, by the way)Americans have made it clear they are worried about rising prescription drug prices ‚Äì and it‚Äôs no wonder. They deserve #ABetterDeal which will let Medicare negotiate for lower prices &amp; cut costs for working families.From the first day of his campaign, @realDonaldTrump promised to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma. And now, after months of delay, he has pulled his punch on fighting rising prescription drug costs. #BrokenPromisesIt‚Äôs time for @SpeakerRyan to finally hold the classified briefing Members need on the steps being taken to #ProtectOurDemocracy against interference in our elections.

Read my letter to him here: https://t.co/UIEi9UmbdRHere in our Capitol Hill community, we will never forget the loss of USCP Officer Jacob Chestnut &amp; Detective John Gibson 20 years ago, nor the heroism of David Bailey &amp; Crystal Griner in protecting our friends &amp; colleagues last year. #NationalPoliceWeekEvery year, we take a moment to honor the memory &amp; sacrifice of the police officers who have lost their lives in service to public safety, &amp; thank their families for sharing these brave men &amp; women with our communities. #PeaceOfficersMemorialDay https://t.co/9JgQ8uhnNYAs American Muslims come together across the nation to celebrate #Ramadan, we hope this sacred time brings the blessings of joy, peace and wisdom. https://t.co/YTXwO0nkH6 https://t.co/KPce9SUkAnThe #GOPFarmBill only makes SNAP better if you define ‚Äúbetter‚Äù as jeopardizing benefits for nearly 2 million people or 265,000 children losing their free school meals. 
 
Then again, @HouseGOP also thought #Trumpcare and #GOPTaxScam were good ideas. #SNAPmatters https://t.co/JTLdDRnplUWishing the very best to @RepAnthonyBrown. Rest up &amp; we‚Äôll see you back in the People‚Äôs House soon!Republicans need to stop lying about the *actual* focus of their #GOPTaxScam (wealthiest 1 percent &gt; seniors &amp; families). Any guesses on how fast @SpeakerRyan tries to spin this as helping the Middle Class? https://t.co/zZtvUb4nRa.@FLOTUS, hope that you are comfortable &amp; best wishes for a speedy recovery!.@realDonaldTrump is focused on helping create jobs in China for a company that threatens US national security.

Watch here at 12 pm ET: https://t.co/IDXHtUKhR9The #JCPOA was one of the great diplomatic achievements of our time ‚Äî in no small part because we were able to gain the support China &amp; Russia to rein in Iran. By abandoning this historic agreement, Trump is putting the threat of a nuclear Iran back on the table..@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs decision to abandon the #JCPOA is no substitute for real global leadership. https://t.co/q37awjcq3tPresident Trump‚Äôs decision to abandon the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action will ultimately isolate America, not Iran.

Dems want to make middle class tax cuts permanent. https://t.co/Bw5qGvgKkQWhile GOP plans to eliminate children‚Äôs health funding to pay for #GOPTaxScam, Dems want to strengthen the middle class tax cuts &amp; make them permanent. Changes to the tax code must be bipartisan, transparent &amp; focused on creating jobs, promoting growth &amp; reducing the deficit.Wonderful to join @RepEspaillat in welcoming @davidortiz to Washington for #SemanaDominicana! https://t.co/nHRmktewWjThankful to the @OfficialCBC for always being the conscience of the Congress &amp; standing up for equal justice under the law. #CBCDemandsJusticeToday is a sad day for America‚Äôs global leadership.  The Trump Administration‚Äôs dangerous &amp; impulsive action is no substitute for real global leadership.Democrats have no illusions about the Iranian regime. We remain strongly committed to stopping the advancement of Iran‚Äôs ballistic missile program, its egregious human rights abuses, &amp; its support of terrorism &amp; other nefarious activities in the region..@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs decision to abdicate American leadership during a critical moment in our effort to advance a denuclearization agreement with North Korea is particularly senseless, disturbing &amp; dangerous.The President's decision to follow his misguided &amp; uninformed campaign promise to destroy the successful JCPOA endangers global security &amp; defies comprehension.Experts &amp; our allies all agree that this landmark agreement has been successful in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, &amp; even senior Trump Administration officials have confirmed that Iran has remained in compliance of the agreement.The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is a great diplomatic achievement. Yet, the President has chosen to utterly ignore that reality.This rash decision isolates America, not Iran. https://t.co/u1GOUP6wBR https://t.co/cf8xRi9vWXBeing thankful for our teachers is not enough.

Our Founders knew that a more unified America makes for a stronger America. #PlaybookInterviewWhether it‚Äôs separating immigrant children from their families or stealing from funds dedicated to children‚Äôs health to pay for the #GOPTaxScam, there is an ever-widening gap between the beliefs Republicans claim to hold &amp; the policies they seek to enact. #PlaybookInterviewBut it goes beyond that: anyone who has looked at prices for the goods &amp; services working families depend on, it‚Äôs clear we need to lower costs &amp; boost the buying power of workers. #ABetterDeal #PlaybookInterview https://t.co/oZqt3kBgLOPutting an end to wage stagnation is central to any effort to reinvigorate our economy &amp; plan for the future.

In all his years of service, I‚Äôve never received a complaint from our Members about him pastoring to the needs of the House.Father Pat Conroy‚Äôs service for the last seven years has been a blessing of grace &amp; dignity to the House. It is truly sad that, knowing he did not have the power to fire him, @SpeakerRyan decided to force Father Conroy out by demanding his resignation.House Intel Republicans‚Äô fundamentally flawed final report on Russia is the result of a fundamentally flawed investigation.
