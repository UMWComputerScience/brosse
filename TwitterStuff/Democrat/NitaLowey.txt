Cutting funding to these programs undermines U.S. international development goals, hurts women &amp; girls, and is, quite simply, an ineffective and bad decision.Year after year, we must remind our Republican colleagues about the critical importance of international reproductive health services. And once again, the majority has severely cut funding to these life-saving programs.I support @RepTimRyan’s amendment to restore funding for bilateral family planning and reproductive health efforts to the FY 2018 level.Because the US neither can -- nor should -- provide assistance to every country, our partnership with UNFPA extends our reach to millions more women than we could alone.... Today’s global challenges are enormous.  The US must not cut itself off from its most effective partners.UNFPA not only provides family planning services; it leads efforts to eliminate the practice of sex-selection; prevent gender-based violence; and provide safe delivery kits for childbirth.I support @RepBarbaraLee’s amendment to FY19 SFOPS appropriations bill.  UNFPA works in 3x as many countries as USAID, including many places where no other service providers are available.The elimination of reproductive health from these annual reports indicates the U.S. is retreating from our historic role as a leader on women’s equality.These annual reports provide lawmakers and policy experts with critical information about how countries are respecting the human rights – including reproductive rights – of the most marginalized populations.I’m leading @AppropsDems at full committee markup of FY19 State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill... I support @RepKClark’s amendment that directs @StateDept to resume annual reporting on reproductive rights in their Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.It is almost always better to stay at a negotiating table than to walk away. By walking away from this deal, the President has given up our leverage on Iran, allowing it to further provoke chaos in the Middle East, and weakened our standing in the world. https://t.co/x4B8N9CS83We’re at full committee markup of FY19 SFOPS appropriations bill... I agree with @rosadelauro: @realDonaldTrump’s family separation policy is child abuse.The House majority rejected my amendment to strike the expanded Global Gag Rule as well as the ban on funding for the United Nations Population Fund. Democrats will keep fighting to best serve men, women, and children in need!We cannot, under any circumstance, allow this policy to be codified into law, as it will hit the most vulnerable the hardest, including those who are unable to access services due to stigma, poverty, violence, or HIV status.This destructive policy endangers our most successful global health programs.  While we are just beginning to learn the impact of the expanded policy, the alarm bells are already ringing.In closing, my amend doesnt change long-standing prohibition on funding for abortions.  It simply allows aid recipients the ability to use their own resources, within the legal constraints of their countries, as they deem necessary to best serve men, women, and children in need.The lives saved from our work in maternal health, HIV, malaria or other diseases should be a source of pride for every U.S. citizen.  Inserting the #GGR into all global health programs will diminish effectiveness of this work &amp; reduce our country’s role as a global health leader.My amendment does not change any of the current provisions in law that restrict the use of family planning funds. It would simply ensure that countries are setting their own health policies – not the United States.Under this expanded policy:
o Her doctor can’t have a factual convo about her health w/o worrying if even a simple convo would risk entire clinic’s funding.
o Her kids’ doctors have to sign onto a policy regarding abortion before discussing handwashing or providing immunizations.We have seen this in our travels.  When I was in Cambodia in 2001, I met a woman, thin as a rail, when she came into a U.S. funded clinic with six or seven malnourished children trailing behind her.  And she was noticeably pregnant with her next...One provider has estimated that approximately 2 million women will be denied reproductive health services as a result of the expanded policy.We already know the Global Gag Rule, when only applied to family planning programs, hurts the health of men, women, and children. The expansion to all global health without knowing the precise impact is not only bad policy, it jeopardizes lives.Meanwhile, mass confusion about the policy has led to a chilling effect, causing organizations to unnecessarily change or eliminate vital health services.While the Administration is still “assessing” the impact, reports indicate that thousands of women have lost access to services from the most experienced providers who have been forced to close their doors.The Administration implemented this policy with NO analysis of its impact and has admitted there could be unanticipated effects.It is unconscionable to tie up $8.8 billion in global health assistance by inserting abortion politics into activities such as lifesaving nutrition programs and efforts to prevent and treat malaria, TB, and HIV.House bill shortchanges basic family planning &amp; health services, leaving women vulnerable to preventable diseases &amp; weakening their ability to achieve econ stability for themselves &amp; families.  Particularly egregious is expansion of   GGR to ALL global health assistance.Offering my amendment now. It would strike the expanded Global Gag Rule as well as the ban on funding for the United Nations Population Fund.My amendment to FY19 State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill - &amp; other @AppropsDems amendments being offered - all boil down to one core value: a woman's fundamental right to plan her family and her future.  https://t.co/pLbQoKrOBCI’ll offer an amendment on #GGR to the FY 19 State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill that’s being marked up now. Preview here: https://t.co/pLbQoKrOBC @thehillI’m leading @AppropsDems at markup of FY 2019 State and Foreign Ops appropriations bill. ICYMI - @RepBarbaraLee, @RepTimRyan, @RepKClark, &amp; I published an op-ed in @thehill about the admin’s war on women’s health &amp; amendments we’re offering to the bill. https://t.co/pLbQoKrOBCIn the FY 2018 omnibus, Congress rejected the dangerous riders and funding levels before us today. Democrats cannot support a bill if it would mean turning our backs to the world’s most vulnerable women or the looming threat of climate change.If we are not successful, I will regrettably have to oppose the bill at this stage.Over the 28 years I’ve been privileged to work on these issues, I have always tried to keep contentious issues out of the bill. In the end, D votes will be needed to pass. I will offer amendments today with many of my colleagues to remove the controversial riders from the bill...But the mark would slash investments in bilateral family planning, codify the Global Gag Rule and its expansion into ALL global health, and prohibit U.S. contributions to UNFPA. These policies hurt vulnerable women and severely decrease the efficiency of U.S. aid programs.I find it hard to believe we’re still arguing over importance of intl. family planning &amp; reproductive health programs. Studies show access 2 modern contraceptives not only prevents unwanted pregnancies, abortions, &amp;  maternal deaths, it’s also key to gender equality &amp; econ growthUnfortunately, this bill contains a number of short-sighted poison pills, from denying climate change to renewed attacks on women’s health.  These onerous riders would make the world less safe, hurt the most vulnerable, and reduce the effectiveness of U.S. development.Further, this bill contains funding for the International Organizations and Programs account, recognizing that U.S. support for UN agencies gives taxpayers the best return on investment.On the positive side, this bill maintains unwavering, bipartisan support and robust funding for our close ally Israel, and provides funding for other critical partners, such as Jordan, and for development goals in many of the world’s poorest countries.We would be more secure and garner more goodwill if, instead of the Republican plan to waste hundreds of millions of dollars on Trump’s border wall and deportation force, we increased our investments in diplomacy and other security assistance in this bill.For example, the unparalleled refugee crisis, numerous countries on the brink of famine, and ongoing threats to U.S. national security demand a more robust response from U.S. global leadership.While the bill before us avoids the Administration’s irresponsible FY 2019 proposal to cut our diplomatic and development efforts, with an $18 billion increase in discretionary spending for FY 2019, we could, and should, invest more than 1% of the budget in our overseas efforts.While I appreciate bipartisan process, I’m disappointed in allocation &amp; several policy provisions in FY19 foreign aid bill. It’s funded @ same level as FY18, should be at least equal to Senate’s increase of $400m to recognize we can’t further risk US leadership abroad.We’re getting started. Tune in now.
