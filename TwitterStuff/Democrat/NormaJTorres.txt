In the U.S., for every $1 a man is paid, Latinas are paid just 54 cents, African American women are paid 63 cents, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women are paid 87 cents. #EqualPayDayUnequal pay hurts our communities and the economy. Working mothers have less money to pay for their groceries, rent, and childcare. This is unacceptable. #EqualPayDayOne of my first jobs was in a male-dominated industry selling steel. It didn't matter if I performed well, if not better, than my male counterparts. I still was paid significantly less. #EqualPayDayIn California, women make 88 cents for every $1 a man makes. In my district that means, a woman will earn $32,279 a year compared to $36,934 for men. #EqualPayDayOn #EqualPayDay, we join with millions of American women to demand equal pay for an equal day's work.#Selfie thanks for supporting our hardworking #LAPD Dispatchers @BeverlyNBCLA https://t.co/0GOkIZmSqM.@RepEliotEngel and I have been asking questions about drug money and @Trump Panama hotel.

Nearly 18K Dreamers have lost protection since. #SOTULet‚Äôs not get distracted by the shiny object @realDonaldTrump calls his immigration plan. This isn‚Äôt about securing our country, it‚Äôs about strictly limiting who gets to come in and who doesn‚Äôt. #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAboutRepublican leadership and @realDonaldTrump have no interest in fixing our immigration system.

If @realDonaldTrump was serious about fixing our immigration system &amp; helping America grow, then he wouldn't have ended Protected Status for over 300K tax-paying LEGAL immigrants. #SOTUIn his Republican nomination acceptance speech, @realDonaldTrump said,‚ÄúWe will build the roads, bridges, tunnels, airports  and the railways of tomorrow.‚Äù A $1.5 trillion plan is not a viable, nor serious solution to our crumbling infrastructure. #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs infrastructure only invests $1.5 trillion in 10 years. Perhaps, if Republicans weren‚Äôt too busy giving $1.5 trillion in tax breaks for millionaires, we could actually double our investment in our infrastructure.  #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAboutDemocrats understand the rising costs of premiums and drug prices, but the solution is to improve our current healthcare system, not completely repeal it. #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout  #SOTUFor a year, Republicans were focused on crafting their #GOPTaxScam and repealing provisions of the ACA, neglecting funding for the opioid epidemic, Community Health Centers, veterans and CHIP. #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAboutHow are they paying for this #GOPTaxScam?
