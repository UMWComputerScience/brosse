With the future of H visas at stake under the Trump Admin., small businesses could be hit hardest by visa cuts. https://t.co/C8m1QzecKzWomen are using their voices to speak out against @realDonaldTrump’s child separation policy.

That's why I join the call to #AbolishIce. On every front, we must fight @realDonaldTrump's policies like "zero tolerance", jeopardizing DREAMers and rolling back #TPSThe most powerful nation on earth is now requiring three year-olds who have fled violence to defend themselves alone in court. Let that sink in. #ReuniteTheFamilies https://t.co/UTyc7Cx1xtToday at 2 pm I'll be meeting with Lawyer Moms of America and @JoAnneSimonBK52 regarding our shared opposition to Trump's hateful "zero tolerance" policy and separation of parents from children   Media welcome! Please join us at Steps of Brooklyn Borough Hall. @lawyer_momsMy heart is with the @capgaznews staff and community of Annapolis after a horrifying and senseless act of gun violence. As we wait for more information, one thing is clear—Congress must pass legislation to tackle America’s epidemic of mass shootings.We cannot forget that at this moment, thousands of children are wondering when they will finally be reunited with their parents. I’m sending a message to all the responsible federal agencies—there is no time to waste. https://t.co/SkVkk82YdBThis week, I had the privilege to meet with young @CHCI #R2LNextGen participants from Puerto Rico, part of the next generation of leaders.

Proud to receive your 2018 Music Education Champion award. https://t.co/U0jYF1jNceGrowing up in Puerto Rico, I badly wanted to take music lessons but it was a stretch for my family to afford.

He agreed that lead &amp; mold pose serious health risks so why did he &amp; @realdonaldtrump want to eliminate all funding for the Public Housing Capital Fund, which pays for repairs? https://t.co/ZLnqLHxwFO@LynnePattonHUD @GlennThrush @NYCHA @SecretaryCarson Thanks for responding, but I'm not sure it takes a round table to explain why your boss and @realDonaldTrump proposed cutting all funds from HUD's public housing capital fund. I'll look forward to Dr. Carson's response.@LynnePattonHUD @GlennThrush @NYCHA That still doesn't answer the very simple question I asked your boss - why did the Trump Administration's budget propose zeroing out the public housing capital fund if they know there are public health concerns that need to be addressed? Can you ask Dr. Carson to get back to me?Throughout our history, unions have won battles to improve working conditions and give workers a seat at the table. Today’s #JanusvAfscme ruling delivers a major blow to the ability of unions to fairly represent their workers. We must stand with our union brothers and sisters.The #JanusvAfscme ruling betrays workers and abandons 40 years of legal precedent empowering collective bargaining. We must instead strengthen unions to make sure that all NYers can achieve the American dream. #UnionStrongThis morning’s #JanusvAfscme ruling further rigs the system against working people by giving more power to corporations &amp; draining union resources. I’ll fight back to defend unions so that workers have the means to negotiate for fair working conditions. #UnionStrong https://t.co/AE3HHlCDHRWe've heard many calls for civility recently from @WhiteHouse &amp; @realDonaldTrump. I'll always maintain civility - as I oppose policies that denigrate women, rip children from parents' arms, terrorize our immigrant neighbors and castigate people of color. I'll resist. Civilly.The future of the internet is at stake in the fight against the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality. I am proud to sign my name on the House petition to force a vote.#NetNeutrality protects small businesses and innovators in our district by ensuring they have a level playing field online. The Trump @FCC’s repeal has gut those protections. #SaveTheInternetToday’s #NIFLAvBecerra ruling enables unlicensed centers that are designed to intimidate and shame women seeking healthcare and exercising their fundamental reproductive rights. This is unacceptable and we must continue standing for a woman’s right to choose.The Equality Act would extend existing civil rights protections to #LGBTQ people by prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity across key areas of life. I join @HRC in urging my colleagues to pass this vital legislation today. #EqualityForward https://t.co/tt0JjrBgLhThe Trump @FCC repealed #NetNeutrality, but the fight for a free and open internet continues.

But now, millions of Americans are denied this freedom. It’s time for Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE so we have a government of, by, and for the people.5 years after the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v.

These are the questions that immigrant mothers and fathers asking right now. We want to see these families reunited. https://t.co/qY56C8PSG6President Trump's cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reuniting them. Even worse, they deported some moms and dads before they were able to recover their children. This can't stand!

Tune in to watch our conversation. https://t.co/xcR6vJ49XTJoining MSNBC at 6 pm to discuss child separation at border. Tune in!Xiuqing You should never have been detained by ICE. That being said, I’m glad he'll be released from custody &amp; reunited with his wife and young children. I'll continue to fight on behalf of those targeted by Trump's deportation machine. These practices have no place in our City!The #GOPFarmBill robs children of meals and punishes their hardworking families. All this after @HouseGOP scrambled and failed to address @realDonaldTrump’s family separation policies. I am confounded as to how the GOP can claim the mantle of the party of family values. https://t.co/MFDrcCxDsRThe GOP's HR 4760 is not only heartless, it’s reckless. It would jeopardize the livelihoods of countless families &amp; drastically reduce legal immigration, costing New York state alone over $17 billion in economic output. America is a land of immigrants and we are better than this!Let me be clear—I will be voting NO on the two hard line anti-immigrant GOP bills on the House floor today. These bills further hurt children at the border by gutting basic protections and even reduce legal immigration. They are shameful.Every child deserves the benefits that come from learning music in the classroom.

My thanks today to the airlines who pledged not to be used in Trump's policy of family separation @AmericanAir, @united, @FlyFrontier https://t.co/IoBKCqRKJfI think "apropos" is what they call this. 

 https://t.co/vidC9NM5qz2/2 But for children ripped from their parents, the trauma is done, for families separated there is no guarantee of reunification.  The entire "zero tolerance" policy must be ended.  We must not rest until families are back together.  And the President should apologize.  Shameful1/2 .@realDonaldTrump created a crisis with a new policy of detaining children, claimed he needed Congress to act to solve it, then signed an insufficient Exec. Order, claiming he's solved the problem.This was always a Trump-created crisis. Proud to stand with @NancyPelosi and @HouseDemocrats to support the Keep Families Together Act. A bill that not only keeps families together but treats those who come to our borders looking for a better life with basic humanity. https://t.co/uUycn904LvThe #Trump Admin's “zero tolerance” policy to prosecute asylum-seeking families is the reason why children are being taken from their parents &amp; @FSCDems want answers. Today we asked an #ICE official why his colleagues fail to realize that #FamiliesBelongTogether. cc: @DHSGovToday, shortly after @HouseDemocrats introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, @FSCDems pressed #ICE Deputy Assistant Director Greg Nevano on his agency’s efforts to separate families at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogetherBack in Washington, we are fighting to #KeepFamiliesTogether. This morning, I was joined by these bright young faces and colleagues like @RepJayapal as we stood outside the Capitol demanding an end to @realDonaldTrump’s #ZeroTolerancePolicy. https://t.co/3e8hQHUtDlEvery second @realDonaldTrump fails to end his policy that is ripping families apart, children are suffering at the hands of our government. I’ve traveled to these detention centers, seen the terror in these children’s faces. We cannot wait, it must end! My floor speech: https://t.co/uiML9IqRPbAt 9:00 am, I will join a group of House Dems speaking about the children being separated from their families at the border.  Watch on C-SPAN.Let’s be clear @realDonaldTrump has the power to end his cruel family separation policy. Where he’s failed, Congress must intervene. That’s why I’ve cosponsored @RepJerryNadler’s Keep Families Together Act. @HouseGOP must show some moral courage and join Dems to get it passed! https://t.co/3HxcJj4v74Four first ladies from both political parties have expressed their outrage over families being separated at the border under @realDonaldTrump. This is not a red or blue issue. It’s about how our government is abusing children. #KeepFamilesTogether  https://t.co/01QlUOGtu9.@realDonaldTrump did not get elected to commit child abuse. #EndFamilySeperation #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/x0HZEsTBi1Today marks the moment when, 153 years ago the news of emancipation finally reached slaves in some of the deepest parts of the Confederacy.

This immoral policy must end immediately.  Watch the full video here: https://t.co/hePL8RAHodOur government cannot keep detaining immigrants like Xiuqing You, a Queens father who was just detained by ICE when he appeared for his green card interview. My statement. https://t.co/Uhe426rgAzLeaving first facility. Only way to describe the situation is heart wrenching. 64 boys detained there.  We are not allowed to take photos of the facilities - inside or out. Below is a photograph from the bus. On our way to an adult detention center.  Will keep sending updates. https://t.co/vfHFynxYLQI won’t rest until this abhorrent practice is stopped and children are reunited with their families. We need compassionate, commonsense immigration laws that reflect America’s basic values and commitment to immigrants!Trump’s DHS @SecNielsen says this is not the Administration’s policy—FALSE. Trump’s 100% criminal prosecution policy for asylum seekers is what is separating children from their parents.Instead? Trump is blaming Democrats and playing politics with the lives of children who are suffering at the hands of the U.S. government. #EndFamilySeparationHow did we get to this? The Trump Administration put in place a “zero-tolerance” policy that is separating children as young as 12 months old from their parents as a form of deterrence and punishment. @realDonaldTrump could end this TODAY.TODAY: I’m at the border in San Diego to demand that @realDonaldTrump end his heartless policies that are tearing families apart at the border. Time permitting I’ll try to provide updates here. Let’s get some facts straight first. THREAD 🔽Happy #FathersDay to all the dads in #NYC and around the country. Let’s also take a minute today to reflect on the fathers who’ve been inhumanely separated from their children at the border. We must take action now to stop these atrocities.Another example of the dangers K2 poses to our community especially in #Brooklyn. This is why I have authored legislation to deploy federal resources to combat this scourge and help address this pressing public health problem.

That’s only HALF of the summer break! We need to pass the Child Care For Working Families Act so families can afford #summercare!Thanks to the #ACA, health insurance companies CANNOT deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

Congress must start by passing commonsense reforms to rid weapons of war from our streets, schools and other public places. #EnoughisEnoughOne year ago, @realDonaldTrump pulled out of the #ParisAccord making one of the most consequential decisions to walk back America’s commitment to fighting climate change. He must reverse course immediately and recognize our role in protecting our shared future. #WeAreStillInDuring #PrideMonth we pay homage to the struggles and triumphs that have defined #LGBTQ history in America. My statement on the strides we’ve made and the path that awaits us towards achieving full equality for all Americans, regardless of who they are or whom they love. https://t.co/uSNaScCvQyIt’s no secret that the temporary pop-up pool is a treasured destination for families in Brooklyn. However, New Yorkers deserve the assurance that summers will bring a place to relax and swim. Thrilled to join @bbpnyc to announce plans to build a permanent pool at Squibb Park. https://t.co/7tqiq0m13jProud to #WearOrange yesterday as we gear up Saturday's #WearOrangeWeekend for a national day of action for to call for an end to gun violence! https://t.co/u9Ir9pFuwX.@DHSgov Secretary Nielsen wants you to believe that these stories are one-offs, but @ICEgov and @CBP have separated hundreds of children from their parents. #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/uubfH0YT68Forced family separation is not only traumatic but impacts ability for both parents &amp; children to seek legal protection while apart. This reckless practice interferes with due process and is really just cruel. https://t.co/aCS4drhZvvFamily unity is recognized as a fundamental human right, enshrined in international law. The Trump Administration’s proposal and subsequent actions to separate immigrant families flies in the face of this norm. It must stop. https://t.co/5m8qyytOD7ICE must immediately offer an explanation for how a transgender woman, Roxana Hernandez died in their custody. For the trans community and esp. trans people of color, violence and abuse is horrifically too common. My heart goes out to Roxana's loved ones.  https://t.co/WzKyi3bmIAWhen we talk about reducing gun violence, we must pay attention to how these tragedies are especially too common for communities of color. Whether in our parks, streets or schools, we must take action. Proud to see Brooklyn students fighting for change: https://t.co/UOPGkwwwIYWatch my conversation with @KateBolduan in which I discuss my call for a government investigation into Puerto Rico’s true death toll. We must have this information to send proper resources and ensure that a botched federal response like #Maria NEVER happens again. https://t.co/bXuHuAsnvlBe sure to tune in to @CNN with @KateBolduan this hour where I will be discussing the alarming new death toll figures in Puerto Rico &amp; the need for a sustained federal response.TODAY at 12:30PM: Join me for an anti-gun violence community forum as we prepare for National Gun Violence Awareness #WearOrange Day. This is a chance to ask questions &amp; hear about ongoing efforts to keep our streets and schools safe. Miccio Community Center, 110 W 9th St, BKNo debió haber llegado al punto que una institución como Harvard tuviera que dar luz sobre lo que muchos puertorriqueños han estado enfrentando por 8+ meses. Es un precio alto a pagar por falta de atención médica necesaria. Vea la historia de Don José: https://t.co/o6rRNczwDeIt shouldn't have taken the weight of an institution like Harvard to shed light on what too many Puerto Ricans have been facing for 8+ months. The toll that a lack of medical care is taking on the lives of American citizens. Watch Don José’s story: https://t.co/o6rRNczwDeWe must get to the bottom of the disturbing and pervasive Chinese Consulate scam where hackers are targeting the identity of residents of Chinatowns in BK and Manhattan. That’s why I wrote to the @FTC urging a focus on the issue &amp; answers. More:  https://t.co/sLQee9tjCAThere is no law requiring DHS to separate families at the border. It is a choice by the Trump administration. FACT CHECK: https://t.co/XCPAN06Z5mPleased to hear that more funding will be allocated for the cleanup of the Gowanus Canal. In Congress, I’m fighting to impose a tax on big oil and chemical companies to raise additional Superfund cleanup revenue and hold polluters accountable. https://t.co/YTwhiIIKQ8Proud to stand w/ @NYCMayor @NYC_DOT &amp; @NYC_SafeStreets to advance new safety measures in Park Slope. Too many parents like Amy Cohen have lost their children at dangerous intersections. We owe it to our community to improve the safety of our neighborhood streets. https://t.co/wdyxDkArwo.@realDonaldTrump bragged that #Maria’s apparent low death count was a success for his Administration. Mr. President, it is now being reported that at least 4,600 people lost their lives from #Maria in Puerto Rico. You owe them an apology and action. https://t.co/vZwwYXrK2mA third of the est. 4,600+ deaths from #Maria were due to a delay or lack of medical care. America is the largest economy in the world. In the wake of this shattering new report, we cannot stop shedding light on the unethical disparities in Puerto Rico.  https://t.co/fGTJu9mEMeLast year, when the official #Maria death toll seemed alarmingly low, I joined with @BennieGThompson asking GAO to review. With a new report estimating 4,600+ fatalities in PR, we need an explanation and answers as to why the official death count remains so low. @HomelandDemsLooking for ways to voice the message of #WearOrange &amp; honor National Gun Violence Awareness Day? Tomorrow, I’m hosting a forum in Brooklyn to talk with students &amp; community members about efforts to end gun violence. Join me ➡️12:30pm, Miccio Community Center 110 W 9th St, BK.EVENT 🗓️: Leading up to #WearOrange day, on Thursday, 5/31 at 12:30 PM in Brooklyn, I’m hosting a forum to discuss efforts to reduce gun violence. I'll be joined by local students and gun control activists. I hope to see you there. Miccio Community Center,  110 W 9th St, BKRacism and bigotry have no place in our national discourse. Glad to see ABC taking action after Roseanne’s disgraceful words attacking @ValerieJarrett. https://t.co/UKOrwcut92.@realDonaldTrump you thought more people died from Katrina than from Maria? What do you say now that Harvard suggests more than 4,600 U.S. citizens perished in Puerto Rico from Maria? Will you now admit this is a "real catasrophe?" https://t.co/aHU7Wlo4i5My full statement on latest study on death toll in Puerto Rico is below. https://t.co/PM7KeMGlIjThis Memorial Day, let us all take time to honor those who served. We owe them a debt of gratitude and our profound thanks. https://t.co/42DHyQCBxmWe have an Administration that is separating children from parents and then, literally, losing them!  

This is shameful and beyond the pale even for this President. 

Is this how you Make America Great Again!? #WhereAreTheChildrenEPA Superfunds are labeled a priority for cleanup, but not if taxpayer funding dries up. That’s why I’ve proposed bringing back a tax on big oil &amp; chemical companies to hold polluters accountable &amp; fund the cleanup of sites like Wolff-Alport in Queens. https://t.co/mat4VtdynxAll students should have the support &amp; resources to thrive, no matter what their zip code is. That’s why I’m proud to join Democrats in Congress to propose #ABetterDeal for our students and teachers. Learn more: https://t.co/UVN1dRn6bsRepublicans must join with the majority of the American people who support #Dreamers and codifying #DACA into law. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/idcjljxwV9New Yorkers are familiar with the saying by Emma Lazarus “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” This is the message of America. 

@realDonaldTrump how dare you tear children from their families at the border? 

https://t.co/G4Ao108I3TSo saddened to hear of the passing of Angelo Falcon. A great mind, brilliant scholar, a leader in our community, he did so much to help Puerto Ricans &amp; New Yorkers. His data was vital to advancing progressive policies. RIP, friend. May we all take solace in his many contributionsProud that my amendments passed the House today in #NDAA. They'll help employees own a stake in their companies, increase federal contracts in PR and require gov’t oversight to study the health impacts of the US bombing range in #Vieques. Read more: https://t.co/aUxH5GTTJIRather than using hateful, divisive language, @realDonaldTrump should have met with some of the wonderful immigrant families that make NYC the greatest city in the world and make America, America! https://t.co/XCkRSJPIhb @repjoecrowleyTOMORROW, THURSDAY, 10 a.m. on Capitol Hill at House Triangle, I'll be joining @HispanicCaucus in calling for @BetsyDeVosED to retract her statement saying schools can locally determine whether to call ICE on undocumented immigrant students!Yesterday, the House passed my bill to close a decades old loophole and extend the same investor protections to the people of Puerto Rico that have long benefited those on the Mainland. Great article from @frontlinepbs: https://t.co/ONBTd50fM4Grateful to all the bright young people who dedicate themselves to public service by interning in my office. Today, we said farewell to Charles and Elsie with some delicious ice cream. Also pictured, former interns Liam and Mark! https://t.co/3a1wsKczF4Proud to support @HouseDemocrats’ #ABetterDeal for Our Democracy. Take a look here https://t.co/6xURYTEUoPThe Supreme Court has ruled that children have a right to attend our public schools—regardless of immigration status. @BetsyDeVosED's disturbing suggestion that schools can decide to report students to ICE will deter kids from school &amp; incite more fear. https://t.co/yiv8gSCgUmIf we are going to lift up women in society, we must actively work to stop sex discrimination. That's why I joined my colleagues to urge the Trump Administration to end their ramped up discrimination based on sex, gender identity and sexual orientation in our health care system. https://t.co/f0it9oX3fLAs the Top Democrat on @HouseSBCDems, I’ve heard many times that the #GOPTaxScam puts Wall Street over Main Street. America’s 30 million small businesses deserve #ABetterDeal. https://t.co/VNzMQMmDl7Proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Health Equity and Accountability Act which seeks to erase health disparities especially for women and communities of color. #HealthEquityNow

As we approach June 1st, the start of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, it is crucial that the Island has the resources to rebuild and recover sustainably. https://t.co/rGHKYLzK3HCheck out my latest video update to hear the latest of what's been happening in Washington. https://t.co/WKDrkevJaPI am opposing S.2155, legislation that would roll back many consumer protections in Dodd-Frank. However, I am pleased the bill does include legislation to protect investors in Puerto Rico by closing a decades old loophole.  My full statement is below. https://t.co/eGArYXaYpdThe #GOPTaxScam is a benefit to Wall Street at the expense of Main Street small businesses.  Americans and our entrepreneurs deserve real tax reform, not more unfairness and greater complexity!  @HouseSBCDems https://t.co/yDTY5DlUNZHeading to the floor to speak in opposition to S.2155, Republican legislation that would rollback many elements of Dodd-Frank!!“Hope will never be silent”—Harvey Milk. Today we honor the life of Harvey Milk, a man whose courage to live proudly profoundly lifted the voices of the #LGBTQ community. He would have been 88 today.This is utterly sickening and barbaric. What kind of a person seeks to ease restrictions on hunting bear cubs and swimming caribou? This @realDonaldTrump Administration decision must be strongly condemned and stopped immediately. https://t.co/akdQgf8V8UThe future of the internet is at stake in the fight against the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality. I am proud to sign my name on the House petition to force a vote.Let's be clear: the GOP bill to roll back Dodd-Frank provisions is NOT a bill to benefit small banks. It removes critical requirements on major Wall St. actors aimed at preventing another crisis like the 2008 meltdown.  I will be voting NO on S. 2155.So tragic to hear of the passing of @NYPD84Pct officers Michael Colangelo and John Martinez. Profoundly heartbreaking that Colangelo was killed on his wedding night. https://t.co/u1XYFQChoCThe @CFPB was designed to protect consumers from predatory practices, &amp; this includes protecting minorities from being unfairly targeted by lenders. Another shameful decision by @realDonaldTrump to open the doors to discrimination and unethical practices. https://t.co/Ie0tngaZJPAfter today's press event discussing our legislation to boost employee-owned businesses, Sen.

Anyone who says this debate is not about guns is willing to turn a blind eye to the senseless murdering of America’s children.

Maybe now, they'll try negotiating a real, bipartisan farm bill as has been previously done.Gut-wrenching news coming out of Santa Fe, Texas. Watching students flee their classrooms in fear after a shooting cannot become the new normal in this country. We owe it to all Americans to finally pass commonsense gun control. My heart is with the families #SantaFe.A hungry child cannot concentrate, cannot focus, cannot learn. Roughly 265,000 low-income kids will lose access to meals at school because of partisan #GOPFarmBill. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAPHouse Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn’t cut #SNAP. That’s not true. H.R. 2 cuts $9.2 billion in benefits to create unproven state workforce bureaucracies. I’m voting NO! #ProtectSNAPA stronger economy means embracing opportunities for all who dream of starting a business. This cannot exclude the #LGBTQ community and I’m glad that @SBAgov has heard my and @RepYvetteClarke's concerns &amp; restored their LGBTQ web resource pages: https://t.co/5WhpBysouR.@realDonaldTrump referring to immigrants as "animals" is an affront to our nation's values. Trump should choose his words more carefully. Remember, there's a specific animal many women associate him with. #GlassHouses64 years ago to this day, the Supreme Court unanimously declared school segregation to be unconstitutional. Today, we recommit to this fight by working to improve access to great schools for students of all backgrounds. #BrownvBoard.Deeply concerning reporting that the Trump Administration sought info on Haitian TPS recipients that’s irrelevant to the process of determining TPS status.
