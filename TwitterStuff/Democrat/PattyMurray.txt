Simply living or traveling near the border is not a sufficient reason to hassle or detain people in WA—proud to introduce legislation to limit warrantless searches near our national borders. https://t.co/dSiovDnkt9In Spokane &amp; across WA, this bill will help reset the balance between giving law enforcement the tools they need to protect the border &amp; protecting the rights of families &amp; communities who live or travel nearby our national borders https://t.co/dSiovDnkt9Justice Kennedy’s retirement comes at a time when so many of our values are under attack—we must keep making our voices heard to say we care about how people are treated in this country, we care about a woman’s freedom to make her own decisions. People nationwide need to be heard https://t.co/0vS1P8szceI want to be clear: Republican leaders should give families across the country the opportunity to weigh in, with an election, before moving forward to fill this seat.A right means nothing with the ability to exercise it, which is why we can’t remain silent as radical Republicans create new barriers to prevent women from making their own health care decisions. I won’t stop fighting, and I know women across the country won’t either.Two years ago, the Supreme Court once again affirmed the constitutional right of women to make decisions about their own body and future—including the right to safe, legal abortion. And I will not stop fighting to protect the progress we’ve made.There are plenty of commonsense things we can do to bring down health care costs, for example Washington state’s Medicaid Transformation is leading the way in developing innovative programs to provide higher quality care at lower cost.Let me be clear: women and men in this country understand how directly tied a woman’s freedom to make her own decision about her own body is to her economic security. And they overwhelmingly do not want to see that right rolled back. https://t.co/b5rGM7IIZ1One issue that I know women across the country will be focused on and asking about is their constitutionally protected right to control their own health care decisions, affirmed in Roe v. Wade.Voting rights are at stake. LGBTQ progress is at stake. The right to organize collectively is at stake. And those are just a few. There is so much more.People are going to want to know: will their rights be protected? Will their freedoms be secure? Will SCOTUS put people like them first or stand with special interests, big biz, and the most extreme ideologues in our country?I share the deep concern of so many families across this country who are already suffering under the Trump Administration and fear further erosion of the progress in this country.It is clear that Justice Kennedy’s retirement comes at a pivotal point in our nation’s history, when so many of our values are under attack by a president who has spent every day in office testing the limits of our Constitution.TUNE IN: https://t.co/Djvrng9kwG https://t.co/NqWRiH9N73Today, I was planning to speak on the Senate floor about a specific issue related to women’s health care, rights, and freedoms—but before I do that, I’m also going to speak on the news that is clearly very closely connected. -PMI’m heading to the Senate floor shortly to talk about Justice Kennedy’s retirement and what it means for so many women, people, and families across our country. -PMThe crisis of rising health care premiums was avoidable. We had a bipartisan deal to stabilize markets and lower costs, but Republican leaders refused to back it. When they're ready to put people before politics, I’m here at the table, ready to take much-needed action.Our economy only works when it works for everyone. Unions helped create the 40 hour workweek, workplace health and safety rules, child labor protections, and strengthen the middle class—and unions are still empowering workers in cities and states nationwide. https://t.co/O7t1qR9SapDemocrats are standing with unions and workers, and we’ll keep fighting to build an economy that works for all—not just those at the top. https://t.co/VThQpFC6RCBack home in Washington state, I’ve met far too many people struggling with skyrocketing drug prices, and rising insurance premiums. Our families are interested in solutions, not President Trump’s sabotage.Democrats will continue to stand up for workers and their right to be treated fairly on the job, and I urge all Republicans in Congress who claim to care about the economic security of the middle class to work with us to strengthen the rights of workers.For more than a century, unions have organized to lift up the voices of workers who were otherwise unheard, and fought for fair pay, safer working conditions, and better benefits.Today’s #SCOTUS decision is a loss for working people and yet another win for corporate special interests that have spent decades funding political campaigns and lawsuits designed to chip away at workers’ rights.About to discuss the impacts of President Trump’s health care sabotage at a HELP Committee hearing on soaring health costs and the need to reduce the burden on families. https://t.co/6PHmSzF1tXNote to President Trump &amp; Administration officials: 
 
Until every last one of the migrant kids you needlessly separated from their parents are reunited w their families—
 
We will not let up. 
 
We will not stop asking questions. 
 
We will not stop holding you accountable.I’m joining @SenatorDurbin’s call to encourage kids nationwide to show children who’ve been separated from their parents that we're thinking of them.

#cardsforkids https://t.co/tMsMGiaZoPOur government cannot forget its moral obligations to its people &amp; our communities. I will keep fighting to strengthen investments in important WA efforts like Hanford cleanup &amp; keep these priorities front and center on Congress’ agenda https://t.co/QfkEEBYznWDays later, and we’re still waiting on answers to these questions (&amp; so many more) from the Trump Administration about its reckless family separation policy: https://t.co/xNJtZ4Hs6FThank you, @hsdems! Great to talk with you today about how I got my start in politics and how we need to keep working together and making our voices heard. https://t.co/uCyp5aiEWgFrom protecting WA’s parks to maintaining our scenic trails, the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund not only helps protect our environment, but preserves our way of life.

Proud to help defend this important fund for the benefit of future generations. https://t.co/aSv3AOfjM0Fantastic news for Hanford cleanup—once again, Democrats &amp; Republicans were able to come together to reject President Trump’s senseless proposed cuts &amp; instead craft a budget that honors the sacrifices of central WA families https://t.co/QfkEEBYznWI’m pleased we were able to reach a bipartisan agreement to reauthorize a career and technical education law that helps workers and students get the skills they need to succeed in a changing economy. https://t.co/Op0KewNYoG.@SecAzar just said he can locate any child in the health department's custody within seconds. President Trump needs to reunite these families as quickly as possible and end this horrific crisis he created. https://t.co/M8GFgSM4iLTime and again President Trump has doubled down on his divisive rhetoric about refugees with policies that undermine critical humanitarian efforts and ignore the United States’ role as a world leader.I’m going to keep doing all I can to ensure that the front door of our nation remains open for anyone fleeing horrific violence and seeking to build a life in safety here in the United States—and urge President Trump to reverse his dangerous vision for America’s future.Our country has long stood as a symbol of hope and security for people around the world fleeing persecution and violence, and turning our backs on our global neighbors during one of the worst refugee crises in recent history flies in the face of who we are as a nation. https://t.co/aJGYrrpwQvWhile I’m so grateful that there are millions of people across this country who adamantly refuse to buy into President Trump’s hateful ruse, we cannot take this moment for granted—not for one second.We need to keep sending a message that the Trump Administration’s zero-tolerance policy is cruel, dehumanizing, and in no way represents what so many families in this country fight for every day.Thank you to everyone in WA for continuing to make your voices heard—especially those who came to my office on their last day of school to drop off cards &amp; letters they had collected from neighbors &amp; friends for families torn apart by Trump's zero-tolerance policy https://t.co/UTl4AZRCtiWe need to keep pushing hard for answers from President Trump &amp; @HHSGov about what will happen to the more than 2300 children already separated from their parents, like:
 
Are they safe?
 
Do their parents even know where they are?
 
And when will these families be reunited?Truth from @EverettHerald on Trump’s family separation policy: “….what it was another attempt by Trump to leverage a situation to get what he wanted: acquiescence from Democrats &amp; moderate Republicans in Congress to his terms on immigration reform…” https://t.co/lBGY8gN8YmPeople in WA &amp; across the nation will continue speaking out until President Trump &amp; his Administration finally address how they plan to reverse the incredible damage they’ve inflicted upon thousands of migrant children &amp; families. https://t.co/myGPicKU54Until President Trump unwinds the damage caused by his reckless, hateful family separation policy, absolutely none of this is OK.

Those of us on the right side of history won’t back down, &amp; we won’t stop raising our voices.Over the past several weeks, I have repeatedly requested details from @SecAzar &amp; @HHSGov officials regarding implementation of President Trump’s cruel and heartless policy of separating families arriving at the U.S. border. I’m not going to stop asking. https://t.co/DiqJSEsK9kAs families &amp; communities across the country face the tragedy of gun violence, National ASK Day is a reminder that simple steps can help save lives, which is why I have urged the Trump Administration to take immediate action to promote safe firearm storage. #AskingSavesKids https://t.co/p1RIORadSRToday is National ASK (#AskingSavesKids) Day, intended to remind guardians to ask if there are unlocked or loaded guns in places their children live and play. This simple question saves lives, and over 19 million parents have pledged to ask it. https://t.co/eeV3IfB36XWe need to keep pushing hard for answers from President Trump &amp; @HHSGov about what will happen to the more than 2300 children already separated from their parents, like:
 
Are they safe?
 
Do their parents even know where they are?
 
And when will these families be reunited?We need to keep sending a message that the Trump Administration’s zero-tolerance policy is cruel, dehumanizing, and in no way represents what so many families in this country fight for every day.While I’m so grateful that there are millions of people across this country who adamantly refuse to buy into President Trump’s hateful ruse, we cannot take this moment for granted—not for one second.Last year, GAO looked at programs to promote safe gun storage (like Lok-It-Up in King County) to better prevent gun-related harm, parents must safely store firearms so children do not encounter them in the first place. #AskingSavesLives https://t.co/6KzQIP41xRSince Columbine, over 210,000 students have experienced a shooting on campus–and 85% of the firearms used in these incidents have come from home or a family member. Safe gun storage and responsible firearm ownership are key to protecting our children. #AskingSavesKids https://t.co/yqDqZzDgacIf we can find hope in one thing, it is knowing that all the calls and emails and letters—all that outcry—got through to the President to change course on one of his most heartless policies yet. But we can’t let up now.President Trump has claimed for days that he needed Congressional action to do anything at all. Today, he proved that to be simply untrue.We are better than this. We must be better than this. Turning children into bargaining chips, or leverage points, or deterrents—that kind of cruelty should not be an option in our great nation. https://t.co/Rj4qRRjTERWe’re still digging into Trump’s EO, but here's what we know right now:
If implemented, there will continue to be zero tolerance for all asylum seekers, including domestic violence survivors, a system of locking up children by the thousands &amp; all carried out in our country’s nameWhile it’s a good thing President Trump dialed back his systematic child abuse—it’s not enough.
 
We are not going to say everything is OK, and we are not going to stay quiet.President Trump says his executive order stops the separation, but does that mean starting today? Next month? When? What about the thousands of children who were removed? Will they ever see their parents again, and if so, when? Where?Today we saw President Trump change his story about whether he did in fact have the ability to make it stop, but so many questions remain: How parents are being informed about their children’s safety, where they are located, when they will be reunited?People nationwide have have been watching the pain this forced family separation has caused so many innocent children and have begged President Trump to pick up the phone, sign a piece of paper—do whatever it takes to make it stop.I’m heading to the Senate floor to lift up the voices of millions of people across the country and in my home state of Washington who have been outraged and frustrated by what President Trump has been doing on our southern border. -PMDon’t think anybody is going to be your voice. Think “What am I going to do to be my own voice?”

So proud to stand with the families, teachers, caregivers, and advocates who are making their voices heard on the need for #ChildCare4All. #movement4childcare https://t.co/iRIy6fAS6E"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…”

On this World Refugee Day, let’s all pause to reflect on these words from the Statue of Liberty that have welcomed so many to our shores—&amp; strive to live up to our nation's promise of freedom.We can only build the #movement4childcare when people tell their Representatives, ‘I’m not quitting, I’m going to be at your office every, and I’m going to bring all my friends and their kids.” It takes a lot of time and energy, but together we can achieve #ChildCare4All https://t.co/6962PnmbhhPeople across the globe who have held up America as a beacon of freedom are now seeing our government rip apart families seeking safety &amp; asylum, &amp; detaining kids in cages.

President Trump &amp; his Administration should end this cruel practice immediately.NOW: I'm joining @DorrianWarren &amp; grassroots activists from around the country to fight for #ChildCare4All. Join the #movement4childcare and watch our conversation here: https://t.co/7ajM8yQrqpToday I'm joining @CCCAction, @CAPEarlyEd, @MomsRising, and hundreds of grassroots advocates to fight for the #movement4childcare. Tune in here at 10:30AM → https://t.co/7ajM8yQrqpPeople across the country are going to keep paying attention to this—they are going to continue demanding action—and they are going to hold President Trump and this Administration accountable. https://t.co/rUWuVGKuM5Right now, parents across the country are looking at their own children, and their own grandchildren and putting themselves in the shoes of our fellow humans and asking: Is this who we truly are as a nation? Are these our American values?Thanks for all your work, @morethanmySLE! Every person should have access to the care they need, and I’m going to keep fighting right along with you. https://t.co/DTlYFkR0R1The moral hole that President Trump has been digging since the moment he declared his candidacy has reached a new low—and we cannot allow what has been become expected to become acceptable.
 
What we are seeing being done right now, in our great country’s name, is truly horrific. https://t.co/PrfIvHGok3.@realDonaldTrump: You can end this right now—on your own—and you shouldn’t point fingers or wait any longer to act. https://t.co/GFmkDOxVc5I’ve heard from over 5,000 people in my home state of Washington calling on President Trump and his Administration to end this heartless, callous practice of separating children from their families at our southern border.People across the country are seeing what’s happening in their country’s name—a deliberate choice being made by President Trump and his Administration to separate children from their families. And they’re calling for it to stop now. https://t.co/kB3u6tQCoMWomen &amp; families fleeing domestic &amp; sexual abuse, kids being forced by violence to join gangs—these are some of the people seeking safety &amp; asylum at our borders. 

Turning them away is not only cruel, but undermines our shared values &amp; the promise of the American dream.The 340B drug discount program helps safety net health centers serve our most vulnerable communities—those with the greatest needs and fewest resources. We should build on the successes of this program, not slash benefits and stall accountability.About to discuss President Trump’s repeated attempts to sabotage the 340B drug discount program that helps so many of our struggling communities: https://t.co/YwXQctUc8XThis @wenatcheeworld op-ed gets it right: the Trump Administration’s cruel treatment of migrants seeking security in the US &amp; its reckless policy to separate kids from their parents undermine our nation’s legacy &amp; values. https://t.co/efPKBQsGvFPresident Trump could choose to have empathy &amp; show compassion to families fleeing traumatic crime &amp; violence. He could choose to keep families together instead of ripping them apart. 

The reality is he simply chooses not to.No matter your party, it should go w/o saying that detaining innocent kids &amp; separating them from their families is beyond cruel. 

Now more than ever, we must make our voices heard to end this despicable treatment of families seeking to come to our country.It’s not just apple &amp; wheat growers—w each passing day, it seems that families &amp; industries across WA are paying the severe price of President Trump’s misguided moves on trade. https://t.co/TWT4druaoFPowerful words President Trump needs to hear: “Children need their parents, &amp; children in families seeking refuge are especially vulnerable…(l)et us be a nation that values families &amp; offers a promise that all people seeking safety will find it here” https://t.co/RS9czlwk4EA sad but timely perspective on what’s at stake: “This is now who we are, until we prove we’re better: A country that strategically terrorizes kids and parents while all the regular comings and goings of American life…proceed in normalcy” https://t.co/ns9TgWXLXy.@TeamGleason has garnered respect across the nation throughout his years of exemplary athleticism &amp; passionate advocacy for ALS survivors &amp; families—thrilled to move one step closer to honoring his legacy w the Congressional Gold Medal https://t.co/OqAsQ7by4XProud to support these efforts that help break down barriers for tribal nations while empowering economic development in our local communities. https://t.co/Fh18zNqKltFrom one Coug to another, excited that our legislation to award @TeamGleason the Congressional Gold Medal—Congress’ highest honor—passed the Senate unanimously this week. 
https://t.co/OqAsQ7by4X“It’s hard to fathom that Trump’s vision of a great America would include traumatizing children &amp; housing their parents in facilities built for murderers &amp; gangsters. It’s certainly not a vision shared by most Americans.” https://t.co/518ED0JEWpThe Trump Administration’s efforts to deter families from seeking freedom in our country seem to grow crueler w each passing day. 
 
Republican leaders must come back to the table to work w Democrats &amp; finally repair our broken immigration system. Too many futures are at stake.No one in the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights was consulted before @BetsyDeVosED's rolled back guidance to enforce transgender students’ civil rights. This is shameful and wrong. https://t.co/lYTcYGjAmA.@BetsyDeVosED's own employees told her that the discrimination transgender students face in schools can be a matter of life and death. Instead, she backed away from enforcing their civil rights. https://t.co/lYTcYGBbe8@realDonaldTrump While we can and should recognize there is a problem with the overcapacity and oversupply of steel and aluminum, President Trump’s reckless, scattershot approach is threatening relationships with our allies, including our neighbor Canada, and jeopardizing American exports.@realDonaldTrump WA is the most trade dependent state in the nation, and President Trump’s tariffs pose a unique and potentially devastating threat to our growers and economy, as well as the millions of families who could see the costs of everyday goods go up.As @realDonaldTrump escalates his trade war today, I'm urging him: take steps to strengthen the relationships we have with our allies in order to go after bad actors and address unfair trade.

https://t.co/j0MufFzH7zWhat a thrill to meet the students &amp; educators representing WA at this year’s #NationalHistoryDay—your passion for history &amp; commitment to excellence is inspiring. Thank you for sharing highlights of WA’s rich culture &amp; heritage w the rest of our nation! https://t.co/S2QxnUEPrMIf @BetsyDeVosED really wanted to help student loan borrowers, she would stop listening to the for-profit college executives she hired at the Department, and start listening to the millions of students who are desperately looking for relief. https://t.co/4VAAAbxbuc.@BetsyDeVosED keeps claiming she wants to help students cheated and defrauded by predatory colleges, but at every turn she has put corporate profits ahead of students’ and borrowers’ best interests. https://t.co/4VAAAbfACEThanks to WA’s leadership, glad that our state’s students, families &amp; businesses will still have access to a free &amp; open internet—but we must continue to raise our voices until @FCC restores #NetNeutrality protections for consumers across the nation. https://t.co/P9RaiMDu8IFantastic news for Grays Harbor and all of WA—taking care of our ports &amp; waterways is critical to our state’s economy &amp; maintaining our heritage. Glad to support these investments in our home ports. https://t.co/BtLu6yTPITDemocrats are still at the table. We’ll be here all August ready to fix this for families in Washington state and across the country. I hope Republicans will return to the table and join us on finding solutions to lower patients’ costs and strengthen health care in our country.While President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have never fought for patients—as their latest decision makes abundantly clear—Democrats have never stopped fighting for them. And we’re not going to stop now.Trumpcare failed because people across the country made it clear they didn’t support President Trump’s sabotage agenda. President Trump didn’t listen. Instead he’s continued to undermine health care for our families at every opportunity, and Congressional Republicans have helped.This decision is unacceptable—it will abandon laws that prevent insurers from denying people with pre-existing conditions coverage, charging people more because of their gender, and raising premiums without limit for seniors and effectively pricing them out of the market.Last week, the Trump Administration showed once again there’s no limit to how low and how baseless they’ll go to appeal to extreme Republican donors and special interests. DOJ announced that it will ignore years of precedent and abandon its duty to defend our laws in court.Good reminder of the frightening risks of President Trump’s anti-middle class agenda: “…add all of this to sharp tax cuts &amp; spending increases…plus President Trump’s ill-conceived tariffs upon imports, &amp; conditions are ripe for another financial crisis” https://t.co/4Z1jNbKGxKI’m headed to the Senate floor to discuss the Trump-Pence Administration’s most recent act of health care sabotage: abandoning protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. -PMFinding and affording full-day #SummerCare puts added stress on working families. We need #ChildCare4All because every family deserves high-quality care that doesn’t break the bank.Finding and affording full-day #SummerCare puts added stress on working families. We need #ChildCare4All because every family deserves high-quality care that doesn’t break the bank. https://t.co/Y69K9mPR7tOur national parks, from the stunning North Cascades to Mt.

Proud to support legislation to care for these iconic parks &amp; preserve them for future generations. https://t.co/DE3nguV0RzFor Cheyenne and every other person in our country with a pre-existing condition, I promise to keep fighting to make sure you have access to the health care you need to grow up healthy and strong. https://t.co/kYoD0XCyxvWhen Cheyenne was born, she was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, excess fluid in her brain, and Down syndrome. All pre-existing conditions that wouldn’t be covered if President Trump and some Republicans got their way. https://t.co/MsnqNjw1JeThe pain of separating a parent from their child can be traumatizing and is no way to treat individuals coming to America seeking freedom from violence. The Trump Administration must end this cruel practice now. https://t.co/iVOcdeBuBZThe Trump Administration’s decision to turn away people fleeing domestic &amp; gang violence is disturbing, disheartening, and flat out wrong. 
 
Real lives are at stake—we cannot allow this reckless decision to stand. https://t.co/87u82FHZs0Homelessness &amp; housing insecurity impact too many in WA &amp; nationwide—hard to see any upside to stripping away vital investments from programs that provide critical housing support to WA families, &amp; glad to see @HUDgov reverse course on this misguided move. https://t.co/oAkbnAYmV5Proud to see WA students embrace equality &amp; lead → “Transgender people are not trying to cause a scene…nor are they trying to make people uncomfortable. The only goal they have is to go to the restroom without being noticed or judged — like anyone else.” https://t.co/e4aMnsKDiOWorth a read—this @Wenatcheeworld editorial does a great job of summing up the direct, negative consequences of President Trump’s reckless moves on trade for WA growers, businesses, &amp; consumers. https://t.co/cUONw5ZE6dRipping children away from their parents who come to the US fleeing violence goes against everything we stand for—we deserve answers from the Trump Administration about the disgraceful treatment of migrant families on US soil, &amp; I won’t stop holding them accountable. https://t.co/AnovhnvJDPAbout to join @SenWarren, @RepCummings, and @UniteThePoor for this important discussion on ways we can work together to help struggling communities across the country. https://t.co/hqBiYpN1vyWe must do more to understand the impact of workplace harassment—including the economic impact. That means we need more data on issues like how repeated harassment can prompt employees to change careers and drop out of the workforce. https://t.co/EHrABMQbyuWith stories from Sante Fe, Texas &amp; Parkland, Florida—to Marysville, in my home state—we should all know by now that there is no school, no family, no community that is exempt from the tragedy of gun violence.The impact of President Trump’s tariffs on WA, explained: “What’s not so complicated is the question of whether or not the tariffs will impact our agricultural industry, the economic engine of the region. The answer: Absolutely. This is going to hurt.” https://t.co/cUONw5I2HDPresident Trump listing proposals from his partisan budget as accomplishments to reduce drug costs is like saying dinner is served dinner when you’ve only written a grocery list. And in this case, most of the ingredients are for a big nothing-burger.In fact, despite his claim that he was ‘very much eliminating the middlemen,’ his plan includes proposals which would have the opposite effect—empowering the companies he calls middlemen, without any data to suggest it will bring down prices for patients.While campaigning, President Trump constantly brought up the idea of negotiating lower prices through Medicare—but it’s nowhere to be found in his proposal. As with so many other issues, President Trump talked a big game, and then, instead of backing it up, he backed away.President Trump hyped his drug pricing plan as a big step forward—it’s very clearly not. In fact, when he announced his plan to bring drug companies’ prices down, their stocks actually went up.Too many families are struggling to make ends meet because of skyrocketing drug prices. 1 in 4 people report that someone in their family didn’t get a prescription filled because cost. 1 in 4 cancer patients avoided filling a prescription for the same reason.As a candidate, President Trump talked a big game on lowering drug prices, but after 500 days in office the only health care “Price” he has dropped is his former Secretary.About to discuss the Trump Administration’s blueprint to reduce prescription drug prices, which offers far more questions than answers (135 questions, to be exact). https://t.co/rw4IL9gvdpWorkplace harassment hurts everyone—the true cost of sexual harassment includes decreased productivity, increased turnover, and reputational harm. It’s time we understood the scope of this problem better so we can do more to address it. https://t.co/EHrABMyAGW"It’s the dawn of a new era in America, one without any net neutrality protections—unless you happen to live in Washington state.” #NetNeutralty https://t.co/pwVFaVwOyvRT if you agree that we can’t let our federal government forget its moral &amp; legal responsibility to Hanford cleanup &amp; the sacrifices made by families &amp; communities throughout central WA. https://t.co/tKIXIqq2RWWe know that no employee should feel unsafe or harassed in the workplace, but we don’t know the economic costs of workplace harassment—it’s long past time that changed. https://t.co/EHrABMyAGWAttorney General Sessions’ decision is cruel, deeply wrong, and yet another example of the Trump Administration’s blatant and frightening disregard for women’s lives.Each year, tens of thousands of women look to the United States for safety from unimaginable, often life-threatening abuse, and for the opportunity to rebuild their lives.Despite what President Trump &amp; AG  Sessions may want to claim, domestic violence is not just a ‘private’ concern—and the United States should be a leader among nations in rooting it out here at home and protecting those who flee their homes to escape this scourge abroad. https://t.co/Kk2kWd1RdYThis is a disappointing day for internet freedom &amp; consumers, but our fight is not over—we must continue to raise our voices for #NetNeutrality &amp; press @FCC to reverse this misguided move for families, students, &amp; entrepreneurs. https://t.co/1sYU5LqXsT.@RepJayapal is right—this treatment of those seeking a better life on US soil is disturbing &amp; cruel. 
 
We cannot allow this to continue. President Trump &amp; Republican leaders must keep their word &amp; work w/ Democrats to fix our broken immigration system. https://t.co/I0jlusFshSWhat a powerful story—wishing the best of luck to Cheyenne &amp; her peers as you embark upon life’s next journey, &amp; hoping the lessons we learned from your tragedy will continue to inform our work to protect the next generation of students from gun violence. https://t.co/cedEZ6Fqw0Maintaining a healthy Mill Creek is critically important to Eastern WA’s long-term vitality &amp; safety.

We can’t expect the Trump Administration to get serious about solving the issue of gun violence in our schools if they can’t even name the problem. https://t.co/1gPp2XaFYJGood summation of the dangers of President Trump’s recent moves to raise tariffs on our allies: “…the prospect of a trade war is damaging to the economy in Washington and the rest of the country. And it belies the lessons of the past.” https://t.co/CqUIGflvnHAfter months of Republicans trying to enact Trumpcare by sabotage, it’s clear that families in WA &amp; nationwide are unfortunately paying the price for Republicans’ reckless, partisan approach to fixing health care. https://t.co/ORWhTcEU1bIn 2018, women are seeing attacks on their health and rights, they’re standing up and speaking out and saying, “who is saying what I would say?” https://t.co/cVq10BFhlSFrom stripping away protections for DREAMers to the disgraceful treatment of migrant children on our soil, it is evident that our immigration system is broken. 

Democrats remain ready to work toward solutions, but we need action from Republican leaders to get it done.President Trump promised to negotiate better trade deals for American workers, but so far the impact of his misguided actions will likely only hurt WA growers &amp; raise costs for consumers: https://t.co/ukf9lHWf0sWhat a thrilling ride, indeed—yesterday’s game may not have ended how we wanted, but it doesn’t diminish @UWSoftball's inspiring drive &amp; amazing accomplishments this season. WA is so proud of you! #MightyAreTheWomen https://t.co/OrLttTH5FePresident Trump promised not to cut Medicare, but recent reports show that his tax plan could weaken it and hurt patients nationwide. Republicans’ relentless health care sabotage has got to stop. https://t.co/2Axw6eD7ItCountless women in WA &amp; across the nation depend on health providers like Planned Parenthood for basic care. It’s impossible to overstate the detrimental impact President Trump’s ideological assault on women’s reproductive health will have on families &amp; public health.Sending positive energy to @UWSoftball ahead of tonight’s game—you’ve got a state full of proud Washingtonians cheering you on! #MightyAreTheWomenThis is disgraceful. I share @SenJeffMerkley’s outrage at the treatment of these children on US soil, and we must continue fighting back against President Trump’s repeated attempts to take our country backward. https://t.co/knbtsr7ULuNow, President Trump is finalizing policies to allow insurers to sell junk plans, which would spike health care costs for sick patients &amp; gut protections intended to ensure coverage meets the needs of women, seniors, and people who need mental health &amp; substance abuse treatment. https://t.co/UrEGkLqgqFMake no mistake: even though President Trump wasn’t able to jam his awful Trumpcare bill through Congress, he is implementing it step-by-step from the Oval Office—and it is driving up health costs for people nationwide.Proud to see WA continue to stand with our LGBTQ family, friends, &amp; neighbors in affirming that there’s no tolerance for discrimination in our state: https://t.co/JaOuppHqmSThis is another example of an empty promise made by @BetsyDeVosED and this Administration to address the senseless gun violence devastating families, schools, and communities around the country. https://t.co/1KaOVG5UDJYesterday people across Washington state saw in stark terms that they are now paying the price for Republicans’ partisan, political approach to health care in our country. https://t.co/g0lvLvwZYUToday, I urged @BetsyDeVosED to commit to testify in front of the HELP Committee on what meaningful gun safety reform we can enact to help end this scourge of violence in our schools. https://t.co/dBgimc97lKWith this budget, once again, @BetsyDeVosED is ignoring what millions of parents, teachers, and students are asking for — and has instead proposed more than $4 billion in cuts to elementary and secondary education. https://t.co/MTlyumhDVO@BetsyDeVosED .@BetsyDeVosED has taken concerning steps to undermine students’ rights by attempting to scale back the Office for Civil Rights; she’s rescinded guidance protecting transgender students, has made it easier for schools to again sweep sexual assault under the rug, and so much more.@BetsyDeVosED .@BetsyDeVosED has made it easier for predatory for-profit colleges and student loan companies to take advantage of students by rolling back a number of consumer protections, and has effectively dismantled the unit that investigates claims of fraud and abuse.@BetsyDeVosED .@BetsyDeVosED continues to prioritize her extreme privatization agenda—which would siphon taxpayer dollars away from public schools.No matter how we judge @BetsyDeVosED’s actions over the past year—either on the basis of proficiency or growth—the result is a failing grade.This couldn’t be clearer when looking at her actions over the past year --and today, I’m prepared to ask her questions on the budget she is in the Senate to defend:
https://t.co/WZ3cUmKDXK https://t.co/uaq901u4mjInstead of listening to the concerns of parents, teachers, &amp; students who have made their voices heard, @BetsyDeVosED has doubled down on a harmful agenda &amp; filled the @usedgov with for-profit college executives &amp; lobbyists looking out for their former employers and clients.Must-read op-ed on the threat of losing the Arctic Refuge, one of our last great wild places, to oil &amp; gas drilling: “We should not be a nation that trades away our children’s future for reckless, shortsighted political gimmicks.

It’s time for us to stand up and join together and fight back because I believe if we come together we can finally begin to address this critical issue in our country. #WearOrangeWeekend https://t.co/20ydqXubp4I’m wearing orange because across the country we have seen gun violence in every community, from Sante Fe, Texas, to Parkland, Florida, to Washington state, in way too many communities. It’s time for us to stand up and join together and fight back. #WearOrange https://t.co/F1myQOkHIVI had the opportunity to hear more about how the opioid crisis is affecting Kitsap County. These stories put a much-needed human face on the epidemic, and remind us how important it is to stop punishing addiction and start providing necessary care. https://t.co/XpPG8cAxZpThe longer we wait to take action, the longer sexual assault and workplace harassment can still be swept under the rug. Doing everything we can to find out the impacts on workers and our economy would be a good step forward. https://t.co/8CAA7uE9fqProud to join @SenGillibrand, @SenWarren, &amp; @SenFeinstein to call on Gov Accountability Office to investigate the economic impacts that sexual harassment in the workplace can have on our economy.

I heard more about the challenges they face firsthand from members of the Puyallup community yesterday. https://t.co/YVlqNWSyGpIt’s going to take all of us working to combat the opioid epidemic. Thanks to those at Peninsula Community Health Services for the work you’re doing to help families across Washington state. https://t.co/20edoXDPerHaving access to high-quality child care can make all the difference for young parents trying to finish their degree. It’s inspiring to see the good work happening at Oakland HS to ensure all students succeed. https://t.co/fGN1SiHuRiThe Trump-Pence Administration’s most recent attack on women’s health will only energize Democrats across the country. Those who believe in a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions about her own body will keep making their voices heard.I am proud of Washington state for leading the way in sexual health education. Lesson plans from King County’s highly-successful Family Life and Sexual Health (FLASH) program were downloaded 80,000 times last year by educators across the country.I’m glad that despite the Trump-Pence Administration’s attempts to undermine investments in the health of women and youths, King County can continue providing young people the information they need to make healthy decisions and plan for their futures: https://t.co/hqdooL9mJXIt was an honor to tour PLU's Nursing School in Tacoma today to meet the next generation of nurses, incl many who will go on to work in underserved regions. Thank you to all nurses for what you do to make our country stronger, safer, and healthier. https://t.co/30ZCPaTFY8.@EverettHerald is correct—President Trump’s attempt to roll back family planning funding will only lead to more unplanned pregnancies, disproportionately affect low-income women, and overburden our community health centers: https://t.co/e5c3Nv01PNEnding veteran homelessness in the US won’t be easy, but we can never ever ease up on our duty to care for those who served. I’m so proud to see WA’s Kittitas County leading the way on this effort. https://t.co/TnKah5pnSUAs the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know the sacrifice that servicemembers &amp; their families make to protect our nation and defend our freedom. But there is no sacrifice greater than the sacrifice made by servicemembers who gave their lives for this country. #MemorialDayOn this Memorial Day, I hope every American has an opportunity to honor the brave men and women who paid the ultimate price for our freedoms and that as a country, we take this opportunity to renew our commitment to all of those who have served or are currently serving. https://t.co/7m1mojfGnCAnother report shows that in Washington state Republicans’ junk plans and repeal efforts are estimated to cause premiums to increase over a thousand dollars. Higher premiums and more uninsured are the trend across the country—but they didn’t have to be.
https://t.co/ctiaZdrwyA#TitleX family planning funds are critical for women across the country, and according to recent studies, in 2015, these funds supported contraceptive services that helped WA women to prevent 17,700 unintended pregnancies and 6,000 abortions. https://t.co/eYc4bybilOThe new warnings about the impact of Republicans’ health care sabotage efforts are becoming alarmingly familiar. Rising health care costs and millions more uninsured. https://t.co/J25RHycycpIn Washington state in 2015, there were 64 family planning clinics that received #TitleX funding, providing care for 82,520 women. President Trump’s move to roll back these family planning funds is an attack on women’s health and freedoms. https://t.co/mogr01cUnSRepublican’s don’t have to continue down this destructive path, and I hope they won’t choose to—Democrats are still at the table and ready to work together on serious solutions to try to lower costs, expand access, and help more families get the care they need.Unfortunately Republican leaders are more focused on appealing to their far-right base than solving problems. They ended talks by demanding language to undermine women’s health care they knew was a nonstarter, some are even back to extreme repeal efforts. https://t.co/Awumqb2iYHPresident Trump didn’t have to undermine health care by expanding junk insurance, Republicans didn’t have to sabotage it with a partisan tax bill, and they certainly didn’t have to torpedo bipartisan efforts to make things better.We’ve now shown that we can work together to make progress on this issue, and there is every reason to keep pushing for more—here in Congress and in workplaces across the country. That’s exactly what we plan to do. https://t.co/laoiudFwiFThis step forward was only possible because women chose to come forward with painful stories of assault and harassment in order to prevent other women from experiencing the same. I am inspired by their courage. https://t.co/x4ABWBKQnHThankful for the great work done by @SenAmyKlobuchar, @SenGillibrand, @RoyBlunt &amp; others to negotiate this bipartisan bill, which will help increase transparency, extend protections, &amp; give survivors of workplace harassment in Congress more tools to hold perpetrators accountable.This is a long-overdue and much-needed step toward overhauling the way harassment is addressed in the United States Congress. It’s an important step, but it cannot be the last. https://t.co/nd5jAKD1m2While the Trump-Pence Administration continues to roll back women’s access to health care, a quick reminder of just how many people will be impacted in Washington state. https://t.co/9BYCQQqmD0@PPFA @Guttmacher @SenTinaSmith At the end of the day, a woman’s ability to make the health care choices that are right for her is fundamental to her economic security, her independence, and her ability to shape her own future.@PPFA @Guttmacher @SenTinaSmith In my home state of Washington, health care providers funded by #TitleX delivered contraceptive care to more than 80,000 patients in one year alone.@PPFA @Guttmacher @SenTinaSmith Last week, President Trump and Vice President Pence launched one of their most blatant, extreme, and harmful attacks yet on women’s reproductive health. #TitleXGetting ready to join @PPFA,  @Guttmacher, and @SenTinaSmith to talk about President Trump’s and VP Pence’s harmful attacks on women’s reproductive health. #TitleXWe should all know by now that no family, no school, no community is exempt from the tragedy of gun violence.

We can’t stand by doing nothing &amp; expect the status quo to change. It’s beyond time to pass common-sense gun reforms.Too many women &amp; families in WA &amp; nationwide count on the care they receive at @PPFA to lead healthy, independent lives for us to allow the Trump Administration’s latest attacks on women’s health to stand—we must stand up &amp; fight back. https://t.co/G0WYg0VXnQFrom our economy, to our environment, to our culture &amp; heritage, the Columbia River Treaty is integral to so much of the PNW way of life—glad to see stakeholders come together in good faith to update this important pact for WA. https://t.co/M6CvLBz5UkThese “hidden heroes” often make significant personal sacrifices to make sure the men &amp; women who sacrificed for our country are taken care of—&amp; as a nation, it’s our job to have their backs.

The stakes are too high for our families to allow Republicans in Congress to pretend we don't need action.Without strong investments in education, our students—and our future workforce—will pay the price. https://t.co/JAAcJRaiONAs this bill to shore up our preparedness for public health emergencies moves forward, I hope we can continue our bipartisan work to address other priorities for families across the country—like our high maternal mortality rate. https://t.co/8MsUC5m4mTThe recent resurgence of Ebola in the Congo is a stark reminder that the threats we are working to address aren’t hypothetical.

Glad to talk to @BelReporter about how my #ChildCare4All bill will help make care more affordable, improve access to early learning, &amp; improve worker pay &amp; training https://t.co/ErUwVWErHDOur health care workforce training programs have a positive impact—but we need to invest in that impact on a larger scale. Compared to the scope of the problem, we are fighting fires with a squirt gun.We need to make sure we have a strong pipeline to recruit, train, and retain more health professionals, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and we need to make sure that pipeline includes professionals who have different backgrounds and specialties.Building a robust, diverse, collaborative workforce isn’t just one big challenge, it is many smaller, interconnected challenges too. https://t.co/SmH7V3AG2eAs @BetsyDeVosED continues to roll back civil rights protections for students, Democrats in Congress are going to keep shining a spotlight on her harmful actions. https://t.co/b9QpJtwDtHTiffany, like so many military spouses, didn’t think twice about whether she would care for her husband and their growing family when he was injured. It was just a matter of how she would do it—that’s why the Caregivers program is so important. https://t.co/66PAiAW22OThe Caregiver program is a game-changer for the approx 5.5 million people people who have put their lives on hold to care for a loved one who returned from service with illness or injury, and I’m urging my colleagues to support this critically important program. https://t.co/VZAMSPMSk1I’m heading to the Senate floor to bring attention to a particular provision of the bill now before the Senate—a provision that would do so much to help our country fulfill its promise to veterans, by expanding and strengthening the @DeptVetAffairs Caregiver program. -PMAnd by increasing investments in low-income schools and communities, we can make sure that this American tradition continues, and take another important step toward closing the achievement gap and helping elevate the students that need our help the most. https://t.co/VKo0hNhvRgWe must continuously strive for equity, and ensure all students have the tools and support they need to achieve their dreams, no matter where they live, how they learn, or how much money their parents make. #ABetterDeal https://t.co/37Qik2aNBeWithout strong investments in education our students, and our future workforce, will pay the price.

Either stand with everyday people—or with the massive corporations that have found a new way to make more money off of them.These ideological moves by President Trump to restrict how #TitleX family planning funds work would be a new low in his continued efforts to undermine women’s health.

But I’m not giving up on looking for bipartisan solutions, and I am urging Republicans to join me. https://t.co/USJP5f6752I want any Republican who is interested in solutions on health care, not partisanship, and who is focused on helping patients, not special interests, to know that I’m still ready to get back to work. https://t.co/USJP5f6752President Trump can talk and tweet about drug prices all he wants, but given his actions like those against the 340B drug discount program, he’s not going to have a lot of credibility and his promises aren’t going to come true.Many hospitals and health providers in WA are using 340B savings to stretch their resources to reach more patients in vulnerable communities—we need to make sure we keep this program working for the many struggling families that it helps serve.About to discuss the importance of maintaining and strengthening a drug discount program that helps providers across WA state serve vulnerable communities. https://t.co/PG1bnkWUw9The Internet has become an indispensable resource for people across WA &amp; our nation—&amp; keeping it free and open is important to so many of our communities &amp; economies.

Proud to stand w @SenateDems as we vote this Wednesday to reverse @FCC’s decision &amp; restore #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/G4PI5db1C7Will be thinking of WA’s small business owners &amp; middle class families who benefit from a free &amp; open Internet when we vote this week to overturn @FCC’s misguided move on #NetNeutrality—hoping our Republican colleagues choose to stand w us, too.Sending thoughts and courage to my friend, Harry Reid. He is a fighter, he always has been, and I’m standing with him and his family. -PMBoth sides of the aisle agree—providing clear nutrition information w our food empowers families to make the best decisions to support their health. Glad to see @FDA finally implement this bipartisan solution. https://t.co/EI0viIIVsSIf former Secretary Price truly wants everyone to have coverage he should tell President Trump and Republicans to stop driving up premiums and sabotaging families’ care—and this time he shouldn’t try to walk it back. https://t.co/76sfT0B4DJOur fight to keep the internet free &amp; open isn’t over—this week, @SenateDems will force a vote to overturn President Trump &amp; @FCC’s attempt to change the Internet as we know it.

If you believe in #NetNeutrality, it’s not too late make your voices heard.  https://t.co/kYcjRpG3oqAs @EPAScottPruitt continues working to undermine @EPA’s efforts to keep our air clean &amp; promote public health, proud to see WA &amp; others stepping up to defend our environment &amp; communities. https://t.co/tDH0HsLt3hNext week, I’ll be joining @SenateDems to force a vote on legislation that would overturn President Trump’s FCC’s move to scrap #NetNeutrality and help ensure a free and open internet for everyone. https://t.co/oyIuf8OoRZWe’ll be voting next week. We just need one more vote to get this done. #NetNeutrality https://t.co/2MD5q4ZN8mThis is great news for consumers—glad to see @FDA finally act to provide clear nutrition information to customers &amp; support public health in our families &amp; communities. https://t.co/o5mm9lZ0s0The latest radical changes Republicans are pushing to #TitleX family planning funding would be harmful to millions who rely on Title X providers to get birth control, lifesaving cancer screenings, HIV screening tests, and more.During National #NursesWeek we recognize the hard work and endless dedication of nurses across the country who help people get healthy and stay healthy. Thanks for everything you do for our families!Congratulations to @RepBarbaraLee! Looking forward to continuing to fight alongside you to protect the health and rights of all women. https://t.co/6Oa3pm0NIe@SecAzar @HHSGov Families want us to solve important issues like the opioid crisis, the high maternal  mortality rate, and the epidemic of gun violence—not sabotage health care and raise families’ premiums.@SecAzar @HHSGov Any attempt by the Administration to break its promises and undo the bipartisan funding deal the President signed into law would be a major breach of faith, and we will strongly oppose it.@SecAzar @HHSGov A budget isn’t just a set of numbers, it’s a statement of values and priorities—and President Trump’s budget proposal for @HHSgov shows this Administration does not value evidence, science, and good policymaking practices.Heading to an appropriations hearing to ask @SecAzar about my concerns with President Trump’s backwards budget proposal for @HHSgov and the many red flags it raises about how they plan to keep our communities healthy.At a hospital in Washington state I heard about how many babies there were delivered to mothers fighting opioid addiction. This article shows how important it is we address this national issue from all angles. https://t.co/Prga9h1kh7Preserving #NetNeutrality is a no-brainer when it comes to protecting consumers and their access to a free and open internet. We just need one more vote to get this done in the Senate.The opioid crisis doesn’t just impact individual people—it impacts entire families. That’s why my bipartisan legislation includes proposals to address the ripple effects of addiction. https://t.co/Prga9h1kh7The internet doesn’t belong to @AjitPaiFCC and @realDonaldTrump, it belongs to people. Keep making your voices heard to save #NetNeutrality. We just need #OneMoreVote. https://t.co/fiGsDXi0uWToday, I’m joining @SenateDems in officially filing the petition that allows us to force a vote on the Senate floor to save #NetNeutrality.

With just #OneMoreVote from a Republican, we can get this done. https://t.co/NiV5EDxV60Republicans in Congress haven’t  just sat by and watched—they helped sabotage families’ health care, by passing a tax bill that President Trump’s own former Secretary of Health admitted would cause premiums to go up.Today, I had the honor of meeting Tina who travelled all the way from Issaquah, WA to fight for #SNAP—a critical program that is giving her the support she &amp; her son need while she gets her degree. Thanks for sharing your story, Tina, I’m going to keep fighting along with you! https://t.co/UFQ7sIQhQRHard to believe it’s been 10 years since we banded together to create the Wild Sky Wilderness &amp; preserve one of WA's environmental treasures. Thanks for the great trip down memory lane, @WA_Wild—proud of our work to protect our natural habitats for generations to come. https://t.co/wjGFN8Fy7SPresident Trump and Republicans’ health care sabotage has had a real impact. https://t.co/5l6zCwpJZfThank you @MandyRheaWrites for reminding President Trump how important his words are and what effect they have on our children. #TeacherAppreciationDay https://t.co/71MvBgDzEqCongratulations Suzi! https://t.co/jddhwwnI1LI oppose this latest reckless move by President Trump to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal, and I strongly encourage him to reconsider. -PMThis decision also erodes our ability to make new diplomatic agreements as we head into critical talks with North Korea, and it increases regional tension and moves us closer to armed conflict that should be avoided if at all possible.President Trump taking these steps to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal right now, without presenting any good evidence or rationale that Iran has violated it, moves us further from our goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.Once again, we must raise our voices &amp; defend our communities against these efforts to rip the social safety net away from families in need. As a voice for WA, I pledge to continue fighting back against these cruel, reckless proposals.WA needs more, not less, affordable housing—but the Trump Administration’s plan to slash funding for key housing programs would make it much harder to connect WA families in need w affordable housing options in their communities #CutsHurtAs communities in WA &amp; across the country address homelessness, the last thing our federal government should be doing is making it harder for families to find a safe, affordable place to call home #OurHomesOurVoicesPresident Trump and Republicans in Congress have intentionally made it harder for people to get health care coverage by making open enrollment windows shorter and slashing investments in telling people about their coverage options.Happy #NationalTeacherAppreciationDay to all of our amazing teachers out there who do such an amazing job day in and day out teaching our children and helping their communities. https://t.co/wn6pBJGEnDPresident Trump and Republicans in Congress have intentionally made it harder for people to get health care coverage by making open enrollment windows shorter and slashing investments in telling people about their coverage options.President Trump and Republicans in Congress have created confusion and uncertainty about the future of health care in our country and have said the best thing would be to let it “explode.”President Trump couldn’t force Trumpcare through Congress—so he decided to create it from the Oval Office by sabotaging families’ health care in every way he could. https://t.co/gwlwPjC0vTLIVE at 11:15: I’m joining my colleagues in calling on President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ actions to increase people and families’ health care costs. https://t.co/PcE5g7EnVdFamilies across the country want access to nutritional information to help them make healthy decisions about the food they buy and eat—and the new menu labeling rule that went into effect today will help make sure they get it. https://t.co/3KMgDEGsdbWhen it comes to curbing the tragedy of the #opioidcrisis in our homes &amp; communities, the best way to get patients &amp; families access to the help they need is to start treating addiction like the public health challenge it is. https://t.co/DtglGnnkj0Just like when hurricanes &amp; other natural disasters strike, our country can &amp; should step up to help when our communities are ravaged by devastating wildfires.

That’s why I’ve introduced legislation to ensure that no community has to shoulder the burden of recovery alone. https://t.co/oSie5jKEs3Pasco, Washington is helping lead the way to the future of health, as they help launch the groundbreaking @AllofUsResearch program which aims to involve one million people in an ambitious new research project. #joinallofus https://t.co/Kt0CxoNbBFToday the @AllofUsResearch program is launching an innovative effort to change the future of health.

Proud to join my Senate colleagues in the fight to protect #NetNeutrality https://t.co/nrJFyV2QRCThis fight isn’t over. We need just one more senator to reject corporate interests and instead stand with the families, workers, small business owners, and students they represent to get this passed in the Senate. #NetNeutrality https://t.co/2Pt4PBqJwbSo encouraged by my conversation today w some of the student organizers from @MFOLseattle — the work they’re doing locally to make our schools &amp; communities safe from gun violence is awe-inspiring. Proud to stand w these amazing young leaders. https://t.co/lOXY535hwQWe should be doing everything to ensure all women have access to STEM education &amp; careers—and the fact that these young girls experienced anything but congratulations, is heartbreaking.  

India, Mikayla, &amp; Bria: I’m so proud of you, and I’m excited to see what you do next. https://t.co/HEABUfZ2seNote to former Secretary Price: The truth isn’t like your taxpayer-funded travel—you can’t just charter your way to a new destination after accidentally admitting that Republicans are increasing people’s health care costs. https://t.co/NUuAU160keIt’s been so inspiring to see so many people getting involved in politics and making their voices heard over the past year, some for the first time. This is what will make a difference—and it needs to continue. #CivicCocktail https://t.co/ES4RQuwm4zLooking forward to joining @jbalter  tonight at @SeattleCityClub’s #CivicCocktail discussion! We’ll be talking access to child care, work to address the opioid crisis, and so much more. https://t.co/J9bEGWnPXbThe response to our letter to @USDOL &amp; @BLS_gov requesting data on sexual harassment in the workplace was wholly inadequate. I hope the Department will rethink its refusal to look into this issue. https://t.co/0om6tmWnBD“If you don’t have child care, you can’t get a job.” Watch these moms share their stories on what it’s like to be a working parent who struggles to find and afford child care. https://t.co/CDaPNyLJzsMake sure you tune in to @Q13FOX to catch @SimoneReport’s story from our chat in Seattle w parents in recovery about our new bipartisan plan to combat the #opioidcrisis https://t.co/Sk6nLr0SRyMany thanks to Alise &amp; Parents for Parents for hosting today’s discussion on the #opioidcrisis &amp; sharing your powerful stories of recovery—looking forward to seeing the story on @Q13FOX https://t.co/3ZaHvbWBSXThere’s a lot of work to do to address the pervasive, systemic, &amp; longstanding issue of sexual harassment in the workplace. We should be collecting more data to help us understand the impacts, &amp; I’m disappointed @BLS_gov won’t commit to this critical step. https://t.co/0om6tmEMd3Listening to Seattle parents in recovery recount the impact of their substance use on their children, it’s clear that we must do more to support patients &amp; families while we work to end the #opioidcrisis. https://t.co/gNbgGLIP7pI hope we can step back and look at what’s right for kids in the long term. And I hope @BetsyDeVosED will come to realize that means serious investments in public education and support for our teachers and schools.  https://t.co/WD3BGJLUtq.@BetsyDeVosED still doesn’t seem to get it—the Secretary of Education should listen to our teachers and parents and stand up for public education. https://t.co/WD3BGJujBSIf @BLS_gov really takes workplace sexual harassment “very seriously” it should commit to collecting data on this issue—instead they told us it would be “complex and costly.” Workers and women deserve better. https://t.co/0om6tmWnBDAs so many K-12 teachers are organizing and using their voices to fight for more investments in public education, early childhood educators and child care workers are still being left behind. Here's what we can do about it à https://t.co/KjNUvQNj4vIt has been clear that Republican sabotage will cause health care premiums to skyrocket, I’m glad former Secretary Price is finally willing to admit these efforts are going to make care less affordable for families. https://t.co/qC9CRfQnhDHad a great time today visiting the staff &amp; children at @WWU’s AS Child Development Center. It’s up to all of us to ensure our next generation of thinkers, workers &amp; leaders are prepared for the challenges of the future—and that starts with giving them a solid educational start. https://t.co/pByndotlvjNow that former Secretary Price has admitted Republican health care sabotage will drive up prices. Republicans should drop the partisanship and work with Democrats to repair as much of the damage they’ve done as possible. https://t.co/qC9CRg7Y9bCongratulations to the students at Bellevue’s Odle Middle School for your 1st place finish at the 2018 National Science Bowl!

Now many of the same lawmakers are working to cut vital investments to SNAP that help provide food to families in need https://t.co/VqShYWNLd1The federal government can &amp; should support solid state &amp; local efforts to stem the tide of this epidemic—that’s why we’re working to pass our bipartisan bill to tackle the #opioidcrisis into law. https://t.co/EkhapwaiIlAlmost half of 3- and 4-year-olds are not enrolled in high quality preschool programs.

I know that whatever you do next, you will continue to lead and inspire. https://t.co/noMP0mDHJiA federal judge paused President Trump’s reckless efforts to end the DACA program last week, but it’s no substitute for legislative action. It’s past time for Republican leaders in Congress to work w Democrats to write permanent protections for Dreamers into our laws.Every person should be able to go to work without putting their life or safety at risk. This Workers Memorial Day, we must honor those who lost their lives and commit to keep fighting for better health and safety standards across the country. #1uSafety https://t.co/7NcXFTrnqkThe opioid crisis costs Washington state $9 billion dollars a year, and the personal toll on many families simply can’t be measured.

Who did you bring to work today? https://t.co/4uYC2qoinZNow, it’s time for Republican leaders to bring this up for a vote so we can ensure Special Counsel Mueller is able to continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead in the Russia investigation. https://t.co/5vrKO63ZlcPresident Trump and Scott Pruitt may not care about our public health, our air, or our climate—but families in Washington state and across the country do and they deserve so much better.Reminder: @EPAScottPruitt is currently under at least SEVEN separate independent federal investigations.

He needs to be held accountable for his failures at @EPA and resign. https://t.co/ZeUlpzLQgNThis should be a lesson to Republican leaders and those trying to cut corners and jam nominees through the Senate—there is a reason that we want to take the time to scrutinize nominees and make sure they are ready and able to do the job.The position of VA Secretary has never been, nor should ever be, an afterthought. I hope President Trump takes the lessons of this failed nominee to heart &amp; recommends someone with the integrity, leadership, management experience, and dedication to serve our veterans.The lack of scrutiny that President Trump gave his most recent VA Secretary nominee is an insult to the millions of veterans who deserve a serious and strong leader who is ready on day one to bring this agency up to what is expected by all Americans. https://t.co/7vLSqKE149The tragedy of the opioid crisis has not only cost countless lives, but billions of dollars to WA—all the more reason for lawmakers to support our bipartisan bill to bring more resources to communities fighting to end the epidemic. https://t.co/IBDYOoi19eVery pleased that in Washington state, the Trump Administration will have one less opportunity to close the door on critical research that could help young people get information they need to be healthy and plan for their futures. https://t.co/F9mEQV4o0r“It's rare to see bipartisan work in Congress these days, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are coming together to try and tackle the opioid epidemic.” https://t.co/iTMnn0wswF
