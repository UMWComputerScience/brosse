Wake up. Do your job.

You swore an oath to the Constitution, not to this President. Your job is oversight, not to help Trump‚Äôs legal defense. 

These attacks on our justice system must end. https://t.co/0sWIri73hFWell, I guess if Russia continues to deny interference in our election, that resolves the matter. Make way Reagan, for the Trump Doctrine: Trust, but never verify.

Verification is for losers. https://t.co/R9Uvnzu25WMcConnell held a Supreme Court seat open for a year, insisting no Justice be confirmed in an election year without voters having a say. This was a terrible precedent but one he will need to live with. Dem Senators must insist ‚Äî absolutely no confirmation until after the midterm.Another effort by Paul Manafort to challenge the legality of the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation has failed. Could it be because the charges are well founded and Mueller is well within his jurisdiction? https://t.co/u99HIVEKjrDecision to uphold Muslim Ban is deeply disappointing and gives scant weight to @POTUS‚Äôs explicit statements about its impermissible intent. We must fight for our national values, which are threatened by Trump's actions and the historically conservative court now upholding them.Erdogan ‚Äúwon‚Äù reelection in Turkey this weekend only by decimating the opposition through arrests, violence and squashing freedom of the press.

Turkey's descent into autocracy is another reminder that democracy is under assault worldwide.

DO NOT CONGRATULATE.The horror of family separation may be ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs Katrina‚Äù and the images of stricken children the crucible that forges a lasting impression of this malevolent administration.

I'm urging the House Appropriations Committee to prevent funds from ever being used to separate families entering the US: https://t.co/JzZu58AUOfGiuliani just revealed that Trump‚Äôs supposed willingness to testify to Mueller is a charade.

Only a subpoena is likely to bring about a timely interview with the President whose lawyers fear is either incapable of telling the truth, or that the truth is far too incriminating. https://t.co/XQxQPADA5LSeparating children from their families is inhumane. 

Jailing families indefinitely is also not the answer. 

What we want is a smart immigration policy, characterized by 
human decency.

And a President who knows right from wrong. https://t.co/1H7RSHKvMaFirst, Trump created a crisis by repealing DACA, and threatened to deport DREAMErs if he didn‚Äôt get his wall.

Next, he created a crisis by separating children from their parents, and held them hostage.

This nightmare isn‚Äôt over. And it won‚Äôt be over until his presidency is.No, @SecNielsen did not do a ‚Äúfabulous job,‚Äù she just repeated the falsehoods you have told to justify the indefensible treatment of these families. She has lost her credibility, and a DHS Secretary that cannot be relied upon by the country has no value. She should step down. https://t.co/mAxAz1w26NSenate voted to reinstate sanctions on Chinese telecom firm ZTE ‚Äî now the House should do the same.

I know there‚Äôs great reluctance among former Presidents and First Ladies to comment on the current President. But this Administration‚Äôs family separation policy is so abhorrent &amp; antithetical to our values that all Americans must condemn it. https://t.co/f6xWxEqKMtStone‚Äôs testimony appears inaccurate or deliberately misleading.

And by accepting the President‚Äôs many falsehoods about what is required to end this policy, the GOP in Congress has become the party of lies. https://t.co/2XmSaFRoPmThe President says it's irrelevant whether he lied about dictating Don Jr.'s statement on the Trump Tower meeting, because he was just being dishonest with the public.

No wonder he is trying to dodge answering Special Counsel Mueller's questions, when he would be under oath. https://t.co/zJaO6n5PbuThe Administration's policy of separating parents from their kids is an unnecessary and deliberate cruelty. Have you seen the images of these devastated children? Heard the story of the devastated father who took his own life? This is not the America we know &amp; love. It must stop. https://t.co/K31A5vqfbvNo deep state. No secret society. No anti-Trump cabal at the FBI. No evidence that political bias influenced decisions in the Clinton probe.

Trump defended Kim by saying he was ‚Äúa tough guy.‚Äù

Trump can‚Äôt conceal his admiration for despots, or his disdain for democratic leaders like Justin Trudeau. And still, Republicans stay silent.The GOP failed to destroy the Affordable Care Act in Congress, so now Trump Admin will use the courts. Shockingly, they seek to gut protections for preexisting conditions, something they swore to defend.

North Korea is a real and present threat. So is a dangerously naive president. https://t.co/dufG8rVHsLOpen lines of communication are always preferable to the possibility of military conflict, particularly nuclear war. An objective assessment of the result of the summit with North Korea, however, reveals dangerous concessions by Trump, and no new commitment or specifics by Kim: https://t.co/GADmsHNqPX#NetNeutrality protections end today because House Republicans refused to act.

Then, we‚Äôre told Trump had no part in drafting the false Trump Tower statement. Then, we‚Äôre told he weighed in. Now, we‚Äôre told he dictated it. Not a word can be trusted of Trump or his staff on Russia, or perhaps anything. https://t.co/wEFoytdNG4The President‚Äôs legal arguments would render whole sections of the Constitution moot, and allow a president to engage in any form of criminality and obstruct an investigation into his own wrongdoing. Nobody is above the law. Not this President. Not any president. https://t.co/DKpZizrpKlPower to pardon or commute sentences can be used to right injustices, like Matthew Charles who served twenty years and is being sent back to prison over a technicality. Or ... it can be used for a fellow TV personality convicted of obstruction of justice. https://t.co/wp9j3wvrgMAbuse of power continues with pardon of conservative activist who broke campaign finance laws by hiding donations over the legal limit, not unlike concealment of Stormy Daniels payment. @POTUS says unfair.

@POTUS today: Back to his usual focus - himself. https://t.co/eBbvP7S8dCThe evidence that President Trump sought to interfere with the Russia investigation continues to mount. If Trump tried to have Sessions reinsert himself in the Russia probe so that his loyalist could improperly influence its findings, it is more proof of a corrupt intent. https://t.co/CWEeOKbHnMOn Memorial Day, we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice defending our country.

It's then promoted by the President, who echoes the falsehood. Then his allies call to investigate the falsehood.

This is how propaganda works. It is also how democracy dies, one lie at a time.Terrified children are being separated from their parents pursuant to your Administration‚Äôs policy, Mr. President. You have power to stop it.

Our statement: https://t.co/5yPuIaMDnlFalse statements about wiretaps at Trump Tower.

False statements about unmasking.

False statesments about a political spy in the Trump campaign.

False statements about the Mueller investigation that has indicted the President‚Äôs top staff.

It‚Äôs not spy-gate, only lie-gate.There‚Äôs a reason why this is the most scandal-plagued Administration in modern history. When you combine an unethical President with one-party rule, it is an invitation to ruin. Power corrupts, and Trump‚Äôs absolute power has corrupted all too absolutely.The White House has directed the DOJ and FBI to hold a partisan briefing on infomation the President wants given to his allies in Congress. No Democrats allowed.

This is another serious abuse of power. There‚Äôs a bipartisan mechanism called the Gang of 8. They need to use it.Alarming to see that the Secretary charged with protecting the 2018 elections claims not to have read the intelligence on the 2016 elections.

If she had, she would have seen the specific evidence the Russians sought to help Trump, a finding now affirmed on a bipartisan basis. https://t.co/HgsDG5ahxmThis statement raises two serious concerns:

First, if these are same materials DOJ warned could risk lives and investigations, why share them now? 

Second, is Kelly attending? The President must not abuse his power to obtain investigatory materials for his legal defense team. https://t.co/aedjJ3rDlzGiuliani removes all doubt ‚Äì the White House effort to force DOJ to give investigatory materials to Congress is really about the defense team getting their hands on them. If the President is charged with a crime, he has a right to see the evidence. Not before. https://t.co/HfzzdZ894dTrump‚Äôs claim of an embedded ‚Äúspy‚Äù is nonsense. His ‚Äúdemand‚Äù DOJ investigate something they know to be untrue is an abuse of power, and an effort to distract from his growing legal problems. Never mind that DOJ has warned that lives and alliances are at risk. He doesn‚Äôt care. https://t.co/c1itPmiHnvHorrified by the shooting in Santa Fe that took the lives of 9 students and a teacher.

Now, one year in, Republicans in the House are working desperately to discredit Mueller, DOJ, and FBI.

We must let him do his work. The rule of law depends on it.Just introduced a bill requiring any Executive Branch spending at Trump-owned businesses, like golf courses and hotels, be disclosed to the public. Americans deserve to see how their tax dollars are being used to enrich the nation‚Äôs chief executive and his family. https://t.co/UWhTB7yiQqMurderers, rapists, and animals.

Sunlight is always the best disinfectant.They sought to harness Americans‚Äô very real frustrations and anger over sensitive political matters to influence our thinking, voting and behavior. They created online communities that appeared organic and American, but were really run by a troll farm in St. Petersburg: https://t.co/8NabLfv6goRussia sought to divide us by our race, our country of origin, our religion, and our politics. They attempted to hijack legitimate events meant to do good ‚Äì teaching self-defense, providing legal aid ‚Äì as well as those events meant to widen a rift.
 
Here's just some examples: https://t.co/YMX2FTgPGURussia sought to weaponize social media to drive a wedge between Americans, and in an attempt to sway the 2016 election. They created fake accounts, pages and communities to push divisive online content and videos, and to mobilize real Americans. 
 
Here's how: https://t.co/JqKSm5saAiLast year, the bipartisan leadership of the House Intel Committee made a promise to the American people to publicly release the Facebook advertisements used by the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency.
 
Today, the Minority is fulfilling that promise: https://t.co/zsZXLIavp1VP Pence has now brought his sycophancy to a whole new level. With questions concerning which senior transition officials were aware of Flynn‚Äôs secret talks w/ Russian Ambassador still unanswered and new revelations every day, investigation must continue without his interference. https://t.co/gXFdZVc15hThe President‚Äôs assault on freedom of the press continues as he threatens the credentials of reporters who expose his malfeasance. America must be vigilant: A people loses its freedom not by sudden approach, but by steps so small it doesn‚Äôt see tyranny coming. https://t.co/LLSsX8dNhnVery pleased to hear of the release of three Americans from North Korea. The North Korean regime has long used hostage taking to gain leverage over the United States. I hope and pray these will be the last Americans to face detention or torture in North Korea.Decision to withdraw from #IranDeal will undermine our national security, increase prospect of a nuclear Iran or a conflict with them, and cause the world to conclude America doesn't keep its word. Scuttling the deal without a Plan B is not a strategy, but a dangerous abdication: https://t.co/QMzc9z1z2JGiuliani‚Äôs embarrassing effort to explain what Trump knew and when he knew it, is a useful reminder that no one who works with the President leaves with an improved reputation for integrity or truthfulness. Why are so many willing to debase themselves for a seat at Trump‚Äôs table?Pulling out of Iran Deal with no Plan B makes conflict with Iran more likely and means that America can‚Äôt be counted on to keep its word. It‚Äòs also exactly the wrong move as we enter negotiations with North Korea.

I asked the Intel Community to provide an assessment to Congress: https://t.co/o70e6Z2PL8Given all the secret meetings with the Russians, the denials, the false statements, and the guilty pleas, your attacks on the Republican, respected, decorated, Vietnam Veteran running the investigation could not be more false, or transparent. https://t.co/spipVhx6uJWhat Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders are doing ‚Äî taking the President‚Äôs abundant falsehoods and trying to weave them into some alternate ‚Äútruth‚Äù ‚Äî is corrosive to our democracy and among the most destructive features of this Administration.While President Trump can't be charged with lying to the American people, his false statements about hush money payments can be used as evidence that the President knew he was violating campaign finance laws. False statements are often powerful proof of a consciousness of guilt. https://t.co/zlflggKPU3President Trump must comply with any subpoena from Special Counsel Mueller, and if Trump‚Äôs legal team tries to fight that in court, they are going to lose. https://t.co/hNIDRPy7UoLiftoff for @NASAInSight!

Another complete capitulation. https://t.co/nfOGFAa8P0For a former U.S. Attorney like Giuliani to call the FBI ‚Äústormtroopers‚Äù and urge the Attorney General to investigate the DOJ, shows there is no limit to the destruction the President‚Äôs allies will wreak to protect him and their place at the seat of power. https://t.co/n7is2RIfwTThe President and his allies in Congress fool no one. @POTUS has no interest in DOJ records apart from the light they shed on his exposure.

Russia ranks 83rd of 100 countries for press freedom, and reporters who challenge the Kremlin repeatedly pay with their lives. https://t.co/PEHIJFwKLJThis morning I praised the Administration‚Äôs decision to impose sanctions on Russia over their support of Assad‚Äôs chemical weapons attack against his own people. That praise was, sadly, undeserved, as the President has ordered an about-face. https://t.co/mlPgYE36WVI have serious differences with James Comey over his handling of the email investigation, but on two points, I am in solid agreement: Donald Trump does not reflect the values of America and is morally unfit to be President.Here‚Äôs the fundamental problem, Mr. President: After 17 years at war in Afghanistan, 15 years in Iraq, and now 7 years of war in Syria, the mission is seldom accomplished. Something you should consider before embroiling us further. https://t.co/sWKBP31DBOScooter Libby's pardon is meant to send a message to potential witnesses against Trump. That's why I‚Äôve drafted a bill requiring that in any case with a pardon in which the president‚Äôs implicated, investigatory files must be given to Congress to see if it‚Äôs obstruction of justice https://t.co/WXC2wWMaqQBashar al-Assad‚Äôs chemical weapons attack against his own people merited a strong international response ‚Äî these attacks must not be tolerated. However morally justified, the strikes risk serious escalation. Absent congressional authorization, they are also on thin legal ground.On the day the President wrongly attacks Comey for being a ‚Äúleaker and liar‚Äù he considers pardoning a convicted leaker and liar, Scooter Libby. This is the President‚Äôs way of sending a message to those implicated in the Russia investigation: You have my back and I‚Äòll have yours.The President considers firing the Attorney General, Deputy AG, and Special Counsel and the House Intel Chair considers impeaching the FBI Director ‚Äî all to obstruct an investigation into wrongdoing by the President or those around him. 

@SpeakerRyan response: I‚Äôm outta here.As @POTUS considers military action in response to the Assad regime‚Äôs chemical attack, the legal basis for any strike should be a primary consideration, not an afterthought. Trump Admin still hasn‚Äôt explained basis for the 2017 strike. The President‚Äôs authority is not unlimited.Poor relations with Russia were caused by Russia‚Äôs violation of our sovereignty, not the investigation of it. And their support for Assad and invasion of Ukraine. 

Given that Russia‚Äôs intervention was on your behalf, the conflict of interest is clearly yours, not Mueller‚Äôs. https://t.co/Ic6k7uS7FBMueller should subpoena Deutsche Bank if he has reason to believe it would lead to evidence Russians laundered money through Trump Organization. The President has no authority to draw a red line or fire Mueller simply because a particular investigative lead might incriminate him. https://t.co/pKAIFi0AJ6Firing Rod Rosenstein because he approved a warrant that may produce evidence against the President or his lawyer is nothing more than a blatant attempt to obstruct justice.

Either way, his bogus claim of voter fraud is repugnant. https://t.co/Uj8cSAwoUxAnother day, another terrible decision for the environment.

The lack of a serious investigation by the GOP is an invitation to the Russians to do it again.Bush, Obama and Clinton may lack your ‚Äúsmarts,‚Äù but they didn‚Äôt need their staff to tell them DO NOT CONGRATULATE a man who helps North Korea evade sanctions, props up a murderer in Syria, invades his neighbors, and who just used nerve agent in Britain. https://t.co/PIyrthKyduThe President calls Putin ‚Äî not to condemn him for using a nerve agent in Britain or interfering in our election ‚Äî but to congratulate him on winning an election in which his top opponent was prohibited from running.

Just what the White House needs: another big dose of unreality.The bombings that have terrorized Austin residents, killing two and injuring others, are horrific. The Federal government must provide all appropriate assistance to bring the perpetrators to justice before there are more victims.To my House and Senate colleagues:

If the President causes a constitutional crisis by firing Mueller, no one can credibly claim that they could not see it coming. The time to speak out, to defend our system of checks and balances, is now.It‚Äôs easy to get 73% of the vote when you bar your "opponents" from running. After extolling life tenure for China‚Äôs Xi, will our President now congratulate Putin on his successful elimination of democratic opposition?No way yet to evaluate the rush to fire Andrew McCabe, but each FBI official who corroborates Comey on the issue of potential obstruction has been targeted by Trump and his allies in Congress ‚Äî McCabe is only the latest example. This is no coincidence. https://t.co/EmktUPxWhTTrump‚Äôs call, through his lawyer, to shut down Mueller comes after news he is probing ties between Trump‚Äôs business and the Russians. 

Democrats and Republicans must speak out NOW against firing Mueller and FOR an independent counsel law - not wait for a constitutional crisis. https://t.co/1RWc1Yb9mJYou seem to have forgotten, Mr. President, that there is at least one very notable Republican on Mueller‚Äôs team ‚Äî Mueller. And his boss, Rod Rosenstein, appointed by Bush. And his boss, Jeff Sessions, also Republican and chosen by ... you. https://t.co/fg4MgQuWD8Mr. President, the Committee reached no such conclusion ‚Äî only Republicans. In fact, we did find evidence of collusion, despite GOP members being more interested in protecting you than learning the truth. When accusing others of lying, best not to misrepresent facts yourself. https://t.co/fIuKPGyEN1The President, through his lawyer, called on DOJ to end Mueller probe. Obstruction of justice is no less a threat to our democracy when done in the open than behind closed doors. Every representative should condemn this flagrant abuse of power or stop pretending devotion to duty. https://t.co/YtwUXeOW23In the absence of the IG report, it‚Äôs impossible to evaluate the merits of this harsh treatment of a 21-year FBI professional. That it comes after the President urged the DOJ to deprive McCabe of his pension, and after his testimony, gives the action an odious taint. https://t.co/rpZqqxFp4uTreasury will finally punish Russian individuals who, for the most part, were already indicted or subject to sanctions. This from the President who said he was tougher on Russia than Obama. These sanctions will send a message to Russia, just not the one we want to send.Trump refuses to personally condemn Russia over the poisoning of individuals in Britain. Had a Russian nerve agent been used on someone in our country, could we count on on our President to speak out then? What would it take?Today, students all over the country, including my son, walked out of their schools demanding lawmakers support gun safety measures like universal background checks, age requirements and an assault weapons ban.

If Russians have leverage over the President, GOP has decided that it would rather not know. The minority's work continues: https://t.co/oOf13n75VoActually, Mr. President, there‚Äôs overwhelming political support for gun safety reform, including age limits, universal background checks, and an assault weapon ban.

‚ÄîTrump instructed McGahn to falsely claim President never ordered Mueller fired

‚ÄîTrump helped craft the false statement about the meeting in Trump Tower

If true, both actions shed light on the issue of obstruction &amp; corrupt intent.We'll need to interview George Nader &amp; receive further testimony and documents from Erik Prince. Prince‚Äôs testimony is inconsistent with reports that the Seychelles meeting was part of an effort to set up a backchannel to Russia. It'd be negligent of us not to find out the truth.First, the President and Attorney General Sessions supported state efforts to disenfranchise minority voters. 

Now, they sue California to stop us from protecting vulnerable immigrant families. 

Justice may be blind, but the rest of us see a deeply distributing pattern.It's been difficult to find good news this past year. But word that North Korea may enter negotiations towards denuclearization is a rare bright spot.
 
Given their track record, we need to approach talks with eyes wide open, but even the possibility is a positive step forward. https://t.co/o2aB2AYHk1No cabinet meeting devoted to protecting 2018 elections from foreign interference.

If McMaster can stand up to Putin, why can‚Äôt you? https://t.co/ixjsjMJSVJTo those who have been wondering how ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù might be charged, the Special Counsel has now given us a good indication: 
 
https://t.co/crQ7QTLHm9 https://t.co/Rv5451NyTyNo, Mr. President. The Special Counsel‚Äôs indictment states no conclusion on issue of collusion or electoral impact of Russian interference on the election.

This is not executive privilege, this is stonewalling. He must be held in contempt.With the failure to pass an immigration bill in the Senate today, and time running out before the President starts deporting DREAMers next month, it‚Äôs time for @SpeakerRyan to allow a vote on the Dream Act.No, Mr. Vice President, that‚Äôs false. The Intelligence Community reached no conclusion as to whether Russia‚Äôs actions had a determinative effect on the election‚Äôs outcome. For you and the President to continue saying it did, gravely misrepresents their work. https://t.co/xa5MA2GOPAMy heart is broken again ‚Äî this time for the victims of the Parkland school shooting, and the families whose children will not come home today.

Republicans voted against both.
 
The interest was not oversight, it was a political hit job on the FBI in the service of the President: https://t.co/LJD3qLGPw6Even the misleading memo by Republicans demonstrates that the origin of this investigation involved Papadopoulos not Page, and involved collusion with the Russians: https://t.co/E2LainMNIkQuite the opposite, Mr. President. The most important fact disclosed in this otherwise shoddy memo was that FBI investigation began July 2016 with your advisor, Papadopoulos, who was secretly discussing stolen Clinton emails with the Russians. https://t.co/2rGOE1jGg2The President‚Äôs decision to publicly release a misleading memo attacking DOJ &amp; FBI is a transparent attempt to discredit these institutions and undermine Mueller‚Äôs probe.

There were dozens of DREAMers at the #SOTU tonight who could teach him a lot about immigrants.Committee Republicans JUST voted to declassify their spin "memo" and prohibit release of the Democratic response in what they claimed was ‚Äúthe interests of full transparency.‚Äù It was transparent alright ‚Äì transparently cynical and destructive.The same President who excoriated Clinton after FBI found her handling of classified info extremely careless, now urges release of classified info that DOJ has called ‚Äúextraordinarily reckless.‚Äù He‚Äôs consistent ‚Äî consistently self-serving.It comes as no surprise that @POTUS would place his own interests ahead of the country.

Have a listen and let me know what you think: https://t.co/JOlpwhfA4jI just voted NO on the Republican tax plan. Here's why:

I voted no on this bill because, simply put, it overwhelmingly benefits large corporations and families with large incomes and estates, while doing little for most families, especially those in California. https://t.co/lb9Cxt39kqWith the president continuing to claim that the investigations have produced no evidence of collusion, it is worth examining the public record after nine months of work.
 
Reality diverges sharply from Mr. Trump‚Äôs vehement denials.
 
https://t.co/9trKofzHoNMake no mistake: After they borrow $1.5 trillion to pass a windfall tax break for corporations and the rich, Trump, Ryan, and McConnell will seek cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay it back.Sending my deepest condolences to the victims and families affected by today‚Äôs train derailment in Washington State. Hopefully results of the ongoing investigation will ensure a horrific accident like this never happens again.Trump just made his most self-serving deal ever ‚Äì the tax bill. With its decrease in the top rate, its pass through income and estate tax cuts, his family stands to make more money than all of their previous deals combined.Much of the damage done by the President can be undone, but lifetime appointments to the federal bench for unqualified ideologues will do lasting harm. https://t.co/BgPlittKYs@SpeakerRyan @POTUS By shutting down the congressional investigations when they continue to discover new and important evidence, the White House can exert tremendous pressure to end or curtail Mueller‚Äôs investigation or cast doubt on it. We cannot let that happen.@SpeakerRyan @POTUS Beyond our investigation, here‚Äôs what has me really concerned: The attacks on Mueller, DOJ and FBI this week make it clear they plan to go after Mueller‚Äôs investigation. 

Aggressively and soon.The responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation, or to prevent one, ultimately falls on @SpeakerRyan. I‚Äôm concerned he's heeding the calls of Bannon and @POTUS to ‚ÄúDO SOMETHING‚Äù by closing down the Russia investigation &amp; opening up another investigation of Hilary Clinton.Despite our repeated urging, Majority has declined to issue subpoenas in numerous avenues of the investigation, where there's simply no other way to get the information. Some refusals we‚Äôve made public, like witnesses hiding behind nonexistent privileges, many others we haven‚Äôt.Next week, they scheduled critical witness interviews out of state, when we are voting on the tax bill and vital government funding bills and no Members will be able to ask questions, in an effort to squeeze them in before end of year. 

These witnesses are willing to come to DC.It appears Republicans want to conduct just enough interviews to give the impression of a serious investigation.Yet, Republicans have scheduled no witnesses after next Friday and none in 2017. We have dozens of outstanding witnesses on key aspects of our investigation that they refuse to contact and many document requests they continue to sit on.Since March, our investigation has made important progress. We‚Äôve interviewed numerous key witnesses behind closed doors, held public hearings, reviewed thousands of documents, identified new leads ‚Äî all to understand and expose Russia's meddling and protect our democracy.I‚Äôm increasingly worried Republicans will shut down the House Intelligence Committee investigation at the end of the month. 

Here‚Äôs why:‚ÄúThe president‚Äôs daily brief ... is often structured to avoid upsetting him.‚Äù

Please tell me they are not referring to our commander in chief, the man that is supposed to be leader of the free world. https://t.co/IaGXH5cbOUToday‚Äôs hearing, in which the President‚Äôs allies sought to put Mueller, the FBI and DOJ on trial, again demonstrates that the greatest threat to our democracy is from within.

We wish you a peaceful and joyous Festival of Lights.To those, including our President, who have endorsed an alleged pedophile because he will support a tax cut for the wealthy, should we not ask: ‚ÄúFor what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?‚ÄùThe President and his allies are making a concerted effort to discredit Mueller, the FBI, the DOJ and judiciary. @POTUS seeks to protect himself by undermining our institutions and tearing at the very idea there is an objective truth: https://t.co/zODM8mH8K0Here is what we know:

The Russians offered help.
