Today I am joining with families, community leaders, and elected officials to shine a light on the administration’s abhorrent polices. We are saying loud and clear that #FamiliesBelongTogether.Family separation and mass family detention are a part of an even larger systematic assault on immigrant communities. We cannot stand idly by in the face of clear human rights violations.The Trump Administration's zero tolerance policy is insidious &amp; un-American. It is our duty to care for the youngest &amp; most vulnerable among us. Separating children from their parents and incarcerating families for an indefinite period of time is directly counter to our values. https://t.co/UigoGyPq1XBe like @BillNye – the Science Guy – sign up for my E-Newsletter to stay in touch! https://t.co/bjt6wSbjf9 https://t.co/lEVMOshGA2The #SCOTUS is no longer a judicial body. It is an arm of the Republican Party.

Every decision they’ve made has simply been a rubber stamp for the Republican agenda. #JanusvsAFSCMEThe President has decided that we must be hostile to immigrants and Congressional Republicans have chosen to align themselves with his fear-mongering, xenophobic agenda. He is trying to use this as a wedge issue to misinform and terrify people, and we cannot allow him to do so.We can reunite families, give #Dreamers a path to citizenship, and work together toward comprehensive immigration reform.We can process asylum requests &amp; use alternatives to detention for individuals and families awaiting their immigration proceedings, like the successful Family Case Management Program the President chose to abruptly end, despite its proven success.To say that we are limited to only those options, and to refuse to bring up the multitude of legislative proposals that have bipartisan support, is deeply disingenuous. We have clear alternatives.This administration &amp; Republicans want you to believe that we only have two choices when it comes to immigration enforcement: we either must separate families &amp; incarcerate immigrants, much like we did to Japanese Americans during WWII, or else we will have ‘open borders’ &amp; crimeNeither piece of legislation presented any real solutions to fixing our broken immigration system, providing a path to citizenship for Dreamers, or reuniting children with their parents after being unjustly separated at the border.The so-called ‘compromise’ immigration bill that failed to pass the House this week was not a compromise at all – not a single Democrat was consulted in the drafting of the bill. This bill had no significant differences from the Goodlatte bill which also failed to pass last week.I stand with unions and their continued efforts to improve the lives of hardworking Americans across the country. #Union https://t.co/h1484pBQ7vAt a time when the disparity of wealth is highest in our nation's recent history, labor unions should be able to advocate for expanding equality of opportunity and to support the fight for justice for all.Labor unions contributed to the creation of America’s middle class, and today are one of the most important means by which working people can push back against economic forces that are increasingly rigged against the working class.As the son of a union worker I understand how important unions are in the lives of American workers &amp; their families. I strongly support workers' rights. I learned firsthand from my father, that the right to organize &amp; bargain for better working conditions is extremely importantThe ability to organize and collectively bargain for benefits is one of the most important advances in American labor law and has been a major factor in the creation of a robust middle class in our country.The #JanusvsAFSCME ruling is an attack on public sector workers &amp; their right to organize &amp; collectively bargain for better working conditions. The decision undermines unions’ ability to work on behalf of &amp; be supported by workers who benefit from collective representation.As #PrideMonth comes to an end, we celebrate #LGBTEqualityDay. Three years ago today, same-sex marriage became legal in all states!  On this anniversary, we resolve to continue the fight for full equality for all LGBT people. https://t.co/jHV319mfjM@POTUS's Muslim Ban is part of a continued pattern of promoting policies that further alienate the US &amp; shut us off from the rest of the world, all while making us no safer. Despite today’s ruling - I'll continue to fight discrimination &amp; discriminatory policies. #NoMuslimBanEverReligious freedom is a core American value. Today's #SCOTUS decision flies in the face of that &amp; puts the religious liberty of ALL Americans at risk.The Equality Act would extend existing civil rights protections to #LGBTQ people by prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity across key areas of life. I join @HRC in urging my colleagues to pass this vital legislation today. #EqualityForward https://t.co/3CvyRSnLVnhttps://t.co/hwk4MffwCC https://t.co/DKONBfIZ9hI thank Congressman @davereichert for his stalwart leadership, the @MTSGreenway for their tireless advocacy, and the engaged community members that made it possible for us to join together in preserving this natural treasure.The Mountains to Sound Greenway will help preserve and promote the area’s scenery, resources and history for future generations.The passage of the Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage Area Act, the first such designation in the Pacific Northwest, reflects the sustainable relationship between Washington state residents and nature in the Puget Sound Region.Since #SCOTUS decided Shelby County v. Holder five years ago, more than two dozen states have enacted anti-voter laws that make it harder to register and more difficult to cast your ballot. Every American must be guaranteed a voice in our democracy – we must #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/e8gw088YKwThere is absolutely no reason for asylum seeking families to languish in detention facilities while they await the outcome of their cases. We need to pass the Dignity for Detained Immigrants into law to reform our immigration system and keep families together.Our legislation would put an end to the administration’s abuses of the immigration detention system and allow individuals and families to live outside of detention while they await their immigration proceedings.I introduced the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act to address the systemic problems in our immigration detention system. In light of the Administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” and the June 20th Executive Order, I'm honored to have @SenBooker introduce a Senate companion bill.The problem that we face today is twofold: our immigration system is broken, and the way Donald Trump is choosing to enforce existing immigration laws is dead wrong. On multiple occasions, the President has created immigration crises that unjustly target immigrant children. https://t.co/6WwFIJSp0GAs the administration continues to confuse and deceive the American people on this critical issue, these families cannot wait. We must take up and pass the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act.My bill would create special protections for young people, primary caregivers, survivors of torture and gender-based violence, and asylum seekers, and allow children and families to live outside of detention as they await the outcome of their cases.The bills exacerbate the family separation &amp; detention crisis by allowing for the indefinite detention of both unaccompanied children &amp; family units.
My bill, the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, would end the Trump Administration’s abuses of the immigration detention system.Both these bills failed to present any real solution for the #DACA crisis, leaving #DREAMers’ lives in limbo. These bills would also have authorized funding for the ill-conceived border wall, drastically slashed legal immigration, &amp; destroyed our family-based immigration system.Clearly this crisis is continuing unabated, despite what this administration would have you believe. This week, I adamantly opposed the Republican immigration bills that were brought before the House of Representatives.With his new EO issued this week the President claims he is “ending family separation” – a crisis of his own creation. In reality, he is replacing family separation w/ mass incarceration of children &amp; families with no clear plan to reunited thousands of children w/ their parents.Learn more here ➡️https://t.co/nQ09OuBFON 

Read our letter HERE ➡️https://t.co/CSCQ3rdB7AI'll continue to do everything I can to stop this administration’s inhumane policy toward children &amp; their families. It’s unconscionable that we are even in this position in the first place. We must hold the federal gov accountable for the care of children within their custody.As Ranking Member of @HASCDemocrats, I joined Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Reed in sending a letter to Secretary Mattis requesting assurances that Members of Congress will be able to conduct necessary oversight over any DoD sites used to house migrant children.The Pentagon has confirmed that it will be making room to house 20,000 migrant children on military bases across the country, underscoring the need for robust Congressional oversight.Americans with pre-existing conditions should not face discrimination. Period. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/46n8LWTqX7.@SecNielsen and @realDonaldTrump: Democrats and Republicans in Congress, together with the American people want to know: #WhereAreTheGirls?

https://t.co/3kk3OStonDMany of the migrant girls came to the U.S. fleeing violence back home. Tearing them away from their families only exacerbates their trauma. #KeepFamiliesTogetherWe honor #WorldRefugeeDay in the midst of a humanitarian crisis at our own borders.  Today and every day we must stand in solidarity with all refugees, and uphold our nation’s promise of freedom for all. https://t.co/WcJmPa8yM0Today I introduced the Aviation Impacted Communities Act. I have worked directly with impacted communities &amp; taken extensive action to mitigate noise and environmental impacts in the 115th Congress. You can read more about this issue and the bill here ➡️https://t.co/yE83PWr3uqThis has been the case even as many other areas have experienced reduced overall noise burdens. The concerns of residents of these increasingly impacted areas are not being adequately addressed.As airline travel has increased, communities near airports across the country have been experiencing an increased and disproportionate share of noise and other environmental impacts stemming from commercial aviation.I support @RepJerryNadler's #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct because we need to do everything possible to stop the practice of family separation and #KeepFamiliesTogether. Families belong together &amp; the Administration’s degradation of the parent-child relationship is cruel and inhumane.FACT: Family separation has been universally condemned by the child welfare community, immigrant rights advocates, and medical professionals. Today my colleagues and I gathered on the House steps to represent the voices of our constituents who support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct https://t.co/Jbs7CW4zIKHappy #Juneteenth! As we commemorate the end of slavery in our country, we recognize how far we have come and how far we have yet to go.  In Congress, I will continue to fight for the civil rights and liberties of all Americans. 
 
https://t.co/CVSoKECLVVTo be clear, the President could end this policy at any time without an act of Congress. In in light of his unwillingness to do so we must immediately take up &amp; pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act. We must do everything in our power to stop the child abuse occurring at the border.Today, I am proud to join over 190 of my colleagues in cosponsoring the Keep Families Together Act. This legislation would bring an end to the unconscionable practice of separating children from their parents and would limit criminal prosecutions for asylum seekers..@DHSgov Sec Nielsen wants you to believe that these stories are one-offs, but @ICEgov &amp; @CBP have separated hundreds of children from their parents, many of whom are being detained at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac. I am fighting w/ my colleagues to #EndFamilySeparationSeeking asylum is not illegal; in fact, it is written into US laws to ensure that those with a credible fear of persecution can present their case. Moms, dads &amp; children must have a fair process &amp; the ability to seek asylum without being separated. https://t.co/3NzRXt5oGQEugenie’s work with the Girl Up organization will make the Bellevue community and the Ninth District proud!

Empowering girls to be leaders in our communities is an incredibly important mission.The Trump Administration’s relentless attacks on immigrant communities goes against everything we stand for as a country. I remain committed to defending this program and protecting DACA recipients from deportation. #ProtectDreamersIn September 2017, President Trump created an unnecessary crisis by terminating the program, causing tremendous harm to many young people and their families. #DREAMers are integral members of our communities and for many, the United States is the only place they call home.Six years ago, the #DACA program was created to provide much-needed deportation relief to immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.Eid al-Fitr marks the last day of #Ramadan. It is a celebration of the disciplined fasting that occurs during the month of Ramadan. I am proud to stand with Muslims Americans in the Ninth Congressional District and around the world to celebrate this important holiday #EidMubarak https://t.co/6a6x1NQhcPTo have a policy of separating parents from their children is inhumane and goes against every value we as Americans hold dear.

I condemn the Trump Administration’s zero-tolerance policy of separating immigrant families.I am deeply disturbed by reports that a number of women who are seeking asylum are being detained at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac after being separated from their children.Any further delay is detrimental to these young people’s lives as well as to our country as a whole.

Roughly 265,000 low-income kids will lose access to meals at school because of the #GOPFarmBill.

I applaud my colleague Congressman Ellison for speaking out about this important issue.Remittances are not only relied upon by countless families in these countries to meet their essential needs, but also help stabilize the economies of many countries experiencing violence and famine.The recent news report from FOX 9 in Minnesota regarding lawful remittance transfers is both misleading and offensive. Remittances are critically important for individuals and families throughout the U.S. to be able to support their families in fragile nations like Somalia.Muslim Americans contribute greatly to our nation, and it is important that all communities remain a safe and welcoming space for diverse religious expression.

Our national parks should be accessible to everyone. Thank you to all those who made their voices heard on this issue!We must continue to ensure that the United States is a safe haven for everyone. On this day of remembrance, I join my constituents in the 9th Congressional District, and with those around the world, in honoring the memory of those lost in the Holocaust.#HolocaustRemembranceDay is a somber reminder of the millions who were murdered during this horrific period in our world’s history. These tragic events have continued to shape the world and today, it is more important than ever that we work to combat xenophobia &amp; anti-Semitism https://t.co/vX607NBOFSThough Reverend McKinney has passed away, his legacy and advocacy for equal rights of African-Americans will remain ever present in the Greater Seattle community. https://t.co/VIkQOMBNgqHe helped establish the first black-owned bank to challenge practices such as restricted loans. He also co-founded the Seattle Opportunities Industrialization Center, a vocational training organization.When he arrived in Seattle, he witnessed systematic injustices such as discrimination, redlining, high unemployment among African-Americans. Reverend McKinney established numerous organizations and businesses to combat discrimination.A former classmate of Dr. King's he played a fundamental role in Dr. King’s trip to Seattle. As spiritual leader for many in the African-American community in Seattle, Reverend McKinney understood that for African-Americans to be fully empowered they must be uplifted economicallyWith the passing of Rev. Dr. Samuel B. McKinney, our community has lost an instrumental leader of the civil rights movement.  After moving to Seattle in 1957 to become a pastor in the historic Mount Zion Baptist Church, Reverend McKinney was a pastor in the church for over 40 yrsTo stay updated on my work in Congress, sign up for my newsletter here: https://t.co/bjt6wRTInB https://t.co/GsFmJNeOPYAs your representative in D.C. it is critically important that I hear directly from you about the issues important to you and your family. Town Hall meetings are a great opportunity to hear from you, and you can also contact my offices anytime with your questions or concerns.I discussed my continued work to find a solution for the thousands impacted by the President’s actions to end #DACA. Constituents asked questions on climate change, proposals by the Parkland students to address gun violence, and questions on Russian interference in our elections.Thank you to everyone who attended my Town Hall in Federal Way. This community meeting was an opportunity to share updates on my bill to protect airport communities from ultrafine particles as well as my recent introduction of a bill to prohibit No First Use of Nuclear Weapons,https://t.co/fTExevrbJYI am a proud cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen and provide further protections against wage disparities. These efforts are imperative to providing a level playing field, recognizing that we have a long way to go to achieve full gender equality.#EqualPayDay serves a reminder of the pay gap that still persists in almost all work sectors. Women who work full-time continue to earn 20 percent less than men. The pay gap continues to inhibit women from achieving full opportunities in the workforce.Right now, you may still be able to apply to renew your #DACA status.

Read my full statement here ➡️https://t.co/YyVc9If62rPresident Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard to the border is an ill-conceived, unnecessary stunt that inappropriately militarizes the issue of immigration enforcement. He appears to have based his decision largely on reports disseminated by conservative talk shows.With Herb’s passing, we lost a compassionate leader who sought to build bridges between people and improve our community for everyone.  https://t.co/GKMJDRRCX5I am deeply saddened by the passing of Herb Bridge. Herb embodied the best ideals of our region: compassion through philanthropy, equality for all through the ongoing fight for civil rights, and patriotism through military service.The anniversary of his death should also serve as a day to spark dialogue and action that will continue Dr. King’s vision of economic and racial equity. #MLK50 https://t.co/B6Q5gabQSRToday marks a time in U.S. history that we should reflect on and acknowledge the critical work Dr. Martin Luther King led to ensure equal rights for all Americans.My staff enjoyed meeting with the @AlaskaAir Black Employee Business Resource Group who were recently in DC.

We need to follow through and give as a strong statement as possible, so we can see the laws changed in this country. https://t.co/BosCHxqMnaWell the students from Parkland seem to show us that standing up and speaking out can make a difference. Representative democracy does work. Sometimes it takes an aggravating amount of time, but I will say that you have to be patient and persistent.We’ve had tragedy after tragedy and many of us who are strong advocates for gun control have become discouraged. To be honest, when you see something like Sandy Hook happening, and no policy change follow, you wonder what is it going to take?I really want to thank the #ParklandStudents for all the leadership they have shown in the gun control debate. They have moved the needle in the way that really hasn’t happened before. #EnoughisEnough #NeverAgain #StudentsDemandActionSo we are going to have to really keep a close eye on John Bolton and speak out strongly against policies that would lead us into wars that we don’t need to be in. Check out my full video statement here ➡️https://t.co/5sLkQpakaxJohn Bolton is every little bit as out of touch with reality as the President is. And we don’t need two people like that overseeing the national security of this country and the stability and peacefulness of the world.He’s willing to be far more belligerent all across the globe. He thinks that we don’t need to work with any other countries. He thinks the US ought to be able to force and impose its will on everybody else. That is an enormous mistake &amp; terrible direction for our foreign policyI am very concerned about President Trump’s appointment of John Bolton as the new National Security Advisor. Bolton is very much in favor with of going to war with just about everybody, but has specifically come out and said we should attack Iran, we should attack North Korea.Read my full statement in opposition to the bill here ➡️https://t.co/AZv5qv0gGuToday the House passed an omnibus spending bill that funds the federal gov through the end of September. This bill will give more certainty to our federal agencies, but unfortunately it underfunds key areas &amp; takes us further down our current path of fiscal irresponsibility.Mueller needs to be protected and I’ll do everything I can as a member of Congress to make sure that he is.

Check out my full video statement here - https://t.co/WNwd3CjDqGThey try to spread fake news stories to undermine policies that they think would be contrary to their best interests. We need to fight back against that. The first step would be understanding what they are doing. Nobody is getting at the core of that more than Robert Mueller.It’s critical that he does it. Even independent of how it may impact people associated with the Trump campaign, the Russians aren’t stopping. They are planning on interfering in our 2018 election, they interfere in our political decisions.this would clearly be an obstruction of justice and a matter critical to the United State. And if that was the case, the President should be impeached. But I hope it doesn’t come to that. I hope the President lets our special prosecutor, Robert Mueller do his job.I support prohibiting the President from having any way to get at the Special prosecutor, Mueller needs to be able to do his job. What happens if the President goes down this route? I think Senator Graham said it best, he said that it would be an impeachable offense and I agree.It is deeply concerning that Trump has increased his criticism of Mueller &amp; also increased his criticism of the FBI &amp; the Intelligence community. Undermining the basic institutions that underpin our society is not good for the country &amp; more importantly, the President is wrong.This legislation will allow LGBTQ students to learn in a more safe &amp; welcoming environment, enabling them to thrive academically &amp; socially.
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the #SNDA. All children should have access to education free from discrimination. #LetKidsLearnThe Student Non-Discrimination Act, modeled after the Title IX protections, would establish a federal prohibition of discrimination in public schools for students who are discriminated against based on actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity.Currently, civil rights protections do not explicitly include sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of explicit protection can lead to limited legal recourse for students who are discriminated against solely because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.LGBTQ students are faced with harassment, bullying and at times, violence in the classroom every day. This discrimination not only has a negative impact on their education, but also on their well-being. https://t.co/G4oTsvyzGADespite the winter weather in Washington, D.C. and the Federal Government closures, my Rayburn office is open. We look forward to seeing the constituents in town from Washington's 9th Congressional District!I appreciated the students’ willingness to share their personal stories and thank them for their continued advocacy to ensure that all children have a healthy start and access to education opportunities to succeed. https://t.co/2dVeW2KGNvGreat to meet with local representatives of @SavetheChildren in my Washington, D.C. office in town from Federal Way and Seattle.

The Hello Girls provided crucial support that connected the front lines with the supply and military command. Despite these heroic efforts, The Hello Girls did not receive veteran status for sixty years.In honor of #InternationalWomensDay I want to recognize a group of women whose achievements have been overlooked for too long: The Hello Girls of WWI.

https://t.co/9yIQLVfxApAs the disparity of wealth is at its highest in our nation's recent history, we need to be supporting organized labor so that it can advocate for working people and expand equality of opportunity.I strongly support the right to organize and also recognize that the benefits that labor unions fight to achieve extend benefits throughout the economy and workforce.The right of workers to organize &amp; collectively bargain has been one of the most important advances in our history &amp; is as critical today as ever. In both the public &amp; private sector, hard fought advancements in workers’ rights have been the direct result of union advocacy.Today, we acknowledge the disparity in pay of Asian and Pacific Islander women. We must continue to work to find solutions that provide greater educational and economic opportunities for AAPI women.  These efforts will work to bridge the pay gap. #AAPIEqualPay #wagegapYou can read more about this issue, and my work with our community leaders in a recent @CityLab article here: https://t.co/e48hZuwmYY#Climatechange and pollution have both risen to the level of a public health crisis.

In doing so, we remain committed to preserving the civil rights and creating social progress to ensure equal protections for all.
