ICYMI: Last week, I spoke on the House floor about this cruel, inhumane practice. Watch here --&gt; https://t.co/PP4MleSJz8Trump’s zero-tolerance policy has created so much trauma for young children and their families. I am outraged about this, something must be done to reunite these families and fix our broken immigration system.This goes against the spirit of the federal law signed 36 years ago today by President Reagan. Voting is crucial to America’s democracy, and it is up to all of us to protect this right, not suppress it. #votingrightsThe anniversary of the 1982 Voting Rights Act amendments could not occur at a more pivotal time. The NC General Assembly has put voter ID requirements on the November ballot, which would enshrine discrimination in our state constitution. https://t.co/5LwA4uLneLToday, I presented the “One Meck” Community Recognition Award to Cindy Quinlan, Director of Youth 4 Abolition. Our community thanks you, Cindy, for the work you do to stem the tide of human trafficking in our region and our nation! #Youth4Abolition #humantrafficing #humanrights https://t.co/5DifHyU4PVMy deepest condolences are with everyone impacted by the shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Gun violence is an issue that plagues our communities, and I hope that Congress can find a comprehensive solution to prevent these tragedies.https://t.co/AeUK5dqRLE49 years ago the Stonewall Riots ignited the fight for LGBTQ rights, but in 2018, the Trump administration threatens the progress that has been made.

https://t.co/uaOC6URpYwToday is National HIV Testing Day. Research shows that Mecklenburg County has high rates of new HIV infections, which is one reason why the Mecklenburg County Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will offer free HIV testing.Women's rights, voting rights, workers rights, healthcare rights, LGBTQ rights and all of our civil rights will be under attack if we don't demand a moderate nominee.We must demand a nominee that will uphold our law and values - not party politics.  This #SCOTUS pick will decide cases that will impact the key rights that we have fought for.Kennedy's retirement will have a monumental impact. We know that without intervention, @POTUS will nominate someone who's hyper-conservative &amp; who will further his divisive agenda. We are in dangerous times. https://t.co/gD06ioHZJf@RhonnieF I tip my hat off to you and the entire NC 12 staff! Let's keep elevating this narrative and knock out this NC HBCU Summit to ensure that all of our students have equal access to opportunity.  #whenwomenlead @HBCUCaucusThere are 17.3 million public employees across the country. The Supreme Court’s #Janus decision is a direct attack on their rights. Another clear example of how conservatives are succeeding at rigging the economy against working people.One in five public school teachers have second jobs during the school year. We should be doing more to help these public servants who shape our young people – not taking away tools that help them win a better future. #JanusDiversity and inclusion within every industry is critical, especially on Capitol Hill. In Congress I have worked hard to ensure that everyone has equal access to education and opportunity. Proud that my Chief, @RhonnieF , is a part of this crucial conversation here on the Hill. https://t.co/nTwwqDazL8The Janus decision is a strike to the millions of teachers, police, and fire fighters who unionize to improve wages and working conditions. Today #SCOTUS ruled to suppress their voices and to drive up income inequality. We need a legislative fix immediately. #UnionStrongToday's #SCOTUS decision is another in a long string of hyper-conservative and partisan decisions by this Court.  This ruling is a blatant attack on working women and men. #UnionStrong https://t.co/b6mTrTj9rHI'm troubled by FEMA’s $500,000 cut to 9 Mecklenburg organizations. I wrote to the National Board of the Emergency Food and Shelter Program urging them to reconsider their funding formula &amp; create greater transparency. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/77kwIFyyiO..@realDonaldTrump has set us on a dangerous course that continues to threaten our progress and our core values.  Read my full statement on the Supreme Court's decision upholding Trump's discriminatory travel ban below. https://t.co/5tSVJ40q4T#RoevWade is more vulnerable than ever before. The anti-choice movement is not going to give up—and neither are we in our pledge to #ExposeFakeClinics. Women deserve the truth and transparency when weighing their reproductive health care options. #NIFLAvBecerra https://t.co/8F8fbSm5iVHowever, #LGBTQ individuals can still be fired or denied housing because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. I’m proudly joining the @HRC today to urge my colleagues on the Hill to pass the Equality Act. We must always push to move #EqualityForward.June 26th is Equality Day! It’s a historic day for the rights of #LGBTQ individuals, marking the 3rd anniversary of the #SCOTUS rule in favor of nationwide marriage equality. https://t.co/voJS5uvncZToday marks the third anniversary of Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court case which ruled marriage between same-sex couples as a fundamental right. While we celebrate this victory, we must continue to fight for equal rights in the LGBTQ+ community. #LoveisLoveIn a vote of 5-4, the #SCOTUS has ruled in support of Trump’s xenophobic, intolerant travel ban. It is a somber day when the highest court in the U.S. endorses discrimination and profiling. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/YdGTKbHVqWThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is projected to raise the deficit 1 trillion dollars by 2019. Permanent tax cuts to corporations don’t trickle down to the middle-class. Americans deserve #abetterdeal than this! 

https://t.co/wUBTF3XBEEToday marks the 5th anniversary of the #SCOTUS ruling on the Shelby County V Holder case. This ruling set the advancement of voting rights backwards. I am committed to restoring and maintaining voting rights for everyone, in order to #RestoretheVote.Across the nation, and in the NC state house, the right to vote has been under attack through voter ID laws and purging voter rolls. We must stand firm against repeated attempts to undermine our right to vote. Remember, civic engagement is not only a right, but a responsibility.The Trump Administration has resumed its assault on Americans with pre-existing health conditions, this time removing protections under the ACA. This will weaken the market, and leave millions without health care. The fight is still on to #Protectourcare.I stand in firm opposition to this move, and voiced my concerns on the House floor about Trump’s heartless and immoral immigration policy. We must not lose focus on the fight to #keepfamiliestogether.President Trump has ordered the Pentagon to begin housing children on military bases, but does not have a long-term plan to unite these children with their families. This is absurd.Yesterday was #TheLongestDay, an important day to raise awareness for Alzheimer’s, which is on the rise in the U.S. It is vital that we increase awareness and support critical research on the disease. My office wore purple in support of the @alzassociation. #EndAlz https://t.co/IjCqnPJuExRead my full statement on how the #GOPFarmBill fails America's families. https://t.co/OK8fs16S9bThe #GoodLatteBill is no good, and that is why I'm voting no.  My full statement is below. https://t.co/om7cthobHEThe House is preparing to vote on the Goodlatte Bill, there is nothing good about this heartless measure. It will leave DREAMers and families that @realDonaldTrump has ripped apart behind, while cutting legal immigration. I will not support this bill when it comes to the floor.At 3PM, House Republicans will force a vote on a measure that will take food off the tables of millions of Americans. They claim the #GOPFarmBill doesn’t cut #SNAP. That’s UNTRUE. It cuts $14.1 billion in benefits that families rely on and that is unacceptable. #voteNOGOP cruelty continues. Today, @SpeakerRyan is bringing two hyper-partisan immigration bills &amp; a cruel Farm Bill that guts SNAP to the floor. When will he stop playing politics with our priorities &amp; put forth legislation that addresses our country's needs &amp; adheres to our values?Proud to stand with my Democratic colleagues today as we introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct https://t.co/uUfAYtHXBhLet's be clear, @realDonaldTrump created this crisis.  He doesn't need an Executive Order to end his own practices.  If he wants to correct his wrong then he'd support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct .  We will not be fooled. Read my full statement below. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/U6DoN5JeApToday in Ed and the Workforce, I spoke up for organizations in my District like @CharlotteWorks that work to provide greater opportunity. Congress must support their efforts by listening to their concerns and advocating for real solutions that promote full employment. https://t.co/K95lFbOPJsOn #WorldRefugeeDay let us remember that no one chooses to be a refugee, so we must not choose to turn our backs and close our borders to those seeking refuge.  #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/MGD8MValWMPresident Trump's barbaric immigration tactics must stop.  Broken families don't reflect American values.  Today I proudly stood with families and advocates demanding that Speaker Ryan fix this immigration crisis. https://t.co/lUOcLPN1UYIn the absence of Presidential leadership, Congress must act to bring an end to this Trump policy.  This is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Keep Families Together Act, which would help keep families together. #KeepingFamiliesTogetherThe Trump Administration’s zero-tolerance approach is inhumane and morally reprehensible.  Ripping children from their families strikes at our nation’s values and long standing traditions.Which is why I am a proud original cosponsor of the 2018 Observance of the Historical Significance of Juneteenth Independence Day. https://t.co/IYVVmMrtlPToday marks the 153rd anniversary of Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the state of Texas. Despite the tremendous progress made in expanding the rights of African-Americans, it is important that the history of slavery is never forgotten.The President must end his illegal separation of children from their parents. The damage he is doing to these families and our reputation as a nation is unconscionable. This is his policy, and he has the authority to end it now. Read my full statement here. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/hWZpDGzcEnA new @amprog study found the average family will pay more than $3,000 this year to cover just 5 weeks of summer care. That’s only HALF of the summer break! We need to pass the Child Care For Working Families Act so families can afford #SummerCareThe Trump Justice Department is doing the @HouseGOP’s bidding – attempt to gut the #ACA &amp; take away protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/SnNIMRwof4We're proud to host Jameia this summer!

Hopes and prayers are not enough. Congress must #DoSomething to stop the #GunViolence terrorizing our communities. #EnoughIsEnoughI'm headed to the House floor to vote NO on the #GOPFarmBill. It's not good enough for farmers, consumers, or hungry families.Yesterday during debate on the #GOPFarmBill I went tot the House floor to remind my colleagues of the impact this terrible bill will have on real people in NC-12 &amp; across the nation. Watch here--&gt;https://t.co/rsiu3N6ceeHouse Republicans say that the #GOPFarmBill won't cause anyone to lose their #SNAP benefits but that's not true. In NC, more than 133,000 people are at risk, including 51,000 kids. Nationwide, more than 2 million people at risk of losing #SNAP. #HandsOffSNAPHouse Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn't kick a single person off of #SNAP. That's not true. 265,000 kids will lose access to free and reduced meals at school. #HandsOffSNAPHouse Republicans say that the #GOPFarmBill doesn't cut #SNAP. That's not true. H.R. 2 cuts $9.2 billion in nutrition assistance to create untested &amp; underfunded federally-mandated bureaucracies in states. #HandsOffSNAPAhead of the vote on the #GOPFarmBill, my Republican colleagues have been telling some mistruths about this flawed, partisan bill. Let's set the record straight.#OTD 1954: SCOTUS ruled that segregated schools were illegal. 64 years after this landmark ruling, access to equal education is still one of the major civil rights issues of our time. #BrownvBoard #StandwithStudents https://t.co/VLLzVmITyX@HouseGOP You have a lot of explaining to do. https://t.co/sslJZLrfGVI'm speaking up for the more than 55,000 households in Mecklenburg County &amp; the millions nationwide who depend on #SNAP to put food on their table today on the House floor around 4pm.

We won't be fooled. #HandsOffSNAP@frogger42 You're right, John. These cuts to #SNAP are heartless and bad for our community. I will not support this partisan #FarmBill.My mom is my SHEro.

https://t.co/zTEaI4bp8gSince passing the #GOPTaxScam, Republicans have worked overtime to sell this disastrous legislation to the American people. We’re not buying it. 

https://t.co/TLCjHmKBulIts been 19 years since the horrific school shooting at Columbine High School &amp; Congress has yet to act. Its past time we had the courage to enact common sense reforms to end the epidemic of gun violence sweeping our nation. https://t.co/zxSWLALZ7eTo the brave students who are standing up and speaking out today: I'm with you. You are the change we hope to see in our country. #NationalSchoolWalkoutDay 

https://t.co/rx0LnR9UB2#EarthDay is Sunday! On this day we recommit ourselves to the protection and preservation of our environment, land, water, and wildlife. Earth Day events are held in more than 193 countries worldwide to demonstrate support for environmental protection.Looking forward to working with you to continue moving our schools forward @EagleInChief12! Congrats! https://t.co/bAEV6ki6sGThe inaugural #BMHW may be over but we're just getting started. Thank you to everyone who supported @SenKamalaHarris and my resolutions to raise awareness of this issue in Congress. Read more about next steps below. https://t.co/Rl6rXqWgSwYesterday, during the #farmbill2018 markup I spoke out against the proposed cuts to #SNAP &amp; the disastrous impacts it could have on children and families. Watch my comments here--&gt; https://t.co/eHbyXNK2XcIn addition to kicking people in need off of #SNAP, the GOP proposal takes away NC’s flexibility to administer the program in a way that works for our state by saddling states with an underfunded mandate that would shift costs from the federal government to states. #FarmBillThis is just false. The GOP proposal cuts over $23 BILLION from #SNAP, cutting benefits from and taking food off of the tables of over 2 MILLION people in need. #FarmBill https://t.co/XcRfuRpVZBDarlene from Asheboro, NC became very ill and was out of work for 8 months to seek medical treatment. She used #SNAP benefits to put food on her table while she recovered.Shoshana in Raleigh used food stamps shortly after getting divorced to make ends meet for her and her sons. She worked full time and needed the extra assistance to get back on her feet.Mallory from Fayetteville, NC was laid off from her job and relied on #SNAP to help feed her family for a few months while she looked for a new job.Shae from Knightdale, NC used #SNAP to purchase milk and baby food when her husband lost his job and she was in school.Dee from Durham, NC was raised on #SNAP. Her father was an alcoholic who couldn't hold down a job &amp; her mother was often paid less than her male coworkers. Because of SNAP she was able to feed her 3 children &amp; Dee was able to go onto graduate college &amp; lift herself out of povertyTom from Asheville, NC is a handicapped senior who relies on #SNAP to put nutritious food on his table. Due to his injury, he cannot work.Jenny in Creston, NC is the sole caregiver for her severely disabled husband.  Leaving him alone for hours at a time is not an option. Jenny relies on #SNAP to put food on their table.Many NC families depend on #SNAP to put food on their tables. I'm proud to be their voice in Congress and I'm proud to share their stories today. Thank you to @MomsRising for lifting their stories up as well.I can't imagine that anyone would support taking food away from 265,000 children nationwide. Yet, that's what this proposal does. No one should wonder where their next meal will come from-especially children. #FarmBillI'm a member of the Nutrition Subcommittee and last Thursday was the first time I saw any language about the nutrition title in this bill. How can we possibly say this bill was bipartisan? It was not. #FarmBillIn my opening comments I shared my concerns about this partisan #farmbill. NC is 11th in the nation for food insecurity. In NC-12 nearly 50,000 kids are at risk of going to bed hungry every night. These are not just numbers, these are people. I will not support this flawed bill.The @HouseAgNews is marking up the #FarmBill NOW. Watch live here: https://t.co/S4amJFbIlfI'm proud to work with you to keep moving the ball forward for #HBCUs. Thank you for your friendship and support! https://t.co/BrwhEkC51gMy thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family this evening. Mrs. Bush was a compassionate woman who championed literacy throughout her many years of service to our Nation. https://t.co/HcqfywyVroAg Committee will markup the #FarmBill TOMORROW. In NC-12 alone there are more than 62,000 households who depend on #SNAP to put food on their tables. If you're not fired up yet, you should be! https://t.co/Tn9rzKyZTx#GOPtaxscam that benefited the powerful and privileged will be paid for by cuts to the most vulnerable. We cannot allow the GOP to drastically cut #SNAP funding, fundamentally restructure SNAP, or erect barriers to participation. We must #protectSNAP and help families. #FarmBillEvery dollar invested into #SNAP helps families to combat hunger and generates $1.79 of economic activity. The GOP House farm bill would cut that investment, leading to not only more hunger but a loss of economic activity over ten years. We must #protectSNAP. #FarmBillAs the prices of prescription drugs, gas, and health insurance skyrocket, the #GOPTaxScam isn’t helping NC workers afford these rising expenses. Instead, the top 5% of earners in our state receive 60% of tax breaks. #TaxDay https://t.co/FAAXI9IxbuI'm proud to introduce a bill to rename the Steele Creek Post Office after famed Charlotte civil rights attorney Julius L. Chambers. https://t.co/BmNFSOBOZgDo you need assistance with a federal agency? Visit my staff during mobile office hours this month! https://t.co/t11dNMECwMThis week, @HouseAgNews will mark up the #FarmBill.

One night of airstrikes does not constitute a thoughtful plan that keeps our military safe, protects innocent civilian lives, or holds Putin accountable for his role in enabling Assad. #SyriaStrikeTonight’s attack was carried out without a long term military plan. President Trump must present Congress with a comprehensive and clear plan of action and secure an Authorization for Use of Military Force before any further attacks are carried out.The latest chemical weapons attack against the Syrian people is a brutal war crime that demands a strong and strategic response. #SyriaStrikeApril 14 will mark 1460 days since #BokoHaram abducted 276 schoolgirls. 112 are still missing. #BBOGI'm proud to spotlight Andrew Larocca of Audrey Kell High School in Charlotte! He has been nominated to @NavalAcademy &amp; @AFAnews! https://t.co/KSTSjeJO6VI went to the House floor to implore my colleagues to protect #SNAP benefits for those in need. Yesterday, my R colleagues released their partisan #farmbill proposal that does exactly the opposite. I will not support it.

This week is just the beginning of an ongoing conversation with all legislators. #BMHW18 https://t.co/cKFXZUbWsUFor Black and Latina women in NC, the yearly pay gap is even wider with a yearly pay difference of $18,000 &amp; $25,000 respectively.  We must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so that all families and the economy are better off. #EqualPayDay2018NC women still only make an average of 82 cents on the $1 their male counterparts make, a yearly pay difference of more than $8,000 per woman. #EqualPayDay2018

It's time we take ownership of this issue and develop best practices to diversify our workforce as we move forward.If our policymakers aren't a reflection of the diverse nation we serve, we cannot expect that the policies they produce will address the challenges faced by our diverse citizenry.As we continue to challenge the private sector to increase diversity, we must take a hard look at our own diversity and inclusion practices to ensure our workforce and senior leadership reflects the American people who we serve.Accountability begins with government and the latest @USOPM report makes clear that we must step it up. https://t.co/RXkJdN4PUFApplications are still being accepted!
