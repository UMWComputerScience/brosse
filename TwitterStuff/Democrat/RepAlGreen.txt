Gun violence cases all have one thing in common: a gun. Thoughts &amp; prayers are not enough. Congress must act now. #MarylandShootingAny assault on any #Journalist is an assault on the freedom of the press. A free people must have a free press. #MarylandShootingThe raid of #Stonewall Inn 49 years ago today sparked a 6-day riot that ignited the US LGBTQ Rights Movement. To commemorate the rioters' legacy &amp; honor the trail they blazed, 94 of my colleagues &amp; I sponsored a bill to celebrate June as #PrideMonth.Where was the outrage from Republicans when the President was advocating  police brutality and complimenting the bigots in Charlottesville? #StandWithMaxine
https://t.co/T7zTcG3QCTToday America mourns the continual loss of humanity &amp; equality since @realDonaldTrump took office. The Trump v. Hawaii ruling legitimizes the attack on religious freedom &amp; the 1st Amendment by the Trump Administration. History will judge this decision. #WeWillNotBeBannedToday I celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community as an ally &amp; strong supporter of liberty and justice for all. #PRIDEHOUSTON https://t.co/XUrh50ss5nMr. President, you terrorized children with the family separation policy knowing the solution was in your hands. You demonize migrant families &amp; pretend to be their savior with a stroke of your pen. This is what xenophobia looks like. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead https://t.co/Vrjs2bCtO2Mr. Otting, discrimination &amp; economic disparity exist regardless of whether you've observed them during your 30 years in banking or not. The habitual &amp; blatant refusal to acknowledge the facts of discrimination in lending merely perpetuate this systemic racism. #OCCnoColorSeveral Members of Congress &amp; I marched with @RepGutierrez to Customs &amp; Border Patrol HQ to protest the separation of children from their families at the border. We must speak truth to power &amp; denounce the wrongs of this administration at all costs. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/2t6reriyeBThis administration‚Äôs cruel immigration policies have been tearing families apart for too long. The barbaric practice of separating parents from children for simply seeking refuge must end because a great nation doesn‚Äôt divide; it unifies. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMr. President, geopolitically speaking, those who sacrifice their tried &amp; true friends for untried, new friends may end up with no friends at all. #TrumpKimSummit https://t.co/Jv6XXQ9QhWWe march to honor the millions of women veterans in America. We march to show how far women have come as the fastest growing group among veterans. We march to show how far we have to go as women veterans face unique challenges after serving America w/pride. #WomensVeteransMarch https://t.co/nko1ifpWeOMr. President, a pardon won‚Äôt bring back the countless minorities who make up 62% of unarmed persons killed by police. It won‚Äôt bring back Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Danny Thomas, &amp; others. It won‚Äôt negate your comments that have incited harmful arrest practices among officers. https://t.co/iJ3Rwo2RLDMr. President, we have a duty &amp; an obligation to protest injustice when we see it. Peaceful protest is a right of all Americans. I salute @Kaepernick7 for his courage to peacefully protest the injustices against unarmed persons killed by police. https://t.co/WuvmyHbJRpToday, several witnesses before the House Financial Services Committee blatantly denied the existence of invidious discrimination in lending in this country although evidence consistently supports it &amp; testing has revealed it. https://t.co/yzA4EHHl3hMr. President, you've shown us that you believe you have absolute power. America is not a monarchy. I introduced HJRes 115 in 2017 to deny you the power to self-pardon. Ben Franklin was right. "We have a republic if we can keep it." #ImpeachmentIsNotDead https://t.co/aqjeYBtnngToday we #WearOrange to bring awareness to the 96 Americans who die everyday due to gun violence and the hundreds who are left injured. We #WearOrange for victims at home, school, work, the movies, the park, &amp; anywhere we are not shielded from gun violence. üíõ‚úäüèæüíõWith record numbers of white nationalists running for office, America cannot allow bigotry to further invade Capitol Hill. Enough is enough. We have to destroy the belief that bigots holding political office is acceptable &amp; it starts with the President. #ImpeachmentIsNotDeadTo whom it may concern, your efforts to suppress the legitimate impeachment of an unfit president are impacting the Democratic base. #ImpeachmentIsNotDeadIf bigotry is justifiable grounds for firing #RoseanneBarr, then surely the same should apply to the President. We have reached a point where many will dare to call Trump's actions bigoted, but dare not call him a bigot &amp; hold him accountable. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead.@TomSteyer &amp; I are fighting the good fight. We, along with millions of others, are committed to the impeachment of a person who is unfit to be President.  #ImpeachmentIsNotDeadMr. President, take the time now to take heed to what I previously indicated to you in my March 10th tweet. You still have the opportunity to create a meaningful summit, not a meaningless photo op. #NorthKoreaSummit https://t.co/YYhW2DmrQY.@SpeakerRyan bring the gun safety bills we have pending to the floor of the House for a vote. The American people need solutions, not just moments of silence for another group of victims. If you won't act, step aside. https://t.co/rMQXaqeY5y #ActionNotTalk #SantaFe #ParklandTalking tough is not enough, it's time to walk tough talk to the floor of Congress and vote. #SantaFeHighSchool #ActionNotTalkOne year and one day after I called for impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives, my position is still the same. As long as President Trump occupies the White House, #ImpeachmentIsNotDead.Although the President has the might to impose his bigotry into our policies, his might won't make his wrongs right, it will only prolong his wrongs. The solution is impeachment. #ImpeachmentisNotDead
https://t.co/GZ6nzOjuIAToday marks the first day of Islam's holiest month. Ramadan Mubarak to all who celebrate. I wish you well as you begin this time of consecration and fasting.Mr. President, as the First Lady makes her recovery, she, you, and the rest of your family are in my prayers.

Best of luck against the Golden State Warriors! #runasoneIn October, I challenged @SecretaryCarson to identify funding cuts to affordable housing. Today I still advocate for #NoCuts as I stand w/ #OurHomesOurVoices in the fight to increase access to affordable housing for the 3 in 4 individuals who need but don‚Äôt receive it. https://t.co/0RsgKV1MEGLes deseo un Feliz Cinco de Mayo departe de su Congresista Al Green del noveno districto congresional de Texas. https://t.co/zAAk5Ywr87Mr. President, you have continuously spewed contradictions. You have a strategy of offering a smorgasbord of lies for your supporters so they can choose the charade they believe justifies your perfidy. It's not about truth. It's about Trump. #ImpeachmentIsNotDeadMr. President, the Constitution does not allow you to fire the person investigating you. Permitting such would allow any guilty president to avoid impeachment by preventing an investigation. #RepealandReplaceTrumpMr. President, your refusal to be interviewed by the special counsel concerning his investigation will NOT exonerate you. Your firing Mr. Comey to thwart being investigated was, is, &amp; ever shall be an impeachable offense. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead#InternationalWorkersDay celebrates workplace rights like the 8 hr workday, paid vacation, &amp; sick leave. It also reminds us of the harsh realities of unfair wages &amp; unsafe working conditions that too many still endure. We must continue to fight for ALL working people.Mr. President, if you interfere with the Mueller investigation in contravention of the Constitution, I will file articles of impeachment. #ImpeachmeantIsNotDead #RepealandReplaceTrumpToday, Texas Medical Center announced groundbreaking plans for #TMC3. I look forward to seeing these visionary and innovative strides fulfilled, further establishing Houston as the Third Coast for life sciences and biomedical research. https://t.co/HNPXfLNovxI extend my sincerest condolences to the Bush family as we mourn the loss of #BarbaraBush. Although known for her virtue, poise, &amp; grace, it is First Lady Bush‚Äôs legacy of respectability that will be forever etched in the hearts &amp; minds of many Americans. https://t.co/pHcHdYNN68Today @AnthonyCGraves shared his powerful story of how the justice system failed him, his family, &amp; his community. He served 18.5 years in prison, 12 years on death row for a crime his accuser committed. His story is appalling, but not unique. We need #criminaljusticereform now! https://t.co/z6ZdytqfXpBy any name, the results remain the same. Supply side economics by @realDonaldTrump is a tax scheme for the rich and broken promises for the rest. #GOPTaxScam #TaxDay https://t.co/Rocgu5iF81On this important historical and spiritual day, I want to extend the hand of friendship to our Sikh brothers and sisters by wishing everyone a happy #Vaisakhi.Today, I opened our FSC oversight hearing with the issues that should have our focus. The concerns of consumer advocates about changes at the CFPB. Wells Fargo. Fair Lending. Invidious discrimination. These are the issues that matter.
https://t.co/19sV50dZyDDr. King‚Äôs untimely demise moved our nation to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which included the Fair Housing Act. That is why I am introducing H. Res 817 today to honor the brave Americans who sacrificed their lives for the right to affordable housing. #FHAct50We cannot stand idly by as our reckless President chooses to wage war in our name, without the consent of Congress, as well as fire Mr. Mueller. The President has a duty to respect that Constitutional process or face impeachment.  https://t.co/rO7keBixeNI neither support nor approve declarations of war via Twitter. The President should bring questions of war before the Congress. #AUMF #RepealandReplaceTrumpThe FBI raid of Michael Cohen's office and home already has Trump fuming. True to form, the Deflector-in-Chief is searching for someone to blame before we even know what was found. It seems that everyone is on the chopping block but the one responsible. #RepealandReplaceTrumpElected officials &amp; I met w/ the Homeland Security Committee to focus on improving Army Corps flood control projects &amp; future emergency response. I fought for $311M in funding for these projects. Our legacy of restoration will be greater than the storm's damage. #HoustonStrong https://t.co/9g17Tw9rziYesterday I attended #TristianHutchins funeral, the 8-year-old victim of a senseless drive-by shooting in Houston. No flags were flown at half-staff. Most of the mourners were children. A family in despair. The community in grief. We must not allow this to become the new normal.I will introduce The Reentry and Reunification Act of 2018 in Congress to help reunite families of American citizens with their deported loved ones. Families like the Escobars deserve better than the unjust deportation policies of this administration. https://t.co/WhT2NAU0OlPlease join me at 11am CST for a LIVE press conference as I discuss plans to introduce legislation to reunite families with deported individuals. https://t.co/hIESFdghCx50 years ago the monumental and fearless drum major for justice was assassinated. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. courageously led the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s. We must commemorate his legacy and continue to fight for justice and equality for all. #MLK50Once again ‚ÄúThe Great Dealmaker‚Äù has become the Great Deal Breaker, abandoning his promises to America and #Dreamers. We need a bipartisan negotiation not a unilateral dictation to act in the best interest of this country. Agreements are negotiated not dictated, Mr. President.Our hearts ache as we mourn the loss of #WinnieMandela. For decades she was a symbol of resistance to systems of political oppression in South Africa &amp; across the world. Her legacy of good deeds will live long after her transition. I offer my sincerest condolences to the MandelasTo all who commemorate the crucifixion and celebrate the resurrection, Happy Easter! #EasterSunday #ResurrectionSundayAdding a citizenship question to the #2020Census will discourage participation &amp; promote fear in immigrant communities. An unfair &amp; inaccurate count will result in the loss of critical fed funding for services that local governments will have to step up &amp; fund due to fed mandatesToday we must support youth who are marching for their lives. We cannot allow this to be just a moment in time. It must be  a seminal movement of our time. #Rememberthe17 #MarchforOurLivesLawyer resigns. National Security Adviser fired. Porn star sued. Dow down 700+ points. How does this make America great again, Mr. President?Thank you to local and national law enforcement officers who collaborated to protect the people of #Austin.  However, we must stay vigilant until the investigation is over. #TexasStrongOur hearts &amp; minds are with the victims and affected family members of the bombings in #Austin. It is my hope that the culprit is apprehended before being able to strike again. NO ONE should have to live with this fear. #ATXFake memos. Too many Dems. Comey lying. Witch hunt. These are among the many excuses @realDonaldTrump has used to end the Mueller investigation. If there is no collusion &amp; you have nothing to hide Mr. President, why not let the lawful Republican-led investigation continue?I am devastated to hear about the loss of @LouiseSlaughter. She was an inspiring force for change, full of strength, courage, and conviction. My prayers are with her family, staff, and the residents of her community as they navigate these struggling times.Congrats to my alma mater  @TSUMensHoops for advancing as the 16th seed with their first ever @marchmadness tournament win!

We have been the home of too many mass shootings and survivors are tired of thoughts and prayers. Gun violence is becoming America‚Äôs shame. The world is watching. https://t.co/iGsR9vkQSi#Rexit is here - Sec. Tillerson is out. Pres. Trump continues to make impulsive decisions regarding American diplomacy, risking our credibility. We need stability &amp; consistency now more than ever - especially if he wants a successful &amp; meaningful negotiation with Kim Jong-un.President Putin, blaming others won't absolve you from Russian hacking. #TrumpRussiaI send my condolences to the victims and loved ones of those affected by the bombings in Austin. If you receive any suspicious or unexpected packages, please do not open them and call 911. Let us pray that the police quickly catch the person responsible.Today I join the city of Houston as we mourn the loss and celebrate the life of Councilman Larry Green. Councilman Green was an ally, fraternity brother, and dear friend. His knowledge of policy and passion for people will be sorely missed. RIP #LarryGreenMr. President, a summit should be a sensible, thoughtful action, not a visceral, thoughtless reaction. Diplomats must set the summit table with substance before presidents sit to dine, otherwise it reduces the opportunity to a photo op. #NorthKoreaTalksIf President Trump meets w/ President Kim Jong Un as a visceral reaction to a calculated invitation at least 2 things will occur, 1) Kim Jong Un will gain legitimacy on the world stage, &amp; 2) N. Korea will gain legitimacy as a nuclear state. A good deal for Kim, a raw deal for us.On this #InternationalWomensDay I am inspired by all the incredible women who stand up every day for justice, equality, and empowerment. https://t.co/7w1rfbT3dlIt comes as no surprise that Sec. Carson is removing key anti-discrimination language from HUD‚Äôs mission statement as we approach the 50th Anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. @SecretaryCarson must explain why this will not undermine and chip away at our fundamental civil rights..@realDonaldTrump I stand with Dreamers in defense of their parents who brought them here. Dreamers should not be required to sacrifice their parents to acquire a pathway to citizenship.  https://t.co/IQQkKtObxbIt's #ElectionDay, Texas! Make sure you get out and vote - polls are open from 7 am - 7 pm. https://t.co/lLRSnhffhlPresident Trump promised to protect #Dreamers - instead, he decided to end #DACA and has rejected all bipartisan proposals. Thankfully, the Supreme Court ruling has delayed the March 5 deadline. Shame on you @realDonaldTrump! #DreamActNow #HereToFight https://t.co/gKLsvw2ZUD$0. That is how much money the State Department has spent, out of $120 million available, to investigate and prevent election meddling. If the President wants to demonstrate that he is free from involvement with Russia, he should call for the money to be spent to prevent meddlinghttps://t.co/KsSWag2apU.@realDonaldTrump continues to say one thing in public and another behind closed doors. We just saw it with DACA and now we are seeing it with guns. Who‚Äôs really afraid of the NRA here, Mr. President?#Holi is an exciting celebration of life, culture, diversity, and color. May you enjoy a bright and joyous spring. Happy Holi!We must oppose invidious discrimination against African Americans in the financial sector. If this is called playing the ‚Äòrace card,‚Äô I will play the race card, because clearly the status quo works for some, but not all, Americans. https://t.co/immoK23qmdToday the Supreme Court is hearing arguments on #JanusvAFSCME. We must ensure the rights of workers to organize while balancing the needs of employers. When working people are unionized, the rights of workers are best protected. #UnionProudToday is the Working People's Day of Action. I will always stand with our unions in the continued fight against those that seek to weaken working class families. Unions are a cornerstone of the American economy and we cannot afford to leave them behind. https://t.co/Rp2J1LuCbFIt is always a pleasure to join the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo for the Downtown Rodeo Parade.

Does each new indictment bring Mueller one step closer to the Oval Office?During WWII, over 120,000 citizens or residents of Japanese ancestry were arrested and put into internment camps. Today, we observe a Day of Remembrance for Japanese Internment so that we may never repeat this atrocious mistake again.Conservatives only want to conserve when Democrats are in power, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt have borrowed $1.5 trillion for tax cuts and endorsed a President that plans to add $7 trillion to the deficit. #GOPTaxScamIn the past 46 days the United States has already had 18 school shootings. When are we going to say enough is enough? We can all send thoughts and prayers, but we also need to be willing to take action now. #ParklandSchoolShooting@JoeNBC, I will always defend your right to freedom of speech even when it‚Äôs against me and I hope you will defend my right to express my deep concern for the soul of our nation in the face of impeachable bigoted actions emanating from the presidency.

We are here to remind our veteran patients that they have not been forgotten and that I will continue to fight for them in Congress. https://t.co/FYZfrjAYZYPlease read the AP story on my trip to El Salvador to continue our efforts to bring my constituent, Jose Escobar, home. Mr. Escobar is STILL my constituent &amp; what the Trump Administration has done to separate him from his American wife &amp; two American children is unacceptable. https://t.co/5iwyzI91ArThe #NunesMemo amounts to little more than a document that will mislead the public. Having read both memos, I am concerned that this memo is being used to justify unreasonable attacks on the Mueller investigation and those who serve in our law enforcement &amp; intelligence agencies..@realDonaldTrump says he stands with Harvey victims, he loves us and we will pull through together, however, he has not delivered the money needed for us to recover. Love will not rebuild the roof or repair flood damage. #SOTUI extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of the sanitation worker who lost their life in the #Amtrak accident and send comforting prayers for the safety and well-being of everyone involved in the incident.‚ÄúWe are devolving into the hijacking of justice itself...there is a devolution taking place, and there is a solution: the impeachment of an unfit president.‚Äù #RepealandReplaceTrump https://t.co/Mxu5ym99eRDay 3 of #TrumpShutdown.

Rather than negotiate and compromise, the President has sacrificed funding our government to fund tax breaks for the very rich. https://t.co/jq9QN9xV4TThe GOP refused to work with Democrats on a bipartisan budget deal. They are now holding the government hostage, jeopardizing the health of millions of children and the future of Dreamers. #TrumpShutdown.@realDonaldTrump When you break more deals than you make, you are not a great dealmaker you are a great deal breaker. https://t.co/v0nnjtw6tKThis is not what American democracy looks like!
