Having a great time with the women of @akasorority1908 Delta Kappa Omega Chapter at their annual Gentlemen's Sampler. There are more than 70 chefs here.

Join us on Friday, July 20 at 10 a.m. https://t.co/6Det8S8jDMThe residents of the Apalachicola Bay have long suffered from reduced water flow, which has caused serious harm to the region‚Äôs oyster industry &amp; ecology. This is a major win for the state of #Florida. https://t.co/2reEYWQtMLIt is because of #NetNeutrality that entrepreneurs are able to start and grow their businesses online. We need to #SaveNetNeutrality and prevent Internet Service Providers from pricing these businesses out of the online marketplace. I signed the Net Neutrality discharge petition. https://t.co/cH8b9eE4WJToday, is the fifth anniversary of Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act. Voting is a right, not a privilege. Our democracy only works when elections are free &amp; fair, and all eligible voters are able to cast a ballot #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/NmC1eF4TQKMany of migrant girls came to the U.S. to flee the violence back home. Tearing them away from their families exacerbates their trauma. When asked where the girls and toddlers are being held, @SecNielsen didn‚Äôt know. #WhereAreTheGirls? #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/v7v6PAOzvEI support @RepJerryNadler's #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct because we need to do everything possible to stop the practice of family separation. Families belong together and the #Trump Administration‚Äôs degradation of the parent-child relationship is cruel and inhumane. https://t.co/eH89bWXxnfThere needs to be a strong message sent that the U.S - a country whose story has been written by those fleeing oppression ‚Äì will not abandon the world‚Äôs most vulnerable.  We must reaffirm our leadership in promoting the safety of refugees.#RefugeesWelcome #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/IPscPmF0dZ@ManicMiamiMom I agree. That is why I have co-sponsored H.Res.927, Condemning the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy and the Keep Families Together Act.@ManicMiamiMom I completely agree. It is horrible what the Trump Administration is doing. This ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù immigration policy is just the latest assault from his extreme anti-immigrant agenda. This shouldn't be about politics, but about human decency.‚ÄùBy June 19, 1865, all slaves received notice they were indeed free. Slavery is part of our nation's history. It is written in history books &amp; told through family narratives. As we celebrate #Juneteenth2018, we must learn from our past if we truly hope to move our country forward. https://t.co/3XsY0Qq6SSThe practice of separating children from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane. Seeking asylum is not illegal. In fact, it is written into US immigration laws to ensure that those w/a credible fear of persecution can present their case #FamiliesBelongTogetherThis ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù immigration policy is the latest assault from Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. Despite what he wants the American public to believe, there is no law that requires family separation. This isn‚Äôt about politics. It‚Äôs about human decency. #FamiliesBelongTogetherI reject Trump‚Äôs heartless decision to bar asylum to the most vulnerable victims of domestic and gang violence. I believe that seeking refuge is a human right that we must uphold.Happy 243rd Birthday of the U.S. #Army! https://t.co/doNbsOyusFIt was my honor to present the Service to Community Award to #Tallahassee's @WCTV  and @JulieMontanaroW at the Celebration of Service to America awards.

Tell @orlandosentinel publisher Avido, a great @FAMU_1887 grad, I said hi üëãüèæA #TrumpShutdown means that popular 7(a) and 504 loans would cease to be issued. In the 7(a) program alone, a shutdown would reduce capital to small firms by $110 million per day.A #TrumpShutdown prevents federal agencies from entering into any new contracts, including those with small businesses. On a daily basis, a shutdown could cause small firms to forgo approximately 6,875 contract actions worth $301,656,083.The LAST thing our country needs is a government shutdown. This #TrumpShutdown won‚Äôt help the economy, it won‚Äôt help our kids stay healthy, and it won‚Äôt help anyone in my district. Frankly, it‚Äôs ridiculous that Republicans have brought us to this point. GOP, #DoYourJob!The priorities Americans want to see addressed (pensions, DREAMers, health care for kids, etc) aren‚Äôt controversial. So why is the GOP marching towards a #TrumpShutdown?We need to solve problems, reach compromise and provide dependable funding for our military and domestic agencies, and fund disaster relief.  I implore my GOP colleagues to work throughout the weekend to keep the federal government open. #GOPshutdownI strongly oppose today's anti-choice bill that plays politics with  deeply personal health care decisions.
