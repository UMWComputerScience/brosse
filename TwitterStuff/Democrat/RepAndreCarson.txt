My heart is with the @capgaznews staff and community of #Annapolis after today’s horrifying and senseless act of gun violence. It’s long past time for Congress to come together and act to help #EndGunViolenceICYMI: Busy day in @Transport yesterday! My Federal Protective Service Reforms were included and passed in H.R. 6194, &amp; we also approved $45M for repairs &amp; safety upgrades to the Bean Federal Center in Indy.  -&gt; https://t.co/XHW0s6e5M9I stand w/labor because labor stands w/working people all across the nation and world! #Janus #UnionStrong https://t.co/Rjaf2nC1pLToday’s decision will be remembered as a shameful sanctioning of discrimination, and one that history will judge harshly. -&gt; https://t.co/8imUG8YuCB https://t.co/2jkPRxURgnDiscrimination is not a national security strategy, and prejudice is not patriotism. Trump’s xenophobic travel ban is an outright attack on the Muslim community that violates our nation’s commitment to liberty and justice for all.  #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/yCGdlpdIttThis decision is about presidential authority, NOT an affirmation of the President’s bigoted policy or history of targeting immigrants. His policy continues to hurt countless families across our country. Congress must vote to strike down this affront to our values as Americans. https://t.co/9u8mVnxXGmThanks to everyone who came out to today’s Northwest Neighborhood Planning Meeting! https://t.co/LwufZA8tTvIndiana welcomed 96 new U.S. citizens from 35 countries during this morning's naturalization ceremony. #WelcomeHoosiers https://t.co/hzcrTAQ6A3Disappointing update today in #rail subcommittee hearing on pipeline safety from #Trump Administration. Congressional changes we passed years ago to save lives are still overdue.Today, on #WorldRefugeeDay I call on @realDonaldTrump &amp; the #TrumpAdministration to end their cruel policy of separating families. No one chooses to become a refugee. We must continue to promote the safety &amp; well-being of vulnerable refugees as they seek a better life. https://t.co/Zfudbpkt9fPromoting human rights has been an American priority for decades. By withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council we lose an opportunity to drive change through dialogue. It’s tragic to allow violations and bias to go unaddressed through our absence.Children should not be ripped from the arms of their parents. Babies need to stay with their loving parents. I support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct which would stop the #Trump Administration's government sanctioned child abuse policy. https://t.co/qHqLMjaxwZAre you as outraged by the heartless separation of children from their parents as I am? This is a choice being made by the #TrumpAdministration, not the law. Your voice matters.

We cannot  forget that they died to protect us.

As a reminder, it raises taxes on 86 million middle-class households while cutting taxes for the wealthy. https://t.co/6tIyPaTlmK'Our country is in dire need of a modern tax code. But more than that, we need a tax code that supports those who work hard every day &amp; still struggle to get by. This bill does the opposite, which is why I voted against it in the House.' My statement-&gt;https://t.co/6IbtnZIDiyOn my way to the House Floor to vote NO on the #taxbill. This bill is a failed opportunity to grow our economy, boost small businesses &amp; help middle class Hoosiers get ahead.You work hard for your paycheck. And of course you hate paying taxes. But it’s even worse watching your hard earned dollars pay for a massive tax break for millionaires &amp; billionaires. Let’s reform our tax code to help working families succeed. Not to make the rich richer.Thousands of Hoosiers signed up for health insurance for the first time under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans are tossing aside affordable coverage to pay for their $1.5 trillion tax cut. The #goptaxscam will make Americans less healthy.What is more shocking than Republicans adding $1.5 trillion to the debt, for our children &amp; grandchildren to pay for? Their hints that they might pay for it by cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid. The #goptaxscam will hurt Americans for years to come.Something is wrong when 80% of Hoosiers only get 31% of the tax breaks. No individual should be seeing a tax cut larger than an entire working neighborhood. Hoosiers deserve better. Oppose the #goptaxscam https://t.co/IatqU1Z3EXHonored to deliver the commencement address to the graduating class @uindy this morning.
