3 years ago we celebrated the landmark SCOTUS ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states. With this ruling our nation took a giant step forward to make good on the words of our pledge of allegiance ‘with liberty&amp;justice for all.’ #EqualityForwardWith my colleagues on our way to tour the Port Isabel ICE Detention Center https://t.co/GTw27bHWzSI am here in McAllen, Texas. Currently being briefed by Border Patrol on the President’s zero tolerance policy. https://t.co/farpVM7uFFYou can read more about the letter here: https://t.co/TWk5vso2EL https://t.co/bvvoqrb4l4NEW: I'm asking @HHSGov for more information regarding the children placed in the care of HHS as a result of the Trump's immoral zero-tolerance policy. I want to know if any of the children have been transported and are currently being housed in the 18th Congressional District. https://t.co/5dh469t9tYHeads up: I will be joining @KatyTurNBC on @hardball at 7:15 p.m. EST to discuss the President’s inhumane family separation policy.I hope that my visit to the detention center in Texas will bring some solace to the children and families who are being held because of the President’s policy that is not supported by the majority of the American people.

https://t.co/7sI0q57hSd https://t.co/WcuNAdzxOOThe Executive Order signed by the President to detain families indefinitely instead of separating them does nothing to end the blanket criminal prosecution of asylum seekers.Joining my colleagues now to introduce the #KeepFamilesTogetherAct that will end the President’s inhumane policy of ripping children apart from their parents. https://t.co/oBk8ABaOwaAs the daughter of immigrants who fled persecution abroad, I’m deeply offended by the Administration’s shameful effort to rob hope from the hopeless, and I will continue to do everything I can to stop the inhumane separation of families. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/J2L8d4aDycOur immigration laws provide a special status to refugees because they are fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries. The Administration’s policy of separating them from their families is a cruel and misguided effort to dissuade them from seeking asylum in the U.S.May this joyous day for the Muslim community encourage us all to reflect on the important values it represents: compassion, tolerance, reconciliation and charity. https://t.co/2zJbTB1JnOI wish Muslims in my District and around the world Eid Mubarak as they gather to celebrate Eid al-Fitr and the completion of the holy month of Ramadan. https://t.co/MsX7pk7jwMIn yet another example of the Administration’s sabotage of the ACA, I will continue fighting to ensure that those who have pre-existing health conditions will not be denied coverage because of their medical history.Eviscerating the protections the ACA put in place will make it all but impossible for millions of Americans who have pre-existing conditions to be able to buy any health insurance whatsoever.Last week the Administration announced their refusal to defend the ACA's protections in court for more than 130 million Americans, including 325,000 of my constituents who live with pre-existing conditions.I’ve signed the Discharge Petition to have the #DreamAct automatically come to the Floor of the House for a vote. 218 signatures are required and as of today, 215 members have signed it. Only 3 more to go. 

https://t.co/2SMNdZ3z9fToday is the day when the current #NetNeutrality protections will cease to exist. I spoke on the floor of the House last week about the importance of a free and open Internet. https://t.co/gXIo5JNpQxThat's why this lawsuit, the largest congressional lawsuit ever to be brought against a sitting President, is critically important. If the President won’t abide by the Constitution, the courts must require him to do so. #NoOneAboveTheLawThe full extent of the benefits that Trump is receiving from foreign governments is unknown b/c he has refused to make his tax returns public &amp; failed to comply with what is specifically outlined in the Constitution: come to Congress &amp; seek its consent before accepting benefits.Foreign governments have also granted Trump businesses lucrative trademarks that could be worth millions of dollars. #NoOneAboveTheLaw@realDonaldTrump Public reporting makes it clear that the President has already violated the Emoluments Clause. Foreign governments have leased space at Trump properties and have paid for rooms and events at Trump’s D.C. hotel.

https://t.co/ovuKJwRdDN@realDonaldTrump didn't place his assets in a true blind trust when he took office &amp; instead turned his businesses over to his children, so he retained a financial stake in his businesses. This raises the specter of him receiving foreign payments w/o the consent of Congress.What is the Emoluments Clause? Article 1 of the Constitution states that any officer of the United States is prohibited from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments or agents without the approval of Congress. #NoOneAboveTheLawTHREAD:

I’ve joined 195 House and Senate colleagues in filing a lawsuit against President Trump for violating the #EmolumentsClause of the Constitution. The District Court for DC will hear the oral arguments in our case today. #NoOneAboveTheLawYou can read more about the letter here: https://t.co/6pX1ih0eht https://t.co/Asv0ibtMJlToday I urged Commerce Sec. Wilbur Ross to rescind the decision to entertain any U.S. relationship with ZTE.

I applaud the lawmakers in my home state for working to restore #NetNeutrality.@AjitPaiFCC's decision to destroy the free and open Internet has left Americans across the country vulnerable to having their Internet experience controlled and manipulated by the largest ISPs, making it necessary for states to intervene &amp; provide a platform for free expression.Californians were handed a major victory when the State Senate passed strong legislation to save #NetNeutrality https://t.co/lJmGg7bPQJI joined House colleagues in writing to the Secretary of Health and Human Services voicing our strong opposition to defunding these essential healthcare services for women that my constituents rely on. #ProtectTitleX https://t.co/XhKiL3DR2FThe President’s decision to cut this funding will lead to more unintended pregnancies and higher cancer mortality rates across our country. This is an unwarranted attack on women’s health. #ProtectTitleXPlanned Parenthood uses Title X funding to provide family planning services, mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, and other critically important healthcare services for women. Not one cent is used to fund abortions. #ProtectTitleXThe free and open Internet drives jobs, the free market, and our democracy.

The fight now moves to the House. I signed a Discharge Petition today to force a vote to fully restore #NetNeutrality https://t.co/LapikBSrqyThe breaking news this morning is more than heartbreaking, this time at Santa Fe High School. We grieve with the families who have lost their loved ones due to yet another tragedy of gun violence. https://t.co/gvJIAeHLdcThis is heartless and wrong. I strongly oppose the House GOP’s Farm Bill because no one should be hungry in our country. We are a better people and a better nation, and our national policies should reflect these values. #ProtectSNAPThe GOP’s #FarmBill cuts SNAP benefits by $23 billion and requires SNAP recipients to work to receive food, even if they care for young children or are nearing retirement age. These changes will deny food assistance to more than 1 million hungry Americans over the next decade.This is a misguided and dangerous decision, exhibiting an unwillingness to take cybersecurity seriously.The DNI recently identified cyberattacks as the top threat to U.S. national security, yet the White House eliminated the position of Cybersecurity Coordinator, the only official responsible for organizing cybersecurity efforts across the government.

A free and open Internet is essential to improving the quality of life for all Americans and it must be protected.The new FCC Chairman fulfilled his vow to eliminate the 2015 Open Internet Order which enshrined #NetNeutrality protections into law, but it’s clear that his idea has been rejected in the court of public opinion with millions of Americans weighing in to support #NetNeutrality.Since his first day in office @realDonaldTrump has worked to sabotage the ACA by repealing the individual mandate, allowing junk insurance policies that cost more &amp; provide less coverage, &amp; cutting funding for outreach during the open enrollment period.

My statement here- https://t.co/rjoLNmShE7Tax Bill Lets Trump and Republicans Feather Their Own Nests https://t.co/3K5qpOc3SbFCC Chairman @AjitPaiFCC fulfilled his promise today to destroy the free and open Internet, but tomorrow the battle commences. https://t.co/nf2WFifbjt#NetNeutrality protections have advanced competition &amp; innovation, created more startups &amp; entrepreneurs, like the ones I met with in my Congressional District in June. Repealing these protections is an assault on what has made the internet what it is… an open &amp; dynamic platform https://t.co/iL5vUcdIvJOverturning #NetNeutrality rules means that big companies could choose what websites and applications we see online, not us. The largest ISPs will have the power to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.The current #NetNeutrality rules are simple: They prevent your broadband provider from blocking or throttling lawful content online. https://t.co/x1drPIvjnoThis move by @AjitPaiFCC brings no #NetNeutrality rules with it. None. It bucks 22 years of consensus under Republican and Democratic FCC chairmen that Americans have a right to access all legal content and the FCC has a duty to enforce that right.

https://t.co/JWWs2sFg2SEven as millions of Americans have voiced their support for a free and open internet, @AjitPaiFCC is determined to unravel all #NetNeutrality protections TOMORROW.Republicans say that the #GOPTaxScam will pay for itself, but @jctgov found that both the House and Senate tax bills will minimally add $1 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. https://t.co/gb410RDYwcOverturning #NetNeutrality rules means that ISPs could choose what websites and applications we see online, not us. The largest ISPs will have the power to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content. https://t.co/095HpwgCxqIt was an honor to work with him, and my constituents will long be grateful for his major role in helping to secure full funding for the electrification of Caltrain.
My prayers are with Mayor Lee’s family and the people of San Francisco during this sad and difficult time.The sudden loss of San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has shocked and saddened us all. He was a policy thoroughbred and a dedicated public servant for San Franciscans and the entire Bay Area. https://t.co/3EDWtM0WziIf you hate your cable company, you're going to hate the repeal of #NetNeutrality even more.

Period. #NetNeutrality https://t.co/qmw1lWMKtGSenate Republicans have even added a provision in the #GOPTaxScam to unravel the Affordable Care Act, increasing the cost of Americans’ health premiums, and leading to 13 million Americans going uninsured.

https://t.co/bwqoe2UQveIn California alone, over 4 million working households making less than $109,160 will see their taxes increase. https://t.co/fEB8DUJ7hJRepublicans are continuing their assault this week on the middle class by racing forward with the #GOPTaxScam; a plan that will raise taxes on 82 million middle class families, &amp; charge $1.5 trillion to the national debt. It’s a plan that will do lasting damage to our country. https://t.co/9pjVRaERALI’m proud to stand with the millions of Americans who are opposed to @AjitPaiFCC's efforts to roll back #netneutrality protections. Eliminating these protections benefits the largest ISPs &amp; would be a significant loss for consumers.

https://t.co/lRnrBow4N3Editorial: Free flow of the Internet must be preserved https://t.co/StRnbdLBn2 via @sfchronicleToday @AjitPaiFCC confirmed his long-term goal to unravel #NetNeutrality, demonstrating that he is on the wrong side of history, startups, consumers and the public interest. https://t.co/M96HZpInITImportant thread on #NetNeutrality ⬇️ https://t.co/kV1SoC9VjBOn #WorldPancreaticCancerDay and every day I continue to push for federal investments in biomedical research until we find a cure #WageHope https://t.co/vvN8ECj1Z9The #GOPTaxScam is unfair, unbalanced, and fiscally irresponsible and it dims the future of our country by attacking the middle class.
