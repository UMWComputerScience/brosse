Congrats @SalemFD Chief Paul Parisi on being named State Fire Marshal! Thank you for meeting with me this morning to discuss how @fema SAFER grants have improved the department's response to emergencies in Salem. I will continue to support funding for these important grants. https://t.co/cAUfk59fGrMeeting w/ @chamber81main and local rotary club this AM to discuss my work and receive feedback on what more Congress can be doing to support Granite Staters on important issues like expanding our economy, improving veterans’ access to care and combating the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/nuii4tj7CYThis week I helped introduce the Family Unity Rights and Protection Act which would require the reunification of children separated from their parents at the border. Families seeking asylum should be treated humanely and their asylum claim processed swiftly. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/p1iEcvnHEDMy heart breaks for all those impacted by the tragic shooting at @capgaznews in Annapolis. It's long past time we work together in Congress to end this senseless violence.Former @mht_nh_police Chief Nick Willard has done a great job leading efforts in NH to confront the opioid crisis &amp; he will be an effective U.S. Marshal for our state. I’m pleased @Senjudiciary has endorsed him &amp; I urge full Senate to confirm him quickly. https://t.co/uTloc3ep1vFor too long military sexual assault survivors have been hindered from coming forward because of a policy that requires punishment for minor offenses. My amendment to the DoD spending bill funds a study of this issue. No survivor should be afraid to report https://t.co/PJ46IbNHUFThank you for your work to support youth impacted by the opioid epidemic. #OpioidsYoungVictims https://t.co/bUSuu55pPV https://t.co/HTvpzMA4pU#SCOTUS ruling today is affront to organized labor &amp; working people &amp; will undermine ongoing efforts to increase wages, enhance benefits &amp; make work environments safer. It's more important than ever to defend workers' rights &amp; ensure everyone can get ahead https://t.co/Zq0qvk7zKwIt’s critical for the future of veterans’ healthcare that the VA’s Electronic Health Record system be implemented in an orderly way &amp; that it is fully functional. I will work with my colleagues to encourage this transition and improve care for our veterans https://t.co/RLGcx7MvLrThe ruling that children &amp; their parents be reunited is an important step in the right direction but our job is not done. We must ensure the Administration is providing appropriate guidance to agencies so these families are actually brought back together.  https://t.co/xEhtkmje3ZThree years ago, #LGBTQ couples in all 50 states were granted the fundamental right to marry. We must build on this progress &amp; pass the Equality Act, which protects #LGBTQ Americans nationwide from being fired, evicted or denied services because of who they love. #EqualityForwardThe Bipartisan Heroin &amp; Opioid Task Force has shown that when people put their differences aside &amp; focus on results, real progress can be made. I’m proud of our work to improve our response to the opioid epidemic. Read more in my @ConMonitorNews op-ed: https://t.co/Na9mIJXdnASmall businesses and consumers in New Hampshire deserve access to a free and open internet. I’ve signed the #NetNeutrality discharge petition because it’s time for the House to vote to reverse the @FCC’s repeal of this critical policy. #SavetheInternet https://t.co/oPorJHqKWjBeing born a woman shouldn’t be a “pre-existing condition.” But if Republicans’ attacks on protections for millions of Americans are successful, we could see health care costs rise for women nationwide. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/7I3xPQ5aGcThe more people vote, the stronger our Democracy. We need to be increasing voter registration and participation, not suppressing the right to vote. It’s time for Congress to come together to #RestoretheVOTE and pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act. https://t.co/CIV4QrJqywVeterans deserve seamless access to services &amp; peace of mind in achieving academic goals. Glad my bill w/@RepGusBilirakis to prevent colleges from disrupting vets’ education because of VA errors was introduced in the Senate by @SenWarren &amp; @JohnBoozman. https://t.co/EuIGYhkpsQWe must treat families on the border in a more humanitarian way. During my trip to Texas I heard about the success of the Family Case Management Program and I believe that program and others can help prevent the terrible situation currently taking place. https://t.co/1CXH3vgILGI just toured an ICE detention center outside of Brownsville, TX. I was very disturbed to hear of women having their babies taken from them some while nursing. This is a completely unacceptable way of treating families seeking asylum. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/fmWpGvDgM3We’re leaving McAllen and heading to Brownsville, TX. Unfortunately, our time in McAllen provided more questions than answers about the separation of families. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/l9Yu5xAqniSpeaking on @CNN about what we've seen at detention centers in McAllen, TX. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/YQicpAlxTjHere’s more of what I’ve seen at the McAllen border centers. Officials are telling us they need more guidance on the President’s Executive Order on the separation of families. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/GkdlGZ96FoI just toured the McAllen Border Patrol Processing Center here’s what I saw. https://t.co/yVWduh1GkBI’m at the McAllen Border Patrol Station to tour the facility &amp; get answers about the reunification of families &amp; the impact of @POTUS’s Executive Action. This morning we were briefed by advocates and the stories we heard of kids being taken from their families were heartbreaking https://t.co/34WjnAqcN9-We’ve seen photos of detention centers holding boys, but #WhereAreTheGirls, toddlers and babies?
-What is the plan for reunification of the 2,300 children who have been separated from their parents?
-Is @realDonaldTrump executive order preventing families from being separated?Thank you to the more than 1000 Granite Staters who have contacted my office deeply concerned about the separation of families the border. I’m heading to McAllen, TX to bear witness to what is happening &amp; identify how we can protect families seeking asylum. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/u9EQCACM3bToday I wear purple to honor my late mother, State Senator Susan McLane, and all the individuals we've lost to Alzheimer's disease. I will continue working to expand research to find a cure so that no one has to suffer from this devastating disease. #TheLongestDay #EndAlz https://t.co/HjI5XPKuEy.@RepDebDingell &amp; I are demanding info on girls, toddlers &amp; infants held in detention on the southern border. This is a devastating crisis and the American government cannot be in the business of locking up children including toddlers and babies. https://t.co/bX93qNXogiHappy 230th Birthday New Hampshire! On this day in 1788, our great state ratified the constitution and became the 9th state in the union. So blessed to call this beautiful place home. https://t.co/7MxWs8uETO#SCOTUS’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair is devastating for small New Hampshire companies that sell products online. This misguided ruling will subject Granite State companies to thousands of taxing jurisdictions and will hurt NH small businesses. https://t.co/XJfb69fWrtNearly 2,300 children have been separated from their families. These kids must be reunited with their parents as soon as possible. I’m glad @FLOTUS is asking these questions but sadly the Administration has yet to announce a plan for reunification. https://t.co/Tx70A3KIrfThe values of compassion and acceptance are central to our identity as a nation. We should treat people who have come to our country to escape violence and trauma with kindness and support. #WorldRefugeeDayI'm pleased the @US_FDA is reevaluating its decision to require pure maple syrup &amp; honey to have an "added sugar" label. This flawed policy could have given consumers the impression that pure maple syrup and honey contain artificial sugar additives. 
https://t.co/OkBtkrvDJzTaking toddlers and infants from their mothers and fathers is simply appalling. These #tenderage facilities are alarming and wrong. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/7Fu0wm1EAjOn #Juneteenth we commemorate the end of slavery in 1865 &amp; honor those who were lost to this barbaric practice. We must build on progress we've made in our fight for racial equality &amp; continue working to create a fairer, more just &amp; more inclusive society. https://t.co/NbUu3voEHwFACT CHECK: “The Trump administration implemented this policy by choice and could end it by choice. No law or court ruling mandates family separations.” - @washingtonpost
   
@realDonaldTrump please end this heartless policy now! 

Read more here: https://t.co/fm7JKlJnN4Congratulations @CassandrasBill—your hard work to end child marriage in New Hampshire has paid off. Our state will no longer allow kids who aren’t old enough to drive to marry, giving them a chance at a better future.  You should be very proud. https://t.co/zW0xizb7AYThrilled the NH Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights legislation has been signed into law. This is a step in the right direction when it comes to supporting Granite Staters who have experienced these horrific crimes.Requiring maple producers to label syrup as containing “added sugar” is misleading &amp; potentially harmful to producers’ economic well-being. I’ve called on @US_FDA to abandon this misguided decision &amp; will continue working to support the NH maple industry https://t.co/ShTItxCENKWonderful to meet @CassandrasBill at the @NHWomensFndn GALA.

We all knew what the problem was,” Kraft said. “She didn’t have her mother, and none of us can fix that.”

This is heartbreaking and must end.

I'm pleased NH will receive $22.9 million in additional funding to bolster our response to the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/kPFjO6jukqThe opioid epidemic doesn’t discriminate &amp; is impacting communities nationwide. Our Bipartisan Heroin &amp; Opioid Task Force has helped educate Congress on this issue &amp; I’m encouraged House advanced dozens of bills that will help stem the tide of this crisis. https://t.co/E2ez6d1X5BImmediately separating children from their families at the border is unconscionable. These families flee violence &amp; danger &amp; should have the opportunity to apply for asylum. I’ve signed onto a bill to help end this practice. We can have law &amp; order without compromising our values https://t.co/ts7dfeIJ6cGreat to meet w/@Chessy_Prout, her co-author @jennabelson &amp; @RepMarkTakano to discuss Chessy's powerful memoir #IHaveTheRightTo.

I will continue to advocate for responsible gun laws while protecting the Second Amendment.  https://t.co/hGKXUjkowYThank you @Concord_HRC for building a new shelter in our state capital so that 40 more people will have a safe, warm place to sleep at night. No one should sleep on the street, and I will continue working to ensure every Granite Stater has a home. https://t.co/Iz9Us6HpZ3Happy 106th Birthday @GirlScouts! As a former Girl Scout, I am so thankful for all this organization does to empower girls and young women and inspire them to make a positive difference in the world. #GirlScoutDayThese women are breaking down barriers and making history as the first  enlisted female students at Camp Pendleton's Marine Combat Training course.

Make sure to give emergency vehicles and plows plenty of room. https://t.co/39HtRYyltRToo many veterans have faced unacceptable challenges in access to care in NH. For there to be confidence in the VA New England System, Dr. Mayo-Smith can’t be part of its future. @SecShulkin should remove him &amp; ensure bad actors are held accountable. https://t.co/J2LaUUpxrxI'm so inspired by @Chessy_Prout's courage &amp; willingness to tell her story &amp; let other survivors of sexual violence know they are not alone.

Falling means that you're pushing yourself. In that sense, whenever I fell I was happy to be on my face. It meant I was going full-tilt." #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/anvJeMcAqJDiscussing early STEM programs w/educators, administrators &amp; students at @PlymouthState Center for Young Children &amp; Families.

More inaction is not an option. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/c1qT69S623The @NBRC_Team has been an important economic development tool in rural NH. @PeterWelch @claudiatenney @RepJohnKatko @RepSheaPorter &amp; I urge governors of our states to support this critical program in light of @RealDonaldTrump proposal to eliminate it. https://t.co/uVPHvtN9Q0Happy birthday @SenatorHassan!

That's why I support legislation to bring back #NetNeutrality. #SaveTheInternetTime to act – The House just held the 43rd moment of silence for gun violence victims since the tragedy at Sandy Hook. I’m signing a petition to force a vote on comprehensive background checks. Universal background checks are supported by 97% of Americans. #EnoughIsEnoughInnovative programs like the Edna McKenna Community Corrections Center are a critical part of tackling the opioid epidemic.

Expanding access to training and apprentice programs is critical for growing our economy &amp; preparing people for careers in the 21st century economy. https://t.co/hZwP28n6vFThe internet must allow for the free exchange of ideas and information.

My deepest sympathy &amp; prayers are w/students, teachers, families, law enforcement &amp; first responders in Florida. We must finally take action in Congress to protect our children &amp; teachers and end this senseless violence.The American people deserve to know why Rob Porter continued to be employed by @WhiteHouse despite his inability to gain security clearance allegedly because of his domestic violence. Glad @TGowdySC will investigate this serious situation. https://t.co/PPDbtufTDRGood luck to @MikaelaShiffrin and Alice Merryweather in the slalom tonight!

But hopefully Porter has a great career... Truly sad. Domestic violence cannot be tolerated anywhere. https://t.co/YYv2rxADk1It’s alarming Rob Porter remained in an influential role at @WhiteHouse even as revelations about his domestic abuse were apparently known among senior Trump staffers.
