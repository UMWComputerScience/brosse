ICYMI: @MalcolmJenkins &amp; @TorreySmithWR penned an op-ed on why millions of Americans in Pennsylvania and across the country deserve a second chance at a Clean Slate. 

Read their op-ed here: https://t.co/GLAIIhl8PhLooking forward to joining @GovernorTomWolf, @amprog, and @FreedomWorks to discuss #CleanSlate legislation in Pennsylvania and in Congress. #CleanSlateAct https://t.co/HzXSovrBQaRebuilding unions is critical to rebuilding the middle-class, and the #Janus decision undermines the ability of public service workers to negotiate for decent pay and fair workplaces. https://t.co/Zjxuy1EKI9The #Janus decision is another dangerous ruling by #SCOTUS that has overturned 4 decades of precedent. https://t.co/k8aJcurmSlThe travel ban and religious test will not make us any safer and instead gives terrorists who seek to harm us a recruiting tool. As Americans, we must continue to fight for our values and take a stand against these harmful and dangerous policies.In the words of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, "The United States of America is a Nation built upon the promise of religious liberty." The #SCOTUS decision to uphold the #MuslimBan is deeply disappointing and runs counter to our American values. https://t.co/6I6bs2kWx1We are better off when all eligible Americans can vote. But now, millions of Americans are denied this freedom. It’s time for Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE so we have a government of, by, and for the people.The Voting Rights Advancement Act ensures that states with repeated voting rights violations are required to clear their election changes with the Department of Justice. That’s a commonsense voter protection to keep our elections fair #RestoreTheVOTESince the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder, more than two dozen states have enacted anti-voter laws that make it harder to register and harder to cast your ballot. Every American must be guaranteed a voice in our democracy – we must #RestoreTheVOTEFive years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but there is a solution. As a co-sponsor of the Voting Rights Advancement Act, I urge Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE.Our democracy only works when elections are free &amp; fair and all eligible voters are able to cast a ballot. On the anniversary of Shelby County v. Holder, it's time to #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/97WBGVJntlWe need to come together and pass comprehensive immigration reform. A working, bipartisan solution is the only answer to solving the humanitarian crisis at the southern border.The President’s executive order does not: 
🔴 reunite more than 2,000 separated children with their parents. 
🔴 end the crisis created at the border.
🔴 create long-term solutions to #KeepFamiliesTogether. https://t.co/u6l3kTmg6rToday, I was proud to vote for the bipartisan SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which will make strides in increasing access to treatment services and crack down on the illegal importation of dangerous Chinese fentanyl. Read my statement here: https://t.co/UBxfSDSjbqIn a @edworkforcedems hearing this week, I discussed my Clean Slate legislation with @CAPAction's @rebeccavallas. Clean Slate is a bipartisan solution that gives rehabilitated citizens with non-violent offenses a second chance to re-enter society and find a well-paying job. https://t.co/jOEC2UupaGThe #FarmBill is too important for one party to go it alone, and it is my sincere hope that we can come together and put forward a bipartisan bill that strengthens the farm safety net and connects people to healthy and nutritious food. https://t.co/jxriikP33BI'm disappointed that House Republican leadership chose to advance a blatantly partisan #FarmBill, and it is the reason I voted against this legislation today. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/NgZ6rGjZl7 https://t.co/H9vOAuavaRToday, I met with representatives from Delaware credit unions during their annual "Hike the Hill Day." We had a thoughtful discussion about ways we can protect our senior citizens from financial extortion and exploitation. https://t.co/2ItO87F4mUChildren should not be ripped from the arms of their parents.  Babies need to stay with their loving parents. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct stops the #Trump administration's government sanctioned child abuse policy. https://t.co/jNqEPexudCThe #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct establishes a preference for family unity, discourages the separation of siblings, and creates a presumption that detention is not in the best interests of families and children. https://t.co/3zW6mA77CuFACT: Family separation has been universally condemned by the child welfare community, immigration rights community, and medical professionals such as the American Pediatrics Association. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct#Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom, and today serves as a reminder that we must continue the fight for justice and equality more than 150 years after it began. https://t.co/89CE1a7Whq276 Black women serve in state legislatures, 19 Black women are members of Congress, and countless other Black women serve their communities as public officials. I'm proud to stand with @EmiliaSykesOH because we were elected by the people, and #WeBelongHere. https://t.co/yUzBOC1pH8I will continue fighting for our values, and I encourage you to stay engaged, stay informed, and stay vocal in your opposition. It is time for us to come together and create immigration policy that balances border security with our humanitarian responsibilities.This moment requires more than just words; it requires action. That’s why I’m joining @HouseDemocrats in introducing legislation that prohibits the @DHSgov from separating children from their parents, ends the prosecution of asylum seekers, and creates a plan to reunite families.The heartless policy of separating innocent children from their parents at the border is inconsistent with our values. This Administration has the power to end this crisis unilaterally without any vote from Congress.Our nation has long been a beacon of hope for people facing persecution. Yet, @realDonaldTrump and his administration have chosen to meet those seeking a better life with cruelty and inhumane treatment. https://t.co/7zERpgTjSVToday, I wish my dad and all dads a very Happy Father’s Day! https://t.co/DlgvB6xnH0As the moon finds its way into the night sky and the holy month of Ramadan comes to an end, I wish our Muslim friends and neighbors a happy and joyous #Eid! https://t.co/rAnfALNYw9TUNE IN: I'm live with @nwlc for a discussion about the #GOPFarmBill and its impact on farmers and families. https://t.co/kDYHPN9r1mLast night at the @nnedv reception &amp; today in my office, I spoke with #NNEDVAD18 advocates about my bill to reauthorize the Family Violence Prevention &amp; Services Act. Domestic violence has no place in American society &amp; we must do everything in our power to stand up for victims. https://t.co/jaYYKrJ7JgYesterday, I met with the young Delawareans who were appointed to our prestigious military service academies. They are among a select few of bright young men &amp; women who have answered the call of duty to defend our country against all enemies, foreign &amp; domestic. https://t.co/2vkRITWwT2The commission was charged with studying school safety, and the American people have a right to know about the root causes of gun violence in schools. We must put politics aside and put our students and communities first by taking a hard look at this epidemic. https://t.co/G5sAYnNfnbToday, I led a letter with 17 of my @edworkforcedems colleagues to @usedgov Sec. DeVos asking her to explain her testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee regarding the Federal Commission on School Safety. https://t.co/sbR9u6duYNYesterday, I discussed employment opportunities in Sussex County with Billy Banning &amp; Sarah Ruffcorn of @Trinity_Tweeps based in Seaford. We're grateful to have principle-driven companies like Trinity who invest in their local employees and contribute back to the community. https://t.co/DJ9xpJV9AVToday, I joined @EdWorkforcedems in asking @HHSGov Sec. Azar for specifics on what his agency is doing to combat rising insurance premiums. It's estimated that premiums will increase by 19% in Delaware, &amp; I'm calling on HHS to do more to lower costs &amp; stabilize the marketplace. https://t.co/pHHlwznwaSThis morning, I took part in Breakfast on the Farm to celebrate the partnership between @corteva and @FoodBankofDE. A special thanks to Corteva for donating not one but two checks to support the Food Bank of Delaware's innovative farm and their work to feed the hungry. https://t.co/blcKWxBclUIt was a pleasure getting to know the 270th Wilmington Friends School graduating class on Saturday. The creative, innovative, and caring class of 2018 is going to do great things, and I wish them all the best in their future endeavors! Congrats, graduates! https://t.co/drVJ6mwru0The only way to ensure the LGBTQ community is protected from the kind of discrimination in Masterpiece is to pass the #EqualityAct. We have come too far to roll back basic protections on discrimination. #OpenToAll https://t.co/EHlrjzKmD3The #SCOTUS ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop is narrow and specific to the facts of the case, but we cannot for one moment stop fighting against the rising discrimination against LGBTQ people across this country. #OpenToAll https://t.co/6onB9TyPeGYesterday, I had the honor to attend the DE Commission of Veterans Affairs' Memorial Day service &amp; pay tribute to the countless heroes who gave their last full measure of devotion to our great nation. We can honor them by keeping our promises to their families &amp; today's veterans. https://t.co/xFziWxrKX6In DE moms only make 72¢ for $1 a dad makes.  💸And the difference of annual median earnings between moms and dads is $16,000! #MomsEqualPayDayClosing the #GenderWageGap wouldn’t just help working mothers— it would also help the millions of families that rely on them! https://t.co/FG23RXK2cU via @ShriverCenter #MomsEqualPay #GenderWageGap.@nwlc reports that "Nearly 1 in 5 Working Mothers of Very Young Children Work in Low-Wage Jobs" &amp; are disproportionately #WOC. Such jobs often leave moms struggling to pay bills &amp; vulnerable to harassment. We need #equalpay &amp; #antiharassment protections 4 everyone! #MomsEqualPayThe #wagegap between mothers &amp; non-mothers is greater than between women &amp; men—&amp; actually getting bigger and is larger for low-wage workers." https://t.co/qHFHuWkAX9 #MomsEqualPay1 in 5 working mothers work in low wage jobs that require childcare, often in more irregular &amp; evening hours. Moms are already overworked and #childcare = college tuition in some states! Families need #MomsEqualPay! https://t.co/BAh9lyndr8Mothers’ wages are also impacted by a lack of support for women’s disproportionate caregiving responsibilities. #MomsEqualPayDid you know? ➡️ Being a mom is a greater predictor of wage discrimination than gender. #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/5UGTMeFQ4z#PaycheckFairnessAct is part of solution: We need #paidsickdays, #paidfamilyleave, affordable #childcare &amp; #raisethewage 2 achieve #MomsEqualPayThat's why I'm proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairnessAct because it would help bridge the wage gap for all moms. Let’s fight for #MomsEqualPay!All hardworking women and moms deserve to be paid equally &amp; recognized for their contribution to the national economy. #MomsEqualPayThanks to @NWLC for crunching the numbers for the wage gap for moms and creating great resources for #MomsEqualPay day 2018! https://t.co/BWVH2nvRkBToday, I took part in a gun violence prevention forum and heard the stories of students who have lived through senseless acts of terror. I stand with these young Americans in calling on Congress to pass responsible gun laws and make real change that protects our students. https://t.co/3QoNc7cGSSUSCIS’s goal for processing DACA renewal applications used to be 120 days so assess whether it makes sense for you to apply as soon as possible.

Today, I asked Sec.

I’ll be discussing issues before Congress, hearing directly from you, and taking your questions live. To join, sign up here: https://t.co/vi6G228CYT https://t.co/7x4XhN3Gf8As we gather more details about the school shooting at Santa Fe High School, one thing is clear: We cannot accept this as the world we live in, much less the world we send our kids to school in. Congress must act to prevent more innocent lives from being lost.👇🏽 https://t.co/jtxlnFQMQZI stand with @HouseAgDems in asking: Does the #GOPFarmBill even get the policy right?  Let's go back to the drawing board and craft a genuinely bipartisan farm bill that equips farmers and those in need with the tools to thrive in today's economy. https://t.co/5Z0iSjKrhNWe're voting on the #GOPFarmBill today. A bill that cuts $20 billion from SNAP – hurting children, seniors and people with disabilities – to pay for an untested, severely underfunded program. https://t.co/xKGe99fRsH#Organics account for nearly $50 billion in annual sales, and organic foods are an increasingly valuable market for farmers and ranchers. Yet, the #GOPfarmbill shortchanges funding for organics. https://t.co/dMk7dSYnvLHouse Republicans held more than 20 hearings on #SNAP, at which none of the witnesses recommended cutting benefits to expand workforce bureaucracy. #GOPfarmbill https://t.co/3ahJjLsLV9Rural schools, businesses, farmers and healthcare providers need high-speed broadband to provide adequate service to their communities and compete in the global economy. The #GOPfarmbill complicates #ruralbroadband funding, likely leaving these communities behind. https://t.co/p891nCJpl6#GOPFarmBill Fact: 70% of U.S. farmland will change hands and one fourth of our farmers will retire over the next three decades. Yet, the #GOPfarmbill drastically underfunds outreach efforts to the next generation of growers. https://t.co/VioReurqcaIn Delaware, 99% of our farms are family owned. We need to strengthen the farm safety and increase education and outreach efforts for the next generation of farmers.#GOPFarmBill Facts: An estimated 1.3 million people will be forced off of SNAP by the #GOPFarmBill’s workforce bureaucracy. https://t.co/oVJMuXOvfz#GOPFarmBill Facts: House Republicans say their bill doesn’t kick a single person off #SNAP. That’s not true. 265,000 kids will lose access to free school meals. https://t.co/dNFG1IN08z#GOPFarmBill Facts: This bill cuts $800 million in federal conservation programs. https://t.co/K9bfdN1muAFarmers take great pride in feeding America, but the #GOPFarmBill doesn't ease the pressures on their families created by the struggling farm economy. We must do better.Democrats oppose the #GOPFarmBill because it simply isn’t good enough. Not for farmers, not for consumers, and not for communities.During #NationalPoliceWeek, let's take a moment to thank all of the men &amp; women in blue who put their lives on the line to protect, serve, &amp; keep our communities safe. We are grateful for your sacrifice &amp; willingness to go beyond the call of duty. https://t.co/dU8ch4jJeOThe @BobbyScott /@RepJerryNadler Resolution requires Congress hold hearings to ensure that @usedgov &amp; @TheJusticeDept are in compliance of the Civil Rights Act, including unintentional discrimination from policies &amp; practices that have discriminatory effects. #RethinkDisciplineIn the past, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, @usedgov and @TheJusticeDept supported enforcement Title VI of the #CivilRightsAct of 1964. The same is expected for the @realDonaldTrump administration. #SaveYourVI #RethinkDiscipline.@thejusticedept &amp; @usedgov must uphold 2014 School Discipline Guidance Package, to remind schools of their legal obligations to administer school discipline without discriminating on the base of race, color, or national origin. https://t.co/umr3qA5tvdThe @USGAO findings substantiate claims that the severity of disparate treatment for students of color and students with disabilities persists. This is why the @BobbyScott/@RepJerryNadler Resolution is significant. https://t.co/umr3qAn4mL #SaveYourVI.@Edworkforcedems ranking member @BobbyScott and @RepJerryNadler introduced a new resolution to affirm support for disparate impact analysis as an enforcement tool of Title VI under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. #RethinkDisciplineAccording to a @USGAO report, Black students, boys, and students with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined in K-12 public schools – and disparities in discipline are prevalent as early as preschool. https://t.co/KVE30WW8Bz #RethinkDisciplineThe Supreme Court struck down segregation in public schools 64 years ago today. On this anniversary of #BrownvBoard, we must continue to advocate for equality and students' rights in the classroom. https://t.co/PJn9pyhfY6This is a missed opportunity – the result of a flawed process that shut Democrats out. The good news is: It’s not too late. Let's go back and craft a bipartisan #FarmBill that tackles food insecurity and equips #SNAP participants with the tools to earn a good living. https://t.co/ctNNBc2OG9I urge my colleagues to vote down the #GOPFarmBill because it cuts $20 billion from SNAP – hurting children, seniors and people with disabilities – to pay for an untested, severely underfunded training program. https://t.co/xKGe99fRsHHate and violence have gone on far too long against the LGBTQ community, today I am affirming my stand against it. There are too many powerful, beautiful voices hindered and lost to discrimination and violence. Speak out against homophobia, biphobia &amp; transphobia today! #IDAHOTWith violence and discrimination rampant in the LGBTQ community, we must all do our part to be kind and speak out against hate. That’s why I’m standing in solidarity with my #LGBTQ colleagues, constituents and all others against homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia.Our communities are diverse and inclusive. They’re full of people from different ages, races, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or minority status. They all deserve equal rights. #IDAHOTOn this International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, I am pushing back against the violence #LGBTQ communities face every day.Be kind to others; treat them as you would want to be treated. These simple words can mean a world of difference to a LGBTQ person who faces discrimination #IDAHOT #BeKindIt’s time to stop the hatred and violence against marginalized communities. #IDAHOT https://t.co/hyiE3OHdMzToday, I had the opportunity to talk about my bipartisan legislation which makes it easier for families to save for retirement. With 10,000 Boomers retiring daily, we're streamlining existing rules to expand savings options for employees while strengthening consumer protections. https://t.co/OYlK8Yg3ImLast night, I had the opportunity to witness history &amp; celebrate the first-ever graduating class of @ECHS_at_DSU! As high school students, the ambitious, energetic, &amp; inspiring class of 2018 amassed hundreds of hours of college credits &amp; built a school from the ground up! https://t.co/i7gzuOqgh5Today, I'm wishing my mother, Alice, my sisters, Thea and Marla, and all mothers a happy and fufilling Mother's Day! https://t.co/fUON3qtIsZIf you’re reading this, remember to #ThankATeacher! 
#TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/iPLPhnUSNyRight now, I'm joining @edworkforcedems for an important subcommittee hearing about addressing our nation's growing skills gap. We need to invest in programs that prepare students of all ages for good paying jobs and the #futureofwork! https://t.co/Z2AszCfn6iOur bill aims to increase #retirement savings by providing employers and employees with another tool to save for the future while boosting consumer protections for their retirement plans. https://t.co/ezVqAPQpS6This morning, I was proud to join @BGOV and my colleague @RepWalberg for an engaging conversation about the bill he and I co-authored, the Increasing Access to a Secure Retirement Act. https://t.co/QfsQlQEogHDelaware is thankful for the @SeniorCorps volunteers who dedicate their time to mentoring underserved youth &amp; helping elderly citizens. Their service is making a difference in our communities &amp; improving the quality of life for thousands in the First State. #SeniorCorpsWorks https://t.co/EdBm7y194xAs the First State begins to warm, an increase in smog makes breathing more difficult and poor air quality is a health issue that affects everyone. Biking, carpooling, and using public transportation are just three ways we can do our part to clean the air. https://t.co/tLCG5d90fhAccording to @NIDAnews, more than 115 Americans die of an opioid overdose every day.

We had a productive conversation about real ways we can create better communities through broader inclusivity. https://t.co/vcOk7q7Td1I’m proud of @JohnCarneyDE for joining this important consortium. It is critical that we work together across state lines to address our nation's #gunviolence epidemic. I look forward to the results of their study. #netde https://t.co/3IRj5ch0SOThe Administration is required to accept new #DACA applicants and uphold the current law. I will keep working toward a bipartisan and permanent #DREAMAct so that #DREAMers can stay without legal question. https://t.co/yhMkkvgK3xOnce again, Trump's decision to strip #DREAMers of their protected status has been struck down by the courts. 👇🏽https://t.co/VJEzAaOIDGDo you need help with the VA, IRS, Social Security, or another agency?

We enjoyed the food and learning from our future farming leaders. We're taking best practices from @William_Pennhs back to Congress to encourage more students to participate in programs like this. https://t.co/vzkEyH5L0vOn Friday, I toured @William_Pennhs's Farm-to-Table program with my friend Rep. @RodneyDavis. This program provides students with opportunities to engage in hands-on learning and gain valuable skills that will prepare them for future careers in agriculture and the culinary arts. https://t.co/cnHLnQfxqCWe celebrate clean air, clean water, and clean land. We only get one Earth, and it's on us to protect the one we have from changing climates and harmful pollutants. On this #EarthDay and every day, let's recommit ourselves to protect &amp; preserve our planet for future generations. https://t.co/PB479aExuCThe future of Agriculture is bright! Today, @RodneyDavis and I visited @corteva to learn about how they are using state-of-the-art technology to assist producers and help feed the world. https://t.co/6Njit7XjDbEarlier this week, I had the opportunity to share stories of empowerment with the @NC100BWDE. I'm proud to be a part of such a wonderful group of ladies who have made a difference in the lives of black women and girls throughout the First State for more than 20 years! https://t.co/yl5nAHxEgfThough tragic, we are thankful for heroes like Tammie Jo Shults and her "nerves of steel," for preventing the #flight1380 accident from becoming a catastrophe. As one of the first female fighter pilots in the Navy, she is proof that women can do anything! https://t.co/Z22iOoNFXRIt was great to see my friends @ChrisCoons, @SenatorCarper and @AgricultureDE Secretary Michael Scuse at the annual Ducks Unlimited dinner this week to talk about the importance of protecting and restoring Delaware's beautiful coastlines and wetlands. https://t.co/fmZYqf3yUhThat would be good government, a good use of taxpayer dollars, and what the people of Delaware sent me here to advocate for. #2018FarmBill #netde https://t.co/AasPb7lu5j.@HouseAgNews, if we are concerned with getting the policy right, then let's develop a program that feeds people and equips them with the tools needed to earn a good living in today’s economy. #2018FarmBillWhat happens if your child gets sick? Or your car breaks down? Should that mean you and your child go hungry for up to a year? #2018FarmBill https://t.co/AptNt0XaxeOn top of that, we’re creating #workrequirements that don’t sufficiently take into account the challenges people face in getting jobs or participating in this new program – like finding affordable child care, transportation, or healthcare. #2018FarmBillIt’s estimated that we’ll need an additional 3 million slots for workforce training programs under this proposal. With $1B in funding, that comes out to less than $30/person/month. That’s a drop in the bucket to provide workplace training to anyone. #2018FarmBillAs DE's former Secretary of Labor, I think it is ill-advised to scale-up a massive employment and training program and change work requirements without evidence-based results. That’s not good government. #2018FarmBill https://t.co/HTL4y2qMezSo, my question for @HouseAgNews is: If you’re concerned with “getting the policy right,” then why aren’t we taking the time to be thoughtful and get the results of pilot programs across the nation, like the one in Delaware? #2018FarmBillI believe in work. We all believe in work. I am a strong proponent of workforce development programs. That’s why this proposal was such a missed opportunity. #2018FarmBill3/ That doesn’t benefit our country, and that certainly doesn’t benefit the farmers and working families in Delaware. #2018FarmBill2/ And I was excited to join the urban-rural coalition that has traditionally made this process a bipartisan one. Unfortunately, that is not where we’ve ended up. We’ve seen our bipartisan work breakdown. #2018FarmBill1/ What I love about the Farm Bill, and Ag in general, is that it is comprehensive. It is urban, rural, and global; it covers family farmers, individuals on SNAP, global food security, biotech research, and our land-grant institutions. #2018FarmBillWatch my #2018FarmBill opening statement LIVE: https://t.co/Z5JmDxBzCD https://t.co/MH317jSZ8TFor DE, Agriculture contributes 30,000 jobs and $8B in yearly economic activity. It means a lot to my state, and I'm disappointed by the Majority's ideological fight that hurts family farmers and those who rely on the Farm bill to put food on the table. #2018FarmBillI had the pleasure of talking about the connections between research and federal policy with Wesley College student and 2018 @CURinAction winner Jeremy Wirick! Delaware is lucky to have so many students like Jeremy who care deeply about scientific research and development! https://t.co/ZPMZI4VwC0On this historically significant day for Sikhs, I'm wishing our Sikh American friends a happy #Vaisakhi! https://t.co/ctNVeccIbGToday on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pause around the world to remember the millions of lives lost during the Holocaust.

This bill would take meaningful steps toward reducing the #WageGap, improving our economy, and delivering justice for millions of Americans. #EqualPayDayIn Delaware, we're performing better than the national average, but we must press for #EqualPayNow to ensure that April 10, 2018 will be the last #EqualPayDay. #NetDEBased on the current rate, women's wages won't be equal to men until the year 2119. One more day of pay inequality is far too long to wait. This is about ensuring fairness, equality, valuing the contributions of working women everywhere. #EqualPayDayThe #WageGap only widens for women of color. African American women earn only 63¢ and Latinas earn only 54¢ for every $1 made by their white male colleagues. Now is the time to demand #EqualPay and end gender and racial discrimination. #EqualPayDayAcross the country, working women face wage discrimination that impacts their livelihoods, their families, and their ability to save for retirement. Women still earn only 80¢ for every $1 paid to their male counterparts for the very same work. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/pYlUz4Slq0Our interns play a critical role in helping me serve the people of Delaware.

I agree with George Class-Peters, Jr., senior class president and member of my Youth Advisory Council – children are the future, and we must invest in their safety. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/5bWgyxxiusStudents in Delaware and across the country, without exception, deserve protections under law. #SNDA spells out that students must be protected from discrimination based on gender identity &amp; sexual orientation - as well as race, religion, ability, &amp; national origin. #LetKidsLearnThe only thing students should be worried about is academic achievement, not getting bullied or discriminated against. #SNDA #LetKidsLearnDiscrimination, bullying, and harassment do not belong anywhere - let alone schools. The Student Non-Discrimination Act says in law that discrimination of any kind won’t be tolerated. #SNDA #LetKidsLearnThe Student Non-Discrimination Act will put an end to discrimination in schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity. All children should have access to an education free from discrimination. #SNDA #LetKidsLearnToday, I served as the Ranking Member for the @edworkforcedems subcommittee hearing on association health plans. I hope Congress will find a bipartisan solution to strengthen the ACA and increase access to affordable, comprehensive coverage for all. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/kLTHVRUCryHis passionate service and courageous leadership in ensuring all people had the right to live and love freely will leave a lasting mark on Delaware and our LGBTQ community. Steve was a champion for all of us, and I will always remember his warmness and bright smile. https://t.co/ZEXxrtfI0LSteve’s passing is heartbreaking for Rehoboth, the Delaware LGBTQ community, and the state as a whole. https://t.co/mrWmoq8mXLThank you, Delaware League of Local Governments for an engaging discussion about the issues facing our cities and towns. It's always great to be joined by my dear friend and colleague @SenatorCarper! https://t.co/gpOBG6FaaFI am proud of these young men and women for leading by example and showing us how to support one another in challenging times. #dewalkouts #edude https://t.co/swPAzjJafRDelaware's students are taking a stand against gun violence by walking out and saying, "enough is enough." #dewalkouts #edude  https://t.co/TeM9vI1fl4Today, 7K pairs of shoes were laid at the Capitol to represent the 7K children killed due to gun violence since Sandy Hook. My heart aches for their loved ones. It makes me think of the achievements and potential we've missed out on because their lives were cut short. https://t.co/ow33hFwD0I(2/2) Our young people have always been a driving force to make positive change. I’m proud of @PS_DuPont students for soaking up their history at @NMAAHC and embracing those lessons for their future.(1/2) Excited to be @PS_DuPont this morning to speak with students who recently visited the @NMAAHC. https://t.co/F6gPcTHrjHHappy #InternationalWomensDay! I’m inspired by the many women who’ve made progress in closing the gender-divide, but we cannot rest. We must keep making noise for equal representation in government, equal pay for equal work, and equal health outcomes for women everywhere. https://t.co/g7IPqaaC7jDuring #WomensHistoryMonth and every month, let's celebrate what we can accomplish when we empower and uplift women! Women have always led the charge in the march for progress, and I hope we can inspire every little girl to do anything she sets her mind to. #WomenLead https://t.co/3prooP7PwhDE's coastline is one of our most cherished resources. That’s why I was proud to testify before the House Natural Resources Committee today about my coastal mapping bill that will save taxpayer dollars, protect homeowners, and preserve our cherished coastal environment. #netde https://t.co/wWF9H1FNOoIt’s about being able to sleep at night knowing that we can look students like @DavidHogg111 in the eye because we’ve taken action, we’ve played a role in preventing another student, another teacher, another person from dying in vain. https://t.co/FlksMFbvAjCongress cannot stand by as a child being murdered in his or her school is normalized. It’s not normal, and we can do something about it. #NeverAgain #HonorWithActionTeachers, students, moms and dads across the country are begging us to take action. They’re begging us to give them some peace of mind so they no longer have to console students who are afraid that maybe next time, it will be their school. #HonorWithAction“We’re children. You guys are the adults. You need to take some action and play a role.” - @DavidHogg111, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Senior on @CNN last week.From our urban centers to our rural communities, every student deserves the opportunity to learn and grow in a safe environment. Let’s act now to protect children everywhere. #NeverAgainWe need to do right by our students and our neighborhoods by preventing the next shooting that takes anyone’s life. #HonorWithActionIt shouldn't take another mass shooting for us to deal with this crisis. Students are dying every day in and out of school buildings because of gun violence that plagues too many communities.From our classrooms to our neighborhoods, we need to create safe spaces for our students and communities to grow and thrive.We need to protect Americans by passing the #GVRO Act, banning bump stocks, expanding background checks, and preventing domestic abusers from obtaining deadly firearms.According to @Everytown, Americans are 25 times more likely to be shot and killed with a gun than people in other developed countries. We must act now by passing the #GVRO Act. #HonorWithActionI’m proud to co-sponsor the #GVRO Act, which is designed to prevent people who pose a threat to themselves or others from having access to guns. It’s already saving lives in the states which have adopted it. Read more about it here: https://t.co/qYQidnjq8OOur children’s lives are worth more than any @NRA donation. We’ve got to honor our responsibility to them with more than thoughts and prayers. #FaithAndWorks https://t.co/FlksMFbvAjCongrats to Mike Quaranta!
