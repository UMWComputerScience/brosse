https://t.co/MM3cuFaHO7People fleeing violence and seeking refuge in the United States are being treated like criminals. Parents don‚Äôt know where their children are.

https://t.co/CZ2VrbaT3y.@HouseGOP just passed a bill that will strip nutrition assistance from millions and take school lunches away from hundreds of thousands of school kids.

https://t.co/ejSKgLbgMoThis Executive Order is a sham. By not ending zero tolerance, President Trump is keeping families in jail. Children in jail.

All he‚Äôs done is trade one form of child abuse for another. https://t.co/sjobgbP9V4Refugees &amp; asylum seekers should be welcomed to the US. But President Trump‚Äôs callous policies are denying safe harbor to families fleeing horrific circumstances. We should be opening our arms to those seeking refuge, not slamming the door.#WorldRefugeeDay
https://t.co/CD5CtRefihNowhere are the consequences of the #GOPTaxScam more clear than in their proposed budget. After lavishing billionaires &amp; corporations with special kickbacks, @HouseGOP now wants to cut Social Security &amp; Medicare to pay for it.  
https://t.co/emGb2PArCYThis is important. @AppropsDems just passed an amendment that would force the Trump Admin to allow members of Congress into the detention facilities where children are being held.
#StopFamilySeparation https://t.co/o8m1qxeUw08 million people in Yemen are on the brink of starvation. But @HouseGOP can‚Äôt even muster the courage to ASK @SecPompeo to put diplomatic weight behind saving civilian lives in Yemen. 

How can they close their eyes to this suffering? https://t.co/JWMBqB63ZPThe Trump admin is committing human rights abuses in our own country. I sent a letter asking the UN to send observers to investigate the unconscionable separation of families at the border. These detentions are a violation of everything we should stand for.

#NDAA https://t.co/lMiyiu4VlNNot many good things to say about this wasteful, irresponsible #NDAA.

This ‚Äúimmigration‚Äù agenda is blatantly racist. #SaveTPS https://t.co/hsFv604J3M1 year ago, @HouseGOP passed #Trumpcare. While they didn‚Äôt succeed in turning it into law, they've managed to undermine the promise of health care for millions nonetheless. 
 
In fact, 2017 was the first year since #ACA enactment that uninsured rates went up. What a disgrace.According to Scott Pruitt, his role as EPA Administrator justifies taking lavish international trips at the taxpayers expense. Remind me again, why does Scott Pruitt still have a job? #BootPruitt
https://t.co/BR6fL5Qfq2Republicans are not the party of ‚Äúfamily values.‚Äù There‚Äôs no value in policies that lead to more hunger, more homelessness and more desperation. Make no mistake: the only families helped by @HouseGOP policies are named Koch and Mercer.Mind you, this is the same @HouseGOP that handed out a trillion dollars in tax giveaways to millionaires, billionaires, and corporations just last December - a holiday present for the rich, paid for on the backs of the poor.
https://t.co/0OY9MInMlYAnd we can‚Äôt forget @HouseGOP‚Äôs current #1 agenda item --- a Farm Bill that will gut food stamp programs and make America‚Äôs food insecurity crisis even worse.  
https://t.co/IF8dOCNRi5So, to recap, the Republicans‚Äô plan to fight poverty is preventing low-income women from accessing contraception, banning abortions, refusing to raise the minimum wage, and then undermining affordable housing programs.And only 1 in 5 families who qualify for federal housing assistance actually receive it. Meanwhile, @HUDgov @SecretaryCarson wants to triple the cost of housing for some of the poorest families in the United States.
https://t.co/ZEyPLTybDoRight now, there isn‚Äôt a county in America where a single parent working full time for minimum wage can reasonably afford a 2 bedroom apartment. 
https://t.co/Gi1w4iQ4yCI don‚Äôt know if @SpeakerRyan is aware of this, but children are expensive to raise. It‚Äôs impossible enough to survive on a minimum wage for one person, let alone feed, house &amp; clothe a whole family on a poverty salary.If Republicans want to fight poverty, one of the best investments we can make is in family planning. But instead they‚Äôre choosing to gut #TitleX &amp; take away women‚Äôs health options.Reading about these attacks on #TitleX ‚Äì a historically BIPARTISAN program ‚Äì I am honestly stunned by @HouseGOP‚Äôs hypocrisy. Title X programs help women stay healthy, plan their families, &amp; rise out of poverty. https://t.co/jjT7TPXaLWMany families seeking asylum are fleeing unimaginable violence &amp; terror.

This Administration‚Äôs repeated attempts to diminish critical services for struggling families are both counterproductive and cruel. https://t.co/YAKJN3jP6jSending good vibes to the @warriors tonight as they look to close the series against the @spurs! #NBAPlayoffs #StrengthInNumbersScott Pruitt &amp; his Flat Earth Society friends have brought a dangerous combination of ignorance, corruption and greed to the @EPA. We need to #BootPruitt before he causes any more damage to our planet. https://t.co/hXKnldQW5eThe Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program has reduced the number of unintended teen pregnancies &amp; keeps young people healthy. But rather than protecting this proven, evidence-based program, Trump's @HHSGov is undermining #TPPP to push their extreme, abstinence-only agenda. Shameful. https://t.co/x52MVzprGfDeeply honored to be included on the @Essence #Woke100 list with so many warrior women. The work of these women for justice and equality is the definition of #BlackGirlMagic ‚ú®
