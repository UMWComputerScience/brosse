Thank you! I agree and was marching too at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles. #KeepFamiliesTogetherMarch https://t.co/tO4UlR9RF5Today, we stand united in Los Angeles to send a clear message to the Trump administration: reunite the families and children that have been separated at our borders immediately! We must continue to hold this administration accountable because #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/X3kkWy1zRyCongratulations to the #Wilmington @YMCA for celebrating 20 years. This morning I attended their family fun picnic. Come out for some Zumba, a health screening and some family activities. #CA44 https://t.co/0f6SIbZZRGStopped by Houghton Park Senior Center in #NorthLongBeach this morning to talk about the services our office provides and invite seniors to my 2nd Annual Senior Fair. This is one of my fav parts of the job! #CA44 https://t.co/f0f7t3dwvT@perrybarber @RepDonBeyer @WhipHoyer @RepPeteAguilar @RepLindaSanchez @HispanicCaucus @RepLujanGrisham Yes. There are many organizations attorney across the country helping but there still a severe shortage for pro bono help.@perrybarber @RepDonBeyer @WhipHoyer @RepPeteAguilar @RepLindaSanchez @HispanicCaucus @RepLujanGrisham No representation. Some kids get placed with sponsors and family, some don’t. In many instances even when they are placed they can’t afford an attorney.What an image! These are the children that the Administration wants to lock up with their parents in jail because of a bs zero tolerance policy. And these are the children that are expected to represent themselves in immigration court. Think about that for a moment. https://t.co/dk8akWR7sJHorrified by the shooting in Annapolis at the #CapitalGazette. My thoughts and prayers for you @PhilDavis_CG, your coworkers and our first responders. How terrifying. https://t.co/kSm2V3VVg0If not for the good work of attorneys like @supportKIND &amp; @CCharitiesUSA, volunteering to represent these children, they would be facing judges with no representation. This is an injustice. I’ve represented immigrants seeking asylum and they need counsel! #KeepFamiliesTogetherJust witnessed an immigration court proceeding in Arlington where a judge was hearing asylum cases for children. Many of these kids are here alone, without parents to help protect them. #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/yvlwGDK0QbWatching the news out of #Annapolis. Thoughts and prayers to all involved including the first responders on scene. https://t.co/h5AIIExlYsKids belong in school-not court. I spent time today with young people who came to this country escaping violence and wanting what everyone deserves, a safe childhood. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/dRjToRCjbuAmazing time yesterday with @Hortons_Kids at @Nationals Park! Thank you to the volunteers who give their time to support at-risk youth. https://t.co/HSDrd6NY92Evelyn Granados from #Lynwood High School is our Congressional Art Competition winner! Her art piece, “Love is Love”, will hang in the U.S. Capitol for one year. This is exactly the kind of message we need in Washington right now. #CA44 https://t.co/WKZv3GbsWwThe #DREAM act would pass the House with an up-or-down vote. Republican leaders know that and have been afraid to bring it to the floor. Time’s up. It’s time to vote. #DACA #DreamersNow that the Republicans have failed to pass their anti-family immigration proposals, the leadership should let the House vote on bipartisan bills that could pass like the #USAact. #Dreamers and #DACA recipients deserve protection now!Glad to see the anti-family #Goodlatte2 bill fail to pass the House. We need to pass protection for #Dreamers and #DACA recipients now!On this National #HIVTestingDay, I encourage everyone to get tested for #HIV and make this a part of their health routine.

We will continue to work for fair wages, safe working conditions, and economic justice. #UnionProud #UnionStrong https://t.co/wiHhmfIaQwThis morning the #SCOTUS undermined the rights of 17.3 million workers by limiting the ability of unions to organize and advocate on their behalf. The #Janus decision will hurt our nation's teachers, firefighters and nurses. #JANUSvsAFSCMEWomen deserve the truth. Despite the #SCOTUS decision today, this isn’t over.  We will get right back up, and keep fighting to #EndTheLies at fake women’s health centers. #NIFLAvBecerra¡ATENCIÓN DREAMERS! Actualmente aún puedes solicitar la renovación de tu permiso #DACA. Si cumples con los requisitos para renovar tu permiso DACA, debes hacerlo ya ↓ https://t.co/WhdpxdUl6kThe #SCOTUS ruling is disappointing and shameful. I believe it is one we will look back on and regret. We must continue to fight discrimination; no one should be targeted because of their religion. #MuslimBan #NoMuslimBanEver #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/JLpONA91A2Speaking now about the unjust #SCOTUS decision on Trump’s #MuslimBan.

Thousands of children remain separated from their parents tonight. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/RLvoKpHFWDEvery American has the right to vote and to have a voice in our democracy. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the #VotingRight Act, it's time to restore voting rights protections through the Voting Rights Advancement Act.  #RestoreTheVOTENot content with eliminating the individual mandate in their #GOPTaxScam, Republicans are now trying to rip health coverage away from over 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. This is appalling. #ProtectOurCare!We still haven’t seen this administration’s plan to reunite children separated from their parents. This is a cruel consequence of Trump’s failed zero tolerance policy. We must fight to #KeepFamiliesTogether.My heart breaks with news that two firefighters were shot responding to an explosion in #LongBeach this morning. Sending my thoughts and prayers to the Long Beach community and the family of Capt.

Forever young. https://t.co/O2rQuW0cMOICYMI: Experts agree that we are inflicting emotional trauma by separating children from their parents. Yesterday I introduced legislation to compel the US to provide mental health services for these kids. https://t.co/70OcGpGD17Today I introduced legislation to provide kids who have been separated from their parents the mental health services they need. It’s the very least we can do. #FamiliesBelongTogether #EndFamilyDetention #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/tk0kjsNnyCSpeaking now @NRDems about my bill, the No Drilling in Our Backyards Act, and the importance of having at least a 1,500-foot buffer between oil wells and our homes and schools. Watch live: https://t.co/Hq49P8QcPAThe #GoodlatteBill is a sham. The administration likes to talk about zero tolerance. Well, we have zero tolerance for this president’s anti-immigrant agenda and the Republicans who enable it. #Immigration https://t.co/1YPuCd4DOBAbout to take the Floor opposing the GOP’s shameful Goodlatte immigration bill. Watch live here: https://t.co/gIa7pi4IO2Just spoke in the House about Trump's #FamilySeparation policy and executive order.

Is this the amount of thought behind the Administration's decision to forcibly separate mothers from their children? https://t.co/WiSjyPsv25The comments this morning by John Kelly are offensive and they don’t represent the America I know.

When that happens we all do better.#Momsdontneed immigration policies that separate mothers from their children. We should be building and strengthening families, not tearing them apart. Moms and their families need the #DreamActnow! #MothersDayThe Trump Admin singled out #Dreamers by rescinding advance parole for DACA recipients the same day they terminated DACA.

This is not how a man with nothing to hide acts. It is critical for Congress to act NOW and #ProtectMueller! https://t.co/83b0C9x7PaSave the date! I will be hosting a town hall meeting on water quality issues and brief the community on the Safe Drinking Water Act on May 2nd from 6-7:30pm in Compton at George Washington Elementary School. Please call my office at 310-831-1799 for more information. #CA44 https://t.co/eQ2D1KwUa6The deadline for filing taxes on income earned in 2017 is next Tuesday, April 17th. Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare your tax returns. Visit https://t.co/NP7kZRN20I for more information. #TaxDay https://t.co/bIYMAYXbMhThe ethics scandals for @EPAScottPruitt keep piling up. From silencing his critics at the EPA to wasting taxpayer dollars on first-class travel and luxury office furniture, his behavior has been egregious—even for this administration. It's time for Pruitt to resign. #BootPruittSo great to meet so many young ladies and remind them they are the future and can be anything they can want, including President of the United States. Thanks @ComptonUnified  @ComptonBulletin https://t.co/vCj7yY0CXUAt a time when illegal crossings at the U.S-Mexico border are at HISTORIC LOWS, President Trump wants to exploit our #military and our men &amp; women in uniform to advance his hostile #immigration policies and failing campaign promises. Fear and hatred are not American values.We honor his memory today by reflecting on his legacy and continue on the path forward towards justice. #MLK50Today marks 50 years since the assassination of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His sacrifice and commitment to fighting injustice and inequality lives on as we continue to work towards realizing his dream. https://t.co/UitYKvoSbPDeeply saddened to hear of the loss of four marines. My thoughts are with their families. Grateful for their service to our country. https://t.co/qlw0l7HrHdI want to thank @MyLynwood’s city council and staff for their leadership to our community. At tonight’s council meeting, I provided a legislative update, including the fight against the citizenship question in the #2020Census, and a few constituent success stories from #CA44. https://t.co/vJGMG7oSSmIt’s always great to stop by the Watts Gang Task Force and provide an update on my work in Congress. I’m thankful for groups like this that bring residents, organizations, and law enforcement together to work as a coalition. #CA44 https://t.co/RexmnHHNeSWishing everyone a #HappyEaster! May today bring you all together for a great celebration filled with hope, health, and happiness. #Easter2018Beginning tonight at sundown, I'd like to wish all a blessed and happy #Passover. Chag Sameach!The Trump Admin’s attacks on our planet, air, and water continue. Now they are weakening the #EPA fuel economy standards that have contributed to lower emissions. We need #ScienceBased public policy that acknowledges #ClimateChange. https://t.co/iNe7wNya4KCongrats to all of the women recognized tonight by the @SanPedroChamber for #WomensHistoryMonth! TY for paving the way for future gens to have better access to the arts, business opps, and community services. Your contributions to #SanPedro is making #CA44 a better place to live. https://t.co/eUMbh4e6QdLast year I visited Hector &amp; other deported veterans in Mexico. Proud that I could write a letter supporting his naturalization process and return to the US. https://t.co/VfDcggcHg2Wonderful to hear that Hector Barajas, who founded the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana “the Bunker,” is finally able to come home. It’s time to bring all our #DeportedVets back to American soil. https://t.co/hNKg05LYiHTY to all who joined us tonight for our 2nd #Compton townhall. So many engaging residents to discuss issues and constituent services. From gun violence, DACA to infrastructure, we covered many topics. If you missed it, contact our office for a meeting! #CA44 https://t.co/Oh70Bsj3AuThis Administration has no heart for women and children, this time he goes after pregnant women. Heartless Trump endangers the health of moms with this move and increases chances of miscarriage. https://t.co/6XyAed8HwqAlma Pleasant is one of the most humble, selfless, and generous women I know. Thank you for opening up your home every year to host an appreciation luncheon for #Compton city employees. Your service to @ComptonUnified and our community is truly unparalleled. #CA44 https://t.co/HrHFpdZo1UIncluding a citizenship question on the #2020Census is a political attempt to suppress participation. This dangerous decision will have lasting consequences; jeopardizing essential funding for immigrant and low-income communities. Everyone counts! https://t.co/QrQhDsjw5XMany thanks to the #Wilmington Neighborhood Council for your service and everything you do to bring residents together. Thankful for the opportunity to speak with you all tonight and provide some updates on my work in Congress to improve the quality of life for families in #CA44. https://t.co/yJqrOOX2gp“When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.” – Malala Yousafzai #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/MMaZge2T4pThank you @LapdHarborDiv for your service to the Harbor area. It was great stoping by your community Roll Call in San Pedro today and see you in action. #CA44 https://t.co/YYmeYVPGScAdding a citizenship question to the #2020Census is a way to intimidate immigrant communities and is another example of the Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant agenda. We must push back against this decision so that everyone counts.
