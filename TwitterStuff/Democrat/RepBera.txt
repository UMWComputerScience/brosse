We’ve also helped return nearly $5.2 million to local taxpayers. 7/After 10 long years of seeking assistance with his immigration case, Jon said he really appreciated my team’s fast work and efforts to keep him updated with progress on his case. 6/My office worked quickly to schedule Jon an interview with immigration services in Sacramento, and just a few months later, Jon finally received his green card. 5/Then Jon contacted my office hoping we could inquire about the ongoing delays and help him get the stability he desperately needed for his business. 4/The uncertainty began to take a toll, and he couldn’t devote himself as fully as he wanted to to his business. 3/Unfortunately, even though he had been in the country legally for years, Jon kept having one delay after another getting his green card. 2/Meet Jon. He came to the U.S. in 2002 to pursue the American Dream and start his own small business. He did just that a few short years later, putting people to work in Sacramento.  1/ https://t.co/CzpOlUZXqkPlease always feel free to call us at (916) 635-0505 or visit https://t.co/7Lq7Sb2TtK to learn more.  11/I’m pleased to share some of the stories of the folks we’ve helped here so you can see how we may be able to help you, too. 10/My office has now helped more than 10,000 people right here in Sacramento County.

She and her family were able to make the trip and pay their respects to her grandmother.  7/We followed up with the State Department and learned a mistake was made processing Courtney’s request. 6/After hearing Courtney’s story, my office got right to work.  5/Needless to say, it was an emotional time for her family. 4/She had earlier applied for new passports, but now she needed them much more quickly to go on her trip and she was concerned they wouldn’t arrive in time. 3/Courtney’s grandmother had sadly passed away in Canada and she wanted to take her infant daughter along to attend the funeral. 2/Meet Courtney. She lives in Folsom with her young family and came to my office looking for help. 1/ https://t.co/WRB9u5ZJW5Women seeking answers about their health should be able to receive accurate, unbiased medical information and counseling. I am very disappointed with the Supreme Court decision today blocking the California law that requires pregnancy centers to more fully disclose what they are.As a doctor, I took an oath to empower patients to make the best health care decisions for their own personal circumstances. Crisis pregnancy centers do not do this — and they deliberately mislead those seeking help.

My office contacted the VA to expedite Sal’s benefits and the situation was resolved within a month. 5/As the bills mounted, Sal contacted my office to help with his VA disability claim – we got right to work. 4/Unfortunately, Sal later received tests that his cancer had returned. It was a very stressful time for Sal and his finances. During his second treatment period, the VA had not yet provided Sal with his back-pay benefits, adding to his stress. 3/Sal was diagnosed with prostate cancer related to his exposure to Agent Orange.

We  followed up with the IRS and were able to help resolve the situation and  send Steve his refund. 4/The IRS told Steve they wouldn’t process his tax return until he provided a proof of identity and many past tax returns supporting his claim. They said he needed to complete an in-person interview, which would stop Steve from performing surgery on short notice. 3/Last year, Steve filed his taxes in March, well ahead of the filing deadline. He was owed a substantial tax refund, so he waited to hear back from the IRS.
