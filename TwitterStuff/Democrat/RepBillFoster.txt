A free press is the foundation of our country’s democracy - this means freedom to express ideas without persecution or harm. We honor the memory of the individuals we lost today with a recommitment to the freedom of all people to go to work or school without fear of violence. https://t.co/eMUMcsFG6nI am proud to announce that @UofStFrancis will receive over $950,000 from the @NSF to provide scholarships for undergraduate #STEM majors who are pursuing teaching careers. #IL11 https://t.co/H4J5LeHKLiSimply put, House Republican leaders wasted our time with a failed #immigration bill that provided no real solutions to the immigration crisis. https://t.co/XgO7xsd9nVI am deeply concerned that the Supreme Court’s #Janus decision will weaken our strong labor unions that have given our workers a safer work environment, fair wages, and collective bargaining rights against unfair working conditions. https://t.co/WtuZBBJQ5cToday is the third anniversary of the #SCOTUS decision that legalized marriage equality, but we need to do more. The Equality Act will extend equal protections to #LGBTQ community. It’s time to end the discrimination that is still legal in 30 states. #EqualityForward #LoveWinsWomen deserve affordable and accessible health care. This includes access to facts that are clear and answers to their questions without bias. #EndTheLies https://t.co/4hC9GVfWHQIt’s a sad day for our country when our legal system condones bigotry and xenophobia. I will continue to hold this administration accountable for their actions. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/PqjfmRD1Qs.@realDonaldTrump’s cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reunification. Even worse, they deported some moms and dads before they were able to recover their children. We must #KeepFamiliesTogether! https://t.co/71MMWBMMj1Voting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, Americans want the full freedom to vote back. It’s time to #RestoreTheVOTE. https://t.co/27dp86MeEcAll of the great images from #CephalopodWeek are a reminder of the diverse creatures that live in the oceans and the need to protect them for future generations. (Maybe every week should be #CephalopodWeek) https://t.co/brTFuSTCgsI voted for the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act because it expands medication-assisted treatment for individuals who struggle with opioid dependency. https://t.co/u7oNaJOf8SI voted against this legislation because it did not #ProtectDREAMers or offer them a pathway to citizenship. It would also expand family separation, making an already condemnable situation even worse. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/VLxVh3E76KJoin me on Monday in Aurora for an important discussion I’m hosting on the risk of cyberattacks. #cybersecurity https://t.co/sHnlXTvH2LYesterday, I called on the @NSF to implement reforms for a better work environment for all scientists and researchers. https://t.co/09KdnSr63OI’m proud to stand with @NancyPelosi, @RepJerryNadler, @RepGutierrez, and all @HouseDemocrats to call on @realDonaldTrump to #KeepFamiliesTogether.

I continue to condemn the separation of children from their parents. We must stand up together for common decency and morality. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pMCXa4sNdsThe situation at the border remains disturbingly immoral and against everything our country represents. @realDonaldTrump has made it U.S. policy to separate children from their parents.

I have co-sponsored legislation to make our communities safe. There’s no reason why we can’t take meaningful action to end these tragedies. #NeverAgain https://t.co/0xOWNtd0FXThe #GOPFarmBill is an attack on hardworking Americans. Just a few months after Republicans gave a massive tax break to their wealthy friends, they want to force an estimated 2 million hungry Americans off SNAP. #ProtectSNAPI proudly signed the #DischargePetition tonight to bring legislation to the House Floor to #ProtectDREAMers. I’ve supported the #DREAMAct for years because these young people deserve a pathway to citizenship.Today marks the 64th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision #BrownvBoard. It is alarming that @POTUS has nominated judges to the federal bench who refuse to say the decision was correct. https://t.co/r3DzTrtJLnWe are LIVE now! https://t.co/8GGckxfUEmNo one should face discrimination because of who they love or their gender identity.

Many thanks to @Fermilab for the excellent tours. https://t.co/1BC8ojqWFhThis isn’t a plan; it’s a series of meaningless talking points that will do nothing to help hardworking Americans who pay too much for prescription drugs. https://t.co/kTWuMUvCDXProud to stand with @RepMaxineWaters and @FSCDems to fight against discrimination in auto lending. Hardworking Americans deserve rules that promote fairness and equality - not the kinds of discrimination Republicans voted to allow this week. https://t.co/shG8DrAORNA free and open Internet is crucial for innovation and economic growth.

That's why we need #ABetterDeal to bring back the Office of Technology Assessment so we are prepared for technological changes.Today, I was proud to reintroduce legislation to fund the Office of Technology Assessment so that Congress can lead on technical issues that could have serious effects on our country’s future. https://t.co/XQhudvXruBI've said it once, but I'll say it again. If @EPAScottPruitt cared as much about science and the environment as he cares for telephone booths and first class travel, the @EPA would actually get back to solving #climatechange and protecting environmental regulations. #BootPruittAll the more reason we need to invest in our infrastructure and make sure everyone has access to safe and reliable ways to get to work, Hogwarts, Ilvermorny, or wherever your daily commute takes you here in Illinois. https://t.co/f9cfLGbwG1Proud to introduce bipartisan legislation with @SteveKnight25 to provide a much needed boost for research on #energy storage that could pave the way for the next big development in battery technology. https://t.co/jnVnw8M7VeFour years later, the families in Flint, Michigan still do not have access to clean drinking water. We must make the investments in our infrastructure so this crisis never happens again. #DontForgetFlintThank you to @AFGENational for allowing me to speak today.

It’s time to put science above politics. #BootPruitt #DefendScience https://t.co/msr8OhWdAxThis #EarthDay, we must commit to protecting our planet for future generations. It’s time to accept the fact that #climatechange is largely man made and work together to prevent rising temperatures. #EarthDay2018All Americans deserve affordable and accessible health care regardless of their gender or sexual identity. This decision is heartless and deliberatively destructive to the health and wellbeing of #transgender Americans. https://t.co/XVhDuRPFcfWe cannot and should not allow our children’s time at school to fill with fear of another shooting.

My thoughts are with her family at this time. https://t.co/aCSOaG9JhqOn #TaxDay, it's important to remember that tax cuts don’t pay for themselves. So how do Republicans want to pay for the #GOPTaxScam? By cutting crucial benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Hardworking Americans deserve better. https://t.co/DArNE6wdilThat’s why I have repeatedly introduced a resolution in Congress to bring back the Office of Technology Assessment. Congress cannot sit idly as technology plays an increasingly important role in our lives, communities, and democracy. #OTA https://t.co/U0eETMQPHtThe use of chemical weapons is absolutely condemnable, but the American people deserve to know the long-term strategy for this response. @POTUS should come to Congress for an Authorization of Use of Military Force with a clear strategy and clear objectives. https://t.co/MO7xfyTiwxToday, I was proud to introduce a resolution to support #science diplomacy in the U.S. and around the world. https://t.co/atVNbGC201.@realdonaldtrump has denied the science of #climatechange and let @EPAScottPruitt gut environmental regulations. It’s dangerous for our leaders to ignore scientific facts for political gain. RT if you agree that the Trump Administration should stand up for scientific facts.The so-called Balanced Budget Amendment was nothing but a Republican attempt to pay for the #GOPTaxScam by cutting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. https://t.co/RC5MOSe0yhToday, we remember the millions of people who perished because of who they were and what religion they worshiped. We also reflect on the destructive power of authoritarianism &amp; pledge to never forget the dangers it poses to freedom &amp; human rights. #HolocaustRemembranceDay https://t.co/JJeoHdMj6U.@SpeakerRyan may be getting ready to leave Congress, but first he has plans to attack Medicare. His “balanced budget act” would gut Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security. And it would be unnecessary if Republicans had not given their friends a generous tax break last year.Great to meet with @NCRC today to make sure we have an economy that works for everyone. https://t.co/k22HuyE8LROn average, women are paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. For women of color, the #wagegap is much larger. It's time to end this destructive discrepancy. #EqualPayDay #talkpay https://t.co/EZ3JCxrDFMThis news shows just how high the costs of the Republicans' tax plan actually is. The new tax law simply punted trillions of dollars of debt down the road for our children to repay.

His genius was only matched by his perseverance, reminding us that we should never let adversity stop us from exploration.The last time the @CDCgov was allowed to study #gunviolence, researchers found that more guns (not less) made homes and communities more dangerous. It’s past time for Congress to act. https://t.co/U4RyNWeWEMAs @POTUS talks about a wall that would waste millions of taxpayers’ dollars, I will work to ensure real investments are made in rebuilding and modernizing our infrastructure. The President’s #InfrastructureScam is not enough to fix our country’s roads and bridges.Happy International Women’s Day! Today, we celebrate the trailblazing efforts of so many women who made our society more equal. We also recommit ourselves to the progress we have yet to achieve for full equality. #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2018This news is exactly why Congress needs to do more to help individuals who struggle with opioid dependence.

Best of luck in the finals! #NSB2018 https://t.co/7RpPrTnnmMMaybe he should ask a scientist or two what they think. https://t.co/PYC0ubbcFE#DREAMers are hardworking college students and members of our armed services. They enrich our communities with their leadership. They make great contributions to our economy and GDP. They deserve a path to stay in this country. #ProtectDreamers #DREAMAct https://t.co/eKZRivzi3jToday, I introduced legislation to boost the growth of the national Fab Lab network and provide access to the tools to develop new ideas. #STEM https://t.co/aoJTqJDlkoThis February we honor the sacrifices and accomplishments of those who came before us – and recommit ourselves to working each day to expand opportunities for all Americans. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/fsaNs7FKpcJoin us next Monday at @BenU1887 to discuss the Trump Administration’s recent decision to repeal #netneutrality rules that promote a fair and open Internet. https://t.co/IU8NiEKFQeThe release of the classified information in the #NunesMemo is an egregious attack on our independent law enforcement system. The Republican Party should stop this toxic behavior &amp; put the interests of the United States ahead of political advantage. https://t.co/A3lYaxmSGmGreat to run into the other science guy @BillNye this week! https://t.co/qNA7EwzAZiGood news today for consumers. An appeals court ruled the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is constitutional. https://t.co/FUEqL9AndyI was disappointed in the President's #SOTU address tonight. Once again, President Trump has failed to unite the country and offer Congress tangible policy proposals that would rebuild and repair our infrastructure, grow our economy, and combat the opioid epidemic.I joined my colleagues today to say #TimesUp and to show solidarity with the women who have said #metoo. No woman should ever have to endure sexual harassment, abuse, or assault. She should also not have to worry about repercussions if she reports it. https://t.co/LibjMul572Proud to have my #SOTU guest, Ana Campa Castillo, here in Washington to show @POTUS the invaluable contributions our #Dreamers are making to our country. #ProtectDREAMers https://t.co/v3kjg5hv94#WeRemember the victims of the Holocaust, including the millions of Jewish men, women, and children who were massacred. We must honor them by never hesitating to stand up against bigotry and racism wherever we see it. #HolocaustRemembranceDayGreat visit yesterday to Brooks Middle School in Bolingbrook with the students who take part in @GirlsWhoCode. https://t.co/lny11BUlGrThey asked tough questions! It was great to see so many young students engaged in current events and issues. https://t.co/qQMH5zCSKEThank you for inviting me! https://t.co/ZEqPmEC46NI'm excited to announce my guest for next week's State of the Union Address. Ana Campa Castillo is a DREAMer, and her work is just one of the examples of the great contributions these young people make to our society. #ProtectDreamers #SOTU https://t.co/noV7uKmFkpThe #FutureofWork is one of the most pressing issues our economy will face in the next generation. I'm glad to see these initiatives and hope that we will continue to work together to come up with solutions. https://t.co/rv9hXtJpXDCongratulations! https://t.co/CKu4hTm0F0I’ve called on @POTUS to declare the #opioidepidemic a national emergency and provide full funding for treatment and addiction programs. https://t.co/XHCNCFYi9FI got a first-hand look at the brand new solar panels atop the old Aurora Public Library building. The Support Companies technology group utilizes these panels for 15 percent of their power needs at this site - a great example of local companies taking the lead on clean energy. https://t.co/ALuMWOD9jWI supported the continuing resolution to give Republicans time to make good on their promise to hold a vote on the #DREAMAct. These continuing resolutions have been a disaster for our military, health care system, &amp; communities fighting the opioid epidemic. #TrumpshutdownI’m in my office this morning ready to work on a deal to end the #TrumpShutdown. There’s no reason why we can’t find a long-term budget deal to open the government as we #ProtectDREAMers and fund CHIP. https://t.co/a6W6PVxhdSAs we come to the close of day two on the #TrumpShutdown, I remain ready and willing to work on a budget deal, CHIP funding, and a solution for #DACA. This #shutdown is unnecessary. #ProtectDreamersI’m ready and willing to do the work to open the government, but Republicans are doing nothing to put an end to the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/fQvjYFl9NzThis shutdown is entirely unnecessary &amp; counterproductive. I will remain in Washington to do the job my constituents expect of me. We need a long-term budget deal, a solution for DREAMers, &amp; CHIP funding - all things a majority of Americans support. #ProtectDreamers #ExtendCHIP https://t.co/9OOHaYjYKYTemporary patches to budgets are unnecessary and cost our military money we can actually put to good use for our national security. It’s time for Republican leadership to end to temporary fixes. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/W51eu3tSpHI voted against the continuing resolution, because it is just another temporary patch. Republicans have had months to negotiate a bipartisan deal to finalize a budget, provide funding for #CHIP, and come up with a solution to #DACA and #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/sMiemrnXfMProviders’ beliefs should not stand in the way of a woman’s access to health care. Women should be able to seek medical care without worrying if their providers’ personal beliefs will affect their medical decisions. https://t.co/xfm2BTvFnn#MLKDay is a chance to reflect on the justice and equality that Dr. King devoted his life to for all Americans. Let's join together to stand against the forces of hatred and intolerance in our country and in the world.President Trump's comments are disgusting, divisive, and beneath the office he holds. America has been built by people from countries around the globe - it is what has made us so strong. https://t.co/zYLfM2GkYtYesterday, a federal judge ordered a nationwide injunction on @POTUS’s cruel move to end the #DACA program – a victory for the nearly 800,000 #Dreamers who’ve known no other home than America. https://t.co/Y1gbbQPlwVI had a wonderful meeting with #Dreamers this morning from my district and around IL. We owe it to these talented young people to act on #DACA. #ProtectDreamers #DreamAct https://t.co/jnEAA6HuNbAs a physicist, I know all too well the kind of destruction these weapons can inflict on the world. @POTUS should show real leadership here - understand the gravity of his words and work toward stability instead of aggravated hostility. https://t.co/TmQcxetOAg2017 was a busy year! Here’s a look at the work we did on behalf of the people of #IL11 in 2017. https://t.co/gO7vlJMdKnSpending time with family and friends is what defines this time of year. Merry #Christmas to everyone celebrating with loved ones tonight &amp; tomorrow! https://t.co/nJKm7vniabThe work that comes out of @CDCgov is too important for our country’s public health to censor the budget requests for critical public and global health programs. Any order banning words or phrases from these requests must be retracted. https://t.co/yNWWD4vDhMI voted against the #GOPTaxScam because it’s a massive gift to large corporations and wealthy campaign donors – paid for with more than $1 trillion in new debt that our children must repay in the future. https://t.co/XUGatlqLmH.@POTUS and his lack of empathy is abhorrent and sets a dangerous precedent with his disregard of #constitutional #reprorights. Everyone —regardless of immigration status — deserves access to basic #healthcare, including reproductive care. #JusticeForJane https://t.co/eTWw6KRwWiLast night, I spoke to constituents about the #GOPTaxScam. I oppose this bill because it’s clear it will hurt hardworking families in Illinois and will also leave our children with more than $1 trillion in debt to repay in the future. Americans deserve better. https://t.co/nXiZAzZ03QWe cannot erase away scientific research that shows #climatechange is real, largely man made, and poses a threat to our future. What we can do is adhere to policies that reduce carbon emissions and invest in green technology. It’s time for @POTUS to get #backtoscience. https://t.co/SPFrwS5Gp2Recently, more than 300 students took part in Naperville North High School's FIRST Lego League tournament – a program designed to inspire young people's interest in #STEM subjects. https://t.co/c9JSVtbOCHTime is running out! Today is the last day you can sign up to get health insurance. Head over to https://t.co/VSQ6O6PRjs now or call 1-800-318-2596 and find a plan that works best for you. #GetCovered40 years ago the very first #StarWars film captured our imaginations and inspired a generation of Americans to pursue their dreams in art, technology, and science. Tonight, #TheLastJedi continues that tradition.We cannot overstate how much damage this decision could have on a free and open Internet. We must maintain #NetNeutrality so that innovation and the free exchange of ideas does not disappear. https://t.co/muERRkeKuY#NetNeutrality protects innovators and small businesses in our district — they can't afford @FCC efforts to undermine the open internet. https://t.co/iJhIIbRT6rToday marks five years since the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook. Since 2012, there have been more than 1,700 mass shootings in our country. We need more than just moments of silence. We need to #HonorWithAction and pass commonsense gun safety laws. https://t.co/NumfZMcKiCWe need to #ProtectTheArctic for future generations. Using the #GOPTaxScam to open up drilling in the #ArcticRefuge is reckless and would destroy a natural treasure.Every day of inaction on #DACA costs 122 #Dreamers their status. This is unacceptable - Congress must pass the #DreamAct now. https://t.co/gHpYRV43ShWishing everyone in Illinois and across the world a very #HappyHanukkah. https://t.co/gMLMXEZkCgToday marks the two-year anniversary of the #ParisAgreement – a moment when the world's nations joined together, committing to fight climate change. @POTUS may have withdrawn from the agreement, but the American people are #StillIn.Great news for our #transgender men and women in uniform who stand ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/T705ans09WDon’t forget! This Friday is the deadline to #GetCovered through the health care marketplace for 2018. Visit https://t.co/RYiWxIYGRo for information on how to find a health care plan that is right for you.ICYMI: Check our this story about Ted Petry, the last surviving witness of the first atom split. It’s both a reminder of the incredible experiments that led to the development of nuclear weapons and the progress we’ve made to monitor them worldwide. https://t.co/YAadt8ZB6pI voted against the continuing resolution because it does nothing to address the long list of priorities to resolve - the DREAM Act, stabilizing health care marketplaces, and guaranteed funding for millions of children’s health care. https://t.co/VhDu4EsosAAll the more reason the GOP tax plan should not eliminate tax exempt bonds used to build affordable housing. We need tax policies that increase the availability of affordable housing - not give corporations a tax break. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/40zDZPJFtMThis report has deeply troubling implications for our country’s reputation as a leader in #science and innovation. It’s time for Congress and the Trump Administration to prioritize science and technical expertise in federal agencies. #backtoscience https://t.co/FkQ0W6vnuhI co-authored an op-ed with @RepMikeQuigley and @RepSchneider on how the GOP’s tax plan would hurt families in Illinois. It’s time for Congress to put hardworking Americans first and provide real tax reform. https://t.co/0AttH8n7eGRepublicans’ so-called “tax reform” is nothing more than a #GOPTaxScam that will leave everyday Americans paying more so the rich can pay less. We need real tax reform that provides relief for hardworking Americans, not wealthy families or corporations.Proud to work with @RepMarkTakano on the #National3DPrintingDay resolution and highlight the opportunities and innovation 3D printing is providing our country. https://t.co/dIiG94J2OaOn #WorldAIDSDay, I’m celebrating the advances in medicine &amp; education that are slowing the spread of HIV &amp; recommitting to the work that lies ahead. #EndAIDS2030. https://t.co/7a0aiQdW4tThe #GOPTaxScam raises taxes on 82 million middle class families while giving corporations massive tax cuts. We need to put hardworking families first - not big business.Just sent a letter to @DirectorCFPB with @FSCDems congratulating her on her new position as acting Director of @CFPB. #DefendCFPB https://t.co/uIaSBirAzUJoin me on Saturday at @IMSA_ for an interactive #STEMconnect event. https://t.co/eJtQE2ik3aWithout the #DREAMAct, our economy would lose $460.3 billion from the national GDP over the next decade. It's time to act to provide a permanent solution for #DREAMers. #ProtectDREAMersHappy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/yRgsU9fXf4I am opposed to any attempt to blatantly restrict access to Internet content. These kinds of decisions would harm the exchange of information and innovation. https://t.co/EqHJbWzWwgToday, we remember the #trans lives we lost. I stand with the #trans community and condemn hatred and discrimination against all #trans people. No one deserves to live in fear of violence because of their gender identity. #TDOR https://t.co/TCmDnR5apPToday, we recognize the need to end #PancreaticCancer and fund research that will lead to better treatments and a cure. #WPCD https://t.co/aUynLdjwUCI voted against the #GOPTaxScam because it will hurt middle class families in Illinois, slash Medicare funding, and add trillions to our national debt just so the wealthiest Americans get a tax break. https://t.co/sWuS0GPPN6I am opposed to the #GOPTaxScam bill on the House Floor today because @HouseGOP wants to raise taxes on middle class families, cut taxes for the wealthy, and add $1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit.Thank you to everyone who stands up for a woman’s right to choose. All women deserve the right to health care. #birthcontrolishealthcare https://t.co/YcRNHVxNUGI’m proud to announce that @JolietJrCollege will receive nearly $650,000 from @NSF for #STEM education programs! https://t.co/zmo5Pkw4jUWe know that #climatechange is real and largely man made. That’s why I’m #stillin and support solutions to protect our planet and it’s future. https://t.co/1hAoWh7XxnThe #IranDeal gave us an unprecedented opportunity to access Iranian nuclear sites. As a result, we have the diplomatic and scientific framework to monitor any action the Iranians may take to build a nuclear weapon. It is working. https://t.co/MPmOW5pgkmHappy Veterans Day! Our men and women in uniform have risked their lives to protect and serve our country at home and abroad. Today, we recognize and honor their service and sacrifice. #VeteransDayToday, I proudly introduced bipartisan legislation with @RepMarkTakano &amp; @cathymcmorris to make sure our service members and their families receive the full education benefits they are promised. https://t.co/ujQbEOoJq0Reminder: Join me tomorrow evening in #Joliet for a discussion about identity theft and data security. https://t.co/nOYf0NC5kO.@EPAScottPruitt should rescind his misguided decision to remove EPA board scientists.
