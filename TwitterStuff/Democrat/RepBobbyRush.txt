“It remains appalling that House Republicans disregarded the destructive nature of this Farm Bill and were willing to give @SpeakerRyan one last shot at taking food from the most vulnerable Americans." https://t.co/LUHW3zfYTYAn estimated 2 million hungry Americans will be forced off #SNAP by changes in the #GOPFarmBill.

That is unconscionable.265,000 kids will lose access to free school meals under the #GOPFarmBill.

265,000. Kids. 

Disgraceful.I am requesting them to specify what changes, if any, they will be making to ensure their users’ privacy considering the upcoming implementation of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Today, I sent letters to @Airbnb, @Fitbit, @Google, @Lyft, @Snapchat, @Twitter, and @Uber asking about their commitment to user privacy: https://t.co/SNsIhrn2jb https://t.co/KLZYpMhtuGWhy is it that instead of treatment, minorities are subject to incarceration? Even more insulting, when a crisis impacts African-American communities it’s seen as a criminal justice crisis but when it affects white communities, it’s seen as a public health crisis. #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/O2dIijiAPmHouse Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn’t kick a single person off #SNAP. That’s not true. 400,000 households will lose benefits. https://t.co/0SeORgsKtSIgnoring other addicts and addictions is an injustice.

Great food and fellowship! https://t.co/X5Ss6MZ3YwToday, it is important that we finish the work of these trailblazing women and Congressman Dyer and rewrite the wrongs of history.During this period, women were important and prominent figures. Before this legislation was introduced they already had a grassroots movement in motion. They were organizing petition drives, fundraising, and educating communities.Congressman Dyer, who was the first to introduce an anti-lynching bill in 1918, motivated them and helped galvanize a movement. His bill was intended to punish authorities that failed to prevent lynching and act as a deterrent to end the practice. Unfortunately, it did not pass.The horrific, despicable, and racist practice of lynching spawned their activism. African-American women stood at the forefront in public protest of these racially motivated, inhumane, and evil crimes.It is also important to remember the role African-American women played in the anti-lynching movement. It was black women who created the group, Anti-Lynching Crusaders, with the backing of the NAACP.The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which is the nation's first memorial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved black people, people terrorized by lynching must not be the last.My bill will also provide grants to encourage and preserve the history of the anti-lynching movement.Today, I announced my intention to introduce a bill to make Lynching a federal crime. This bill is in part symbolic but relevant. You only need to look at the events in Charlottesville to be reminded that not too long ago rallies such as those resulted in Lynchings. https://t.co/AF2KwAxVaEToday, I had the pleasure of meeting David Godin.

I still believe that Dr. King's vision for America and for the world is still the most powerful vision that we could have. #MLK50 https://t.co/0HeI2nhU6oThis rollback of the clean car standards will hurt American families — forcing them to spend more money on gas, increasing oil consumption, and boosting the pollution driving climate change.  #PollutingPruitt https://t.co/C5vymlulGqMy statement on Trump Calling for the Militarization of the Southern Border: https://t.co/Zr5rCWjQ4S https://t.co/z3N0l9OtcEMeanwhile, Scott Pruitt continues to defy his own agency experts to appease corporations and big polluters at the expense of our health. #PollutingPruitt https://t.co/iCuZHtE8mnResearch shows that low-income, minority communities are disproportionately impacted by dirty air and water. Low-income communities are more likely to be located closer to coal-fired power plants and, thus, are more likely to suffer from health issues. https://t.co/ErdbB4Cnd5This reckless decision to ignore science is Scott Pruitt’s hallmark and I wish he would base his decision on expert advice and not the lobbyists he answers to. #PollutingPruitt https://t.co/Xg4ADzfRGPMy statement on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt’s move to weaken America’s clean car standards: https://t.co/UDAKKw4ip3 https://t.co/sSxYQs4GJtWinnie Mandela leaves behind a legacy of bravery and a tireless commitment to freedom, equality, and justice.

https://t.co/sKmVawFF9HI look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues on these commonsense digital security solutions that will improve the trust of the American people who rely on these platforms.This industry’s lack of regulation has made everyone vulnerable to their data being placed in the wrong hands.  We cannot let this industry continue to police themselves.As news of yet another data breach comes to light, Americans are being shaken to their core and their trust in these companies is eroding. It is no longer enough for citizens to hope companies improve their internal actions. It must be mandated, as the DATA Act requires.The DATA Act would require the Federal Trade Commission issue regulations requiring companies that own or possess data containing personal information to establish specified and hardened security policies and procedures that would treat and protect our information.The time for strong, national data privacy and data protection rules is now and we must put them in place before it is too late. It is clear that our personal information is on the line and up for sale to the highest bidder, the most nefarious bad actor.
