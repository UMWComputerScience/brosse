Thousands of children have been separated from their parents as a result of this administration, and I will keep fighting until all have been reunited. And then I will fight to make sure it never happens again. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWhen a District Court ruled that the government’s conduct ‘shocks the conscience’ and required the reunification of families, I led 79 of my colleagues in demanding details about the administration’s plans for complying. https://t.co/hazsYcHlkkI am outraged by the callousness of this administration and called on the president to abandon his policy of separating families.Many families seeking protection at the border are fleeing horrific violence and have legitimate requests for asylum – a protection long enshrined in U.S. and international law.Oregon's economy is supported by trade. Today I toured @UnionWine and met with businesses to discuss how a trade agreement done right would grow the economy and how retaliatory #tariffs could hurt NW Oregon. https://t.co/OK8pdc2T9pThe high cost of child care forces too many low-income families to rely on patchwork care to cover parents’ work schedules.

We should be making it easier, not harder, for workers to form unions and collectively bargain.Today’s #SCOTUS decision in #JANUSvsAFSCME will hurt working families and organized labor, but unions have persevered in the face of adversity before and will again.Women need honest medical advice—not lies from fake women’s health centers.

We need a plan to reunite separated families. #KeepFamiliesTogetherWe can and must do better. #ProtectSNAP
https://t.co/xiTRCRzQ1eThe Farm Bill should have policies that benefit both hard-working farmers who produce food &amp; seniors and families in need. Unfortunately, the partisan Farm Bill we voted on again today would take food off the tables of tens of thousands of hungry Oregonians.Most people would agree it’s a good idea to have a plan for managing precious natural resources like #OurOceans. Not President Trump. He just rolled back the #NationalOceanPolicy, leaving our oceans more vulnerable to #ClimateChange and overfishing.

https://t.co/yj4ICUYarNWhen ICE agents separate children and parents, they cause trauma, pain, and heartache.

https://t.co/0zDE69gDE6Here is my account of conditions at the prison and the men’s stories of fleeing horrific violence or religious persecution, being separated from their wives and children, and not receiving medical care in prison. https://t.co/pW5sxlTQunWhat I saw &amp; heard when I visited the 123 men detained in federal prison in Sheridan shook me to the core. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThank you to @ColorCoalition for issuing the “Leading with Race” report that illustrates the breadth of our diversity and makes recommendations for how we can better fulfill our commitment to fairness and justice for everyone.

We must be better than this. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/jEI35yQYrYMost detainees I met today are seeking asylum, fleeing violent gangs or religious persecution. Few have had access to attorneys &amp; several need medical care but have not received it. They told us that they are confined in small cells for up to 23 hours a day. #EndFamilySeparationToday I visited immigrant detainees in federal prison in OR. Hearing their stories leaves me heartbroken, for them but also for our nation. Several men were separated from their children &amp; did not know where their kids were. Tearing children from families is abhorrent &amp; cruel.In 2016, there were thousands of verified claims of financial abuse in OR, and many of the victims were seniors. As a daughter helping to care for my elderly mother, I’m glad the House passed the Senior Safe Act to help financial institutions report fraud against seniors #WEAAD18It’s alarming to realize how much plastic is in our oceans. I toured the #OceanPlastics Lab with my colleague and Oceans Caucus Co-Chair from Alaska, @RepDonYoung. Together we’ve introduced the #SaveOurSeas Act to address the critical problem of marine debris. https://t.co/QePmE5fSgpIt’s the 6th anniversary of #DACA today, and long past time to give #Dreamers certainty so they can pursue their studies and careers.

I support the Workers’ Freedom to Negotiate Act because it is #ABetterDeal for workers. https://t.co/LfPwO9m8s9Only 15% of US workers have paid family leave. Too often that puts families in an economic bind. #FathersDay is a reminder that both women &amp; men need #PaidFamilyLeave. The #FAMILYAct would bring the nation’s policies in line w/ the needs of families.
https://t.co/0la4LLdjkpIt is unacceptable that Sec. @BetsyDeVosED has failed to help students defrauded by predatory for-profit colleges. Secretary DeVos must stand up for students and provide them with the full loan forgiveness they are entitled to under the law.

We must do better. I appreciate the social services and partnerships that @HomeForwardNews uses to serve their residents at places like Pearl Court Apartments. https://t.co/zfXocNeCe6The President suggested slashing or eliminating many of the programs supported by this funding bill. Congress rejected his proposals and instead listened to the people we represent to pass a long-term funding plan to keep the government open and support working families.And although this bill makes needed investments in the care and services of our #veterans, it continues to bloat defense spending beyond the actual needs of our military.I remain deeply concerned that Congress has yet to provide protections for the millions of #Dreamers who are living in fear and uncertainty. #DreamActNowThis bill makes clear that the @CDCgov can study #gunviolence as a #publichealth issue. There is still more work to do to address gun violence, and this critical research can help us identify effective solutions. #DickeyAmendment#Omnibus boosts investments for @NEAarts @NEHgov, which will improve the quality of life for many Oregonians and Americans.#Omnibus provides critical funding to battle the opioid crisis, bolster our infrastructure investments, support the mission of the EPA and NOAA, improve earthquake warnings, and support our communities through increased funding for Community Development Block Grants.After years of devastating #wildfires, this funding bill finally puts an end to the practice of fire-borrowing.Increases to #PellGrants will help more students afford college.The two-year extension of #SecureRuralSchools will strengthen public education in rural areas of our state and give more students the opportunity for success.#omnibus completely rejects @realDonaldTrump and @BetsyDeVosED' misguided education priorities, and instead provides strong support for several programs, including #MoreTitleIV well-rounded education, #CTE, #apprenticeships, and #teacher preparation programs.Increased support for #childcare programs and @NatlHeadStart will help #workingfamilies access affordable, high-quality child care.I’m pleased to see robust increases in funding for important programs that will help #workingfamilies get ahead, strengthen #PublicSchools , address #opioidscrisis, grow our economy, and protect the #environment.Although #omnibus government funding bill is not perfect, it is an example of what can be accomplished when Democrats &amp; Republicans work together. That’s what my constituents in Oregon are asking Congress to do: set aside our differences, find common ground, and get things done.In Northwest Oregon, we celebrate the mighty Columbia River, the vital Willamette, hundreds of streams, creeks, marshes, &amp; wetlands, and of course the Pacific Ocean.

She was a powerful voice for creating greater opportunities for women and a passionate supporter of the arts..@RepDerekKilmer &amp; I introduced a bill to modernize #WorkStudy and help more low-income students afford college and gain valuable work experience that will lead to good jobs after graduation. https://t.co/PWpMJ1c7ZsThere are many steps we can take to make college more affordable and accessible, including updating the Federal Work Study program.I want students in Oregon and around the country to have the same chance to succeed and to reach for a better future.I worked my way through community college and college with assistance from the Federal #WorkStudy program, and my work study jobs opened doors and created opportunities for me.But Congress must listen to the thousands of students who spoke up on #NationalWalkoutDay and pass commonsense actions like universal background checks and stopping dangerous individuals from getting guns. #NeverAgainOne month after the Parkland massacre, Congress took a modest step to stop gun violence in schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. https://t.co/gujQcSfP3MI went to public schools, my children went to public schools, and more than 50 million children in our country go to public schools. 

We should be strengthening, not privatizing, public education so every student has the opportunity to succeed. #PublicSchoolsWeek https://t.co/BIyvCAlg2ZWe must refuse to accept gun violence as normal.

But across the globe, 130 million girls don’t have access to education. I joined @onecampaign in saying #GirlsCount. https://t.co/5WIIALepVJThe Secretary of Education must be a champion for all our students – including the more than 50 million who attend public schools. Betsy DeVos’ singular focus on privatizing public education will be detrimental to the vast majority of students across the country.Thank you to everyone who came to my Beaverton and Portland town hall meetings, where several people asked about gun violence prevention. We also talked about housing, the environment, foreign aid, the Mueller investigation, addressing poverty, and more. https://t.co/0Wo3ChapauI agree with @SheriffReese and teacher Cindy Reese: arming teachers would make our classrooms more dangerous. This is not the way to make our schools safer.

https://t.co/ilHewpMM32Thank you @OregonGovBrown for your leadership on addressing the #OpioidCrisis and for sharing your insights with Congress this week. The lessons we’ve learned in Oregon can help other states better respond to the growing threat of substance abuse and opioid addiction. https://t.co/QvEhNSJ2J4On #IWD2018 and throughout #WomensHistoryMonth, we celebrate the extraordinary achievements women have made worldwide, honor those who shaped history, and reflect on centuries of progress. https://t.co/gLUxwa87tCMy #TownHall meetings start this weekend and continue through March.

Congress must quickly reauthorize these bipartisan programs. https://t.co/ptFPjaKnyS#Dreamers and their families are living in uncertainty and fear every day that Congress fails to act. Now is the time for Congress to get to work and #ProtectDreamersHistory shows that where we drill, we spill. 

That’s a risk we can’t take off the coast of Oregon.

 The Trump administration’s proposal to open 90% of U.S. waters to offshore drilling puts coastal communities, jobs, and wildlife at risk. #ProtectOurCoast #StopOffshoreDrilling https://t.co/5amcPEDH26A key step in addressing the #OpioidCrisis is making sure people can safely dispose of unneeded medications. Drug take-back boxes in pharmacies are a great way to make drug disposal easy and accessible. @ProvHealth has disposal boxes in their Metro-area pharmacies! https://t.co/HHMf1PFi6aHappy #ReadAcrossAmerica Day!

We should not be cutting SNAP benefits! #EndHungerNow https://t.co/ZqFCqX4oIFWe have known about the dangers of asbestos for decades, and many countries have banned it for good reason.

I’m supporting @davidcicilline’s legislation to reinstate the #AssaultWeaponsBan as one step in ending the gun violence epidemic. #NeverAgainWhen teachers, nurses, firefighters, &amp; other public sector workers have the right to join together and have a voice in the workplace, working conditions and benefits improve for all workers. #JanusvAFSCME is direct attack on working families. #WeRiseAs a mom &amp; policymaker I take very seriously my responsibility to keep children safe. I’m on my way back to our nation’s capital, where I will continue to demand House Republican Leadership bring up universal background checks and other bills to address gun violence. #NeverAgainThank you to @CCCPortland for hosting us and for your important work to help people recover from addiction. https://t.co/VG6vWASjnlTurning the tide on the deadly #OpioidCrisis , and new approaches. Today I heard innovative ideas about what we can do from people on the front lines of the crisis.I enjoyed visiting @Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton and meeting some of the 12,000 Oregonians who are Nike employees. Oregon’s innovative companies help our economy thrive. https://t.co/OUoGtWUs00This is outrageous. Arming teachers won’t make students safer. There is no evidence that killers target schools because they don’t allow guns. 
 
https://t.co/KAdcTipgzJHow can students focus on learning when they’re afraid that a shooter will come into their school? #NeverAgainI applaud student leaders at @SouthridgeHigh, #TualatinHighSchool, and across Oregon and the country for standing up, speaking out, and demanding action on #GunViolence. Congress must listen and act. #StudentsDemandChange #StudentsDemandAction #MarchForOurLivesToday I heard from school leaders, social workers, experts, and doctors about the importance of prevention &amp; how we can better help young people cope with and recover from addiction. As a leader on the Education Committee, I’m committed to addressing the deadly #OpioidCrisis. https://t.co/DjrPuHmLOTI stand with the students in Florida and Oregon and across the country who are 
speaking out and demanding change to end gun violence. Let's start with universal background checks. @SpeakerRyan, we need action. #enoughisenoughDreamers have worked hard to improve their lives and our communities. Congress must work just as hard to #ProtectDreamers from deportation. 
https://t.co/JNtJtOIaRXI don’t often agree with @BetsyDeVosEd, but I agree it’s time for Congress to hold hearings on the safety of our students. Congress can and must take action to stop gun violence in our schools. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/lCTxFca3R5@edworkforcedems @BobbyScott @keithellison @RepMarkTakano Workers deserve to keep the tips they earn. Tipped workers’ rely on their tips to pay for rent, childcare, healthcare, and to feed themselves and their families. We must stop a proposal to allow employers to pocket worker’s tips. #ProtectWorkersAs I mom, I can’t imagine the grief felt by family and friends in Florida. We need more than prayers. Hearings are a critical first step, but Congress can and must follow through with action. #EnoughisEnough https://t.co/R98znX9zTqWe must never accept this as normal. Members of Congress can and must get to work preventing this kind of massacre before more kids are killed. #EndGunViolenceIt’s only February, and there have already been 18 school shootings this year. I’m horrified and devastated by the news of more people murdered in a Florida school.Estuaries are a vital part of our eco-system.

https://t.co/PtQJRYVRwhTrump’s @CFPB is gutting consumer protections that have cracked down on predatory payday loans.Even though Oregon has some of the best laws in the country to address predatory payday lending, online and offshore lenders are using loopholes to get around those laws and exploit vulnerable Oregonians.Trump's budget drastically cuts almost every research program on climate change and every environmental protection program. We can’t ignore climate change.Congratulations to the @WestviewCats and @SHS_Apollos students who qualified for the @DOE_SC_NSB! Oregon is proud of you.February is #BlackHistoryMonth, so please join me in reflecting on the contributions of African-Americans to Oregon and our country. 

We must all work together toward greater equality and justice for all. https://t.co/jiBPVFSthZI believe the survivors. https://t.co/TmvuT6u7ZoThis is no way to run government. 

The short-term budget bill adds billions to an already bloated defense budget, and it does not have a commitment from Speaker Ryan to bring up a proposal to #ProtectDreamers. 
https://t.co/SuSGVdDMEPWe must recognize that addiction is a disease – not a moral failing. 

It was great to welcome @Lines_for_Life and @TuTogether to DC to hear about their work curbing substance abuse and helping young people make healthy decisions. https://t.co/zHP8YKAIlDI’m proud to fight for Dreamers like Miriam.

Congress must pass the Dream Act so Dreamers won’t be deported.It’s outrageous that @FEMA and other federal agencies have been slow to respond, and this article shows bureaucratic incompetence. #FEMA must be held accountable. Our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico need our support to rebuild their lives.
