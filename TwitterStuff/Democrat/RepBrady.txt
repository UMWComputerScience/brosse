Today’s #SCOTUS decision is a terrible mistake. Unions like @AFSCME and @NEAToday use fair share fees to bargain for all public service employees, whether or not they are part of the union. If you get the benefits of collective bargaining, you should pay your fair share.No executive order could ever reverse the psychological trauma inflicted upon these children who were stripped from their parents’ arms at the border. We must work to create immigration policy that protects families.I am appalled by the disgraceful Trump policy of ripping babies out of their mothers’ arms. Let Mike Pence know how you feel too by bringing a pair of children's shoes to the Rittenhouse Hotel tonight at 5pm for a protest.  https://t.co/A2oM7IVGUxI join @steelworkers in urging the White House to follow through with proposed changes to the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.
