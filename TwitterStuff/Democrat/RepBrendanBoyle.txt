The fact we are winning an R+11 seat should terrify the GOP. There are over 100 current GOP house seats that are closer than #PA18 #BlueWaveIsComing@adambonin 151 votes then 112. I remember both races well.For the record, this is not my campaign slogan. https://t.co/m0CVW2Uk68I love election nights. Especially when I‚Äôm not on the ballot.@bflynn1018 @SenWarren @SenBooker @SenFeinstein @SenToomey @SenSanders @BetsyDeVosED @SenSchumer @SenJohnMcCain @RepAdamSchiff As one who is still paying off tens of thousands in student loans 20 years after graduating, I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I cosponsor a bill to allow folks in repayment to refinance at a much lower rate. Would save billions for those repaying their loans.He was right. It triggered a response. Trump fired him. 
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to have a POTUS who stood up to Putin‚Äôs aggression? https://t.co/jGKpnqqyTY@AlexGangitano Rooting for the Big 5 teams in it (Nova &amp; Penn) and my wife‚Äôs alma mater UVAI endorse this https://t.co/SYdZXAwgKcThat‚Äôs nice but can we instead just get President Bartlet in the real White House and not the reality tv star we have now? @JoshMalina @WestWingWeekly https://t.co/10Bf0bnsc1Happy #InternationalWomensDay 
Today is the perfect day to commit to measures like equal pay for equal work, access to top positions in business, and protection from abuse. Let‚Äôs recommit to this effort, today and every day.We need to do this in PA! https://t.co/G6d8bUAP8D@jamberstone1 @keithellison @RepBrady @RepDwightEvans I‚Äôm already a proud co-sponsorHere we are a couple weeks after yet another mass shooting in America and yet again the GOP Congress has refused to do anything to prevent the next mass shooting. Their inaction is dangerous. 
#schoolshootingI just wish Sam Numberg would come out of his shell and finally open up.FAKE NEWS https://t.co/Zq2iRc93qLThis is chilling https://t.co/mTzPScTtTYIt still amazes me we have a president of the United States who won‚Äôt stand up for us against Russia. Never in a million years did I think this would happen. https://t.co/Uw7eR0QucsNow you‚Äôre learning! @JohnFetterman https://t.co/oxtiea92mZWhen you combine the ingenuity of the American people with the passion of Eagles fans you get . . . https://t.co/R5Mve05d4sThis one is easy: YES! https://t.co/N54g0vaHRvGreat interview of @SarahEMcBride on NPR‚Äôs @nprfreshair 
Sarah is an important leader in the fight for achieving true equality for all. @HRCWhile certainly you can‚Äôt go wrong naming anything after MLK, I always thought West River Drive should‚Äôve been named for #MarianAnderson - a Philadelphia icon whose importance to our country can‚Äôt be overstated. @CouncilmanDerek https://t.co/QF52uF8pvoBut wouldn‚Äôt your bone spurs get in the way @realDonaldTrump ? https://t.co/Q6ulrFSElBI‚Äôm fortunate both my parents were in labor unions (@AFSCME &amp; @transportworker). The middle class would not exist in America without unions. Today at the Supreme Court the future of unions is on the line. I stand with organized labor. #Janus @AFLCIO @SEIUSomeone please tell me this is some sick joke. https://t.co/OuoMrLuYI3@SheilaShowPHL @PhillyCityRep @theheartofsport @FamousPixs @PhillylovesWHC @SmallBizPhilly @NinaScim @AndreFDelValle @SMurp3131 @TrafficGuyBry @denisefennell Happy Birthday Sheila!@StuffJudeSays Thank you Jude. I‚Äôm glad you are becoming politically active. As for guns, during my entire career I have supported common sense measures such as universal background checks, having to report a gun lost or stolen, and reinstating the assault weapons ban.@JamesJStal Agreed and I am. I refer you to my legislative twitter @CongBoyle for a recent tweet that lists some other bills I co-sponsor on this important topic.Few things in my life have inspired me more than these HS students. https://t.co/SJAUHsQ1oBI am proud to be running for re-election to represent #Philadelphia in Congress because I will never stop fighting for our working families and against @realDonaldTrump and his Republican cronies. https://t.co/8Ix8I1GzGvOn this topic, like so many others, President Obama was right. https://t.co/QqABSHOKW8Yet another sad commentary on this administration https://t.co/fLLRQ6BEVuThank you Michael https://t.co/UlijPSXVojNew data out today. Income inequality reaches an all-time high in America. So of course the GOP‚Äôs solution is a tax cut for the richest 1%.@RandyLoBasso A fair point Randy. Sometimes we are penalized by being responsible (the debt ceiling debate being a prime example).This whole map saga is revealing about both parties. When R‚Äôs have the power, they draw the most gerrymandered map in the nation (13-5). When D‚Äôs have power they draw a fair map (9-9) instead of drawing a Dem gerrymander. https://t.co/CalL6jo8tlMy colleague @RoKhanna is 100% correct. There are many communities beyond Flint suffering from unsafe water, including my own. Thanks Ro for bringing awareness to this issue. https://t.co/6U6KeurtvJRussia attacked the United States. 
Russia is planning to attack us again. 
When are we going to fight back?Congrats to all running the  #frostbite5miler in Ambler today!@CFMcElwee @michaelbd @amconmag This is excellent. Have just ordered the book.@DePasqualePA The NCAA has become a complete joke. Ban players from a great cause like THON but look the other way on North Carolina‚Äôs massive cheating.This is excellent. Pls read and RT. 
And if you don‚Äôt want to keep replaying this script the only solution is to vote out every politician who won‚Äôt vote for changing our gun laws. https://t.co/i7NIrTc3RGHmmm I wonder if there‚Äôs somehow a connection?  No there couldn‚Äôt possibly be. Right @GOP ??? https://t.co/WewzlNTVjw@timmyers811 I voted against HR 620 - The Weaken The ADA Act (thought I would help my GOP friends with a more accurate title for the bill)For those who say ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt the time &amp; place‚Äù to talk about changing our gun laws, could you let me know when exactly is the time &amp; place? Is it after the next mass shooting? After the next 5? 10?One of the first issues I worked on as an elected official was domestic violence. It continues to be a passion for me. Most people have no idea how many obstacles are placed in the way of victims. I applaud this survivor for coming forward. It‚Äôs not easy. https://t.co/LzFcTFiqtDSorry @StephenAtHome I‚Äôm currently undecided on how to vote when it comes to letting you read your own memo. Feel free to come by my office and convince me. https://t.co/25bXJXX51YRemember when candidate Trump said he would never cut Social Security and Medicare? 
Yesterday President Trump unveiled his budget that cuts $554 billion from Medicare.Sorry to learn of the passing of a predecessor, US Rep Jon Fox. Jon held PA-13 for a couple terms in the 1990s. He was a nice man who cared deeply about our community. I will miss him as will others in Montco.This is great news. No reason why this shouldn‚Äôt be the law everywhere. https://t.co/1dE2Nwh2QZA friendly reminder to certain media outlets fawning over North Korea‚Äôs participation in these games that their regime is a brutal dictatorship that starves its own people and threatens nuclear war.The Far Right so dominates talk radio it‚Äôs nice to have a show out there fighting back for working people.

NO 

A military parade that honors our troops and remembers the sacrifices of our veterans?
YES

The former is a disturbing prospect for our democracy. The latter is a good idea and one I support.@wdr1 Gotta love technology. My apologies. Can you please send me your email address.@edatpost @pkcapitol @costareports For the record this is not me in this pictureWhen I first saw ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù I just assumed Trump was sending me birthday wishes.

My Dad is an immigrant and he is the hardest working person I know. Woke up at 4:30am to clean subway stations. I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am without his work ethic.@PhillyTurtleGuy @kenvogel Nope the credit is all Bob‚Äôs - and of course the Eagles!My friend @RepMikeCapuano is looking much better these days https://t.co/3RjOJnTQfpGlad that GOP leadership in the House has agreed to schedule a vote on my bipartisan bill to help Ukraine defend its cybersecurity against Russian attacks.

#SuperBowlLII 
#SuperBowlChampionsNot sure my heart will survive the final 2 minutes. #FlyEaglesFlyCris Collinsworth can never be allowed to call a game again. It‚Äôs a catch and a TD. 
#FlyEaglesFlyThe best defense would be milking this clock down to as close to zero as possible. Get the last score and you don‚Äôt have to worry about the defense stopping Brady.@dickius It‚Äôs under active considerationKudos to @kasie for wearing her Eagles colors proudly! https://t.co/fpBCikFbwhIt‚Äôs a catch. Just stop Cris Collinsworth.Our QB can catch better than your QB
