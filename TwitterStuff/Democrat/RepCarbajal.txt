On the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, we are reminded that the fight for equal rights protections for the LGBTQ community is not over. As an @LGBTEqCaucus member, I’m working to pass the #EqualityAct to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. https://t.co/ccEK7nBadCGlad to see beach wheelchairs will now be available for members of our community. A great resource that makes our beautiful beaches more accessible to everyone! https://t.co/chON1A550jCongratulations to this year's #CongressionalArtCompetition winner, Madison Ly from Santa Maria! Her artwork “The American Dream” is inspired by the past &amp; future generations of immigrants in search of greater opportunities for their families. https://t.co/NpFjDCnQi1My father was a proud member of the @steelworkers and @ufwupdates unions &amp; he taught me the pivotal role unions play in protecting workers. Today’s decision forces unions to do more with less, and limits their ability to negotiate for decent pay and fair workplace practices. https://t.co/0lGRATGmcFIt was heartbreaking to see the impact of @POTUS’s cruel ‘zero tolerance’ policy on children &amp; parents during my visit to a detention center. 

We need answers about how families will be reunited &amp; Congress must pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to ensure it never happens again. https://t.co/Mc4QVTdqHnEvery woman deserves information about &amp; access to the full range of reproductive care options. Today’s misguided #SCOTUS decision sadly gives unlicensed facilities the ability to mislead women about their reproductive health care. https://t.co/7PdyOIgS09I immigrated to the US as a young boy, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have served this county - both as a Marine &amp; as a Member of Congress. Proud to join my immigrant colleagues in the #NewAmericansCaucus to celebrate #ImmigrantHeritageMonth https://t.co/4VvfBX3KFZ#NetNeutrality enables entrepreneurs to start and grow their small businesses online. We need to #SaveNetNeutrality to prevent small businesses from getting priced out of the online marketplace. https://t.co/zO7Ljtno30From employment to housing opportunities, the #LGBTQ community still faces discrimination in key areas of life. Congress must pass the bipartisan #EqualityAct to provide clear, consistent non-discrimination protections. #EqualityForward https://t.co/lPX3GwPxZRTargeting people based on their nationality or religion undermines our nation's values and puts Americans at risk by emboldening our adversaries. Disappointed by today’s decision &amp; I will continue fighting against discriminatory and hateful immigration policies. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/5UU7oRJkwxDiverting resources away from prosecuting gang and drug offenses in order to prosecute asylum-seekers is deeply misguided. Joined advocates from @ElPasoDMRS to learn about the conditions in Central America causing families to seek asylum in the US. https://t.co/x52DtYSR3yI crossed the border this morning into Ciudad Juarez in Mexico to see what the families seeking asylum undergo when being processed and entering into the United States. I was also able to see the border wall separating the US and Mexico in south El Paso. https://t.co/De4MAdAk9TVisiting the Tornillo detention facility in Texas today to see firsthand the impact that @POTUS’s policy is having on children in detention &amp; their parents.

From her work at @PPFA of the Central Coast to the hours she's spent training youth leaders, her efforts to improve the lives of children, women &amp; immigrants in our community are immeasurable https://t.co/qwyL7IfAEzGreat meeting with students from Paso Robles &amp; Arroyo Grande in Washington DC last week! So encouraged by these future leaders and their willingness to be active and informed participants in our democracy. https://t.co/N5p6XDL1ikBetween transportation shortfalls &amp; an outdated phone system, our veterans face far too many challenges to accessing healthcare.

I’m thankful that my amendments, which provide $8 mil in funding to VA transportation &amp; $5 mil to revamp the phone systems, were passed by the House.Kris was laid off a few months ago but, thanks to the ACA, she could not be denied insurance coverage while unemployed.   
 
We must work to improve the ACA and bring down premiums and prescription drug costs, not sabotage it and abandon people like Kris. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/qZ97kRKMlTMany Central Coast farmers, including Rick in Carpinteria, have told me repeatedly that the labor shortage is costing them. 

Our current broken immigration policy hurts the agricultural industry, which relies on having a steady, legal immigrant workforce. https://t.co/HDcit7nX6aThe budget is a statement of our values, and I'm disappointed by its unbalanced approach to homeland security. The #GOPBudget funds an expensive border wall, but ignores immigration reform, DACA recipients, &amp; the ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy cruelly detaining families. https://t.co/neqfKQuJS4At a time when asylum-seeking families are being ripped apart, we must work to  #KeepFamiliesTogether and reaffirm our commitment to supporting the world's most vulnerable refugees. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/2MHTzHNOpZThe #NationalOceanPolicy was the first comprehensive plan for conserving &amp; managing our ocean resources.

Disappointed in @POTUS's shortsighted decision to revoke it &amp; implement policy that lacks a strong commitment to sustainable water use, as drought conditions persist in CA.Joined @RepJerryNadler &amp; over 190 House Democrats today to introduce the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, which prevents family separation, limits criminal prosecutions for asylum seekers &amp; increases child welfare training for DHS agents.

Read more: https://t.co/cclmExolXiThe President’s cruel and unnecessary policy of separating children from their parents when they enter the US isn’t about border protection – it’s about intimidation &amp; fear. We should all be outraged by these inhumane actions and speak out against them. #FamiliesBelongTogether6 yrs ago President Obama announced the #DACA program, allowing 700k immigrants who arrived as children to contribute to our communities &amp; economy. 

Today, I’m standing w/ Greisa, a DACA recipient, to demand that Congress act on a bipartisan solution to codify its protections. https://t.co/tq2Zu3BzxYHappy #FlagDay! Today we celebrate our nation’s flag, and the American values that it honors.

From ag to infrastructure, our Districts have a lot in common. Thanks for having me in NE, I'm looking forward to your visit to #CA24! https://t.co/GLJFGcyA8GAttorney General Session's decision undermines the basic principles of our immigration laws, which have ensured that asylum-seekers w/ credible fear of violence can present their case in court. Especially cruel to disqualify domestic violence victims from seeking asylum in US. https://t.co/zSBbmT0AxCToday, the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect, but the fight for a free and open internet continues. The Senate has already voted to #SaveTheInternet. I'm proud to support similar legislation here in the House. https://t.co/Zv480lp6lyThis week is the 112th anniversary of the #AntiquitiesAct, which has helped to preserve some of America's landmarks, including our very own Carrizo Plain National Monument, so future generations can enjoy them.

Within a couple of months of her contacting my office, staff was able to resolve the issue and return over $30,000 to her. https://t.co/4vHXH3wDx9One of the most important parts of my work representing the Central Coast, is making sure our community has support when dealing with a federal agency. In my first term, my office returned over $2 mil to Central Coast residents. See how we can serve you: https://t.co/a4M5fWjMwbRather than continuing our unsustainable fossil fuel reliance, we must incentivize clean energy business growth that benefits public health &amp; economy. I support transitioning to 100% clean energy because our children deserve to live in pollution-free communities. https://t.co/9SZYovBQAjAs an elected official, infrastructure has always been one of my top priorities. I wrote to Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi urging them to pass a comprehensive, long-term infrastructure investment bill that would solve the infrastructure needs of American communities. https://t.co/oYxl3BiwbCI’m a proud immigrant, the son of a farmworker &amp; humbled by the opportunity to serve the #CentralCoast in Congress.

https://t.co/tNvhw3GrQHThe traditionally bipartisan #FarmBill has always balanced the priorities of our farmers w/ support for essential food &amp; nutrition programs. Sadly, this year’s bill shirked bipartisanship by drastically cutting the SNAP program, which serves thousands of Central Coast families.After the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the Well Control Rule was enacted as a critical safety measure meant to save lives and protect our coasts.

They shouldn't live in fear of being shot in their classrooms. #EnoughIsEnoughWhen I visited a Head Start class in San Luis Obispo, I saw firsthand the pivotal role this program plays in making sure our children have a comprehensive childhood education. Today marks 53 years since the program began. Happy birthday, #HeadStart! https://t.co/EHM0oisQqeI met with local and regional farmers yesterday to discuss their priorities in Congress, including this year’s #FarmBill.

Instead, they are enriching themselves with stock buybacks and leaving American workers behind. https://t.co/JJ2QPLNqqFThis #TaxDay let’s remember who really benefits from the #GOPTaxPlan. 

✔️ multinational corporations using tax breaks to enrich themselves, not raising wages for employees

These impressive students are well-informed and engaged. I'm confident that there are many future leaders in the group. Safe travels back to the Central Coast! https://t.co/XQA0NramE3When the perpetrator of the #Parkland Shooting displayed warning signs, the legal options for police weren’t enough to disarm a dangerous individual. @RepDonBeyer @RepEsty &amp; I's #GVRO Act is a practical, bipartisan bill which could have saved those lives. https://t.co/gH34vsfnfRDuring the #ThomasFire &amp; Montecito mudslides, as residents evacuated their homes, our brave firefighters ran toward the disaster without a 2nd thought.

Gun Violence Restraining Orders do just that, disarming individuals in crisis while maintaining due process.I’m glad to see the President and @VP express their support for the #GVRO Act, now we need Congress to take action to pass my bill, H.R. 2598. https://t.co/mvoqcHuiDVSBA representatives will be available to answer questions and assist residents with disaster loans.

I introduced the #GVRO Act to give law enforcement the tools to do just that. This bill can saves lives. #EnoughIsEnough #NeverAgain https://t.co/ttEAAC9JeIConnecticut, California, Indiana, Washington, and Oregon have all adopted variations of this legislation. They are saving lives without violating gun owners’ due process rights, and I believe we should expand them nationwide by passing the #GVRO Act. https://t.co/SieLm5z5gb“I became a special agent because I wanted to prevent crimes from happening in the first place. That is what this bill helps us do. This is a good investment in this country’s safety and future.” – David Chipman, @GiffordCourage Sr Policy Advisor #GVRO https://t.co/EwoKAQwWBK“This is a measure that has bipartisan support and its long overdue that this bill is taken up for a vote. By doing that, we can make our communities safer.” @RepThompson #GVRO https://t.co/sd5wVK3Ehp“We train people to recognize warning signs and then take steps to prevent the tragedy before it happens. The #GVRO is one of those next steps. I applaud this legislation that pushes our states to act.” - Mark Barden, @SandyHook #GVRO https://t.co/zNCqPIo8E9“Those kids look at us and say ‘why haven’t you done anything?’ And this shows them that we can act, we can lead, and we can take America forward on this crucial issue.” – @RepBeyer #GVRO https://t.co/L9VVGRfSKC“Everyone knew this was a person was a danger to the community. These crimes could be avoided if we passed a #GVRO Act. The NRA says again and again that we want to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those in crisis. This bill does just that.” - @RepBeyer #GVRO https://t.co/YYzPszwJQY“The time has long past. We need to act, we need to act now. The children from #Parkland are calling this country to account. They will be our leaders and it’s time for leaders in Congress to step up.” – @RepEsty #GVRO https://t.co/qACgglk1bX“Protecting the 2nd amendment and keeping our communities safe are not mutually exclusive. We have no higher calling thank to protect our kids. Let’s not let them down.” - @RepFitzpatrick  #GVRO https://t.co/BAtyTK2GOaMany of our speakers, including myself, were personally affected by gun violence. I lost my sister to suicide. #GVRO laws are a tool for law enforcement to temporarily separate those in crisis from guns, while ensuring due process. This bill can save lives. https://t.co/O8y8x3BMawThank you to my colleagues @repesty, @repdonbeyer, @repthompson, @repbrianfitz, @repteddeutch and to @sandyhook, @giffordscourage, &amp; @CSGV for joining me today and for your strong advocacy in moving forward #GVRO Act, sensible legislation that helps prevents gun violence.The #GVRO Act is bipartisan &amp; effective piece of gun safety legislation. WATCH our press event live: https://t.co/G3fZaka4p2The Gun Violence Restraining Order is bipartisan legislation that has been proven to work in the states that have adopted it. I’m holding a press conference on my bill to incentivize states to implement #GVRO laws nationwide. Tune in TODAY at 1pm PT/4pm ET to watch live!Combating the effect of climate change and preserving our natural resources for future generations is a guiding principle of my voting record. I’m proud to have earned a perfect score on the 2017 #LCVScorecard and will continue fighting to preserve environmental protections.Abolishing #NetNeutrality protections puts the interests of corporations over individuals.

Check the map to see if your area is under notice and prepare for the possibility of evacuation. https://t.co/KLgnIN8ZM9Connecticut, California, Indiana, Washington, and Oregon have all adopted variations of this legislation. They are saving lives without violating gun owners’ due process rights, and I believe we should expand them nationwide by passing the #GVRO Act. https://t.co/TiaFeiAMT1If we had a federal #GVRO, the 17 students and teachers in Parkland might still be alive. We must empower law enforcement and loved ones to prevent gun violence before it occurs. This was an avoidable tragedy. https://t.co/QvYOpod74eDespite broad public support and proof that Gun Violence Restraining Orders work, there is not a single Republican co-signer on the #GVROAct. Preventing gun violence should not be a partisan issue. Congressional inaction is costing lives.

@NRA = #NoRepublicanAction https://t.co/TThmEOw1pe9 out of 10 suicides that involve a firearm end in death. For individuals in crisis, including my sister, a #GVRO would temporarily remove weapons from their possession and could have meant the difference between taking her own life and seeking help. https://t.co/MuQIVaeShVThanks to the students at Taylor Elementary for the warm welcome and the insightful questions. I see lots of future leaders for the Central Coast in those classrooms! https://t.co/afYbbS7ekBThe families of the Parkland victims deserve more than just thoughts &amp; prayers, they deserve action. My bill, the #GVROAct incentivizes states to give law enforcement the tools to stop the next school shooting before it happens. #StudentsDemandAction
 
https://t.co/jg2YjylMUbUnderstanding the barriers to higher education that students face begins with hearing the stories of students from all backgrounds.

This is not the time for complacency, it’s time for action. https://t.co/U09WVYQnYvEvery year, thousands of Monarch Butterflies migrate to Pismo Beach and land in one of our butterfly groves. The Central Coast knows that #Funding4Wildlife is essential &amp; I’m proud to be a co-sponsor of the Wildlife Restoration Act! https://t.co/bja41mizqcShameful for Congressmembers to refuse to hold any hearings to address the gun violence epidemic. Laws like #GVROAct could have helped prevent Parkland Shooting &amp; similar legislation is already working in states like CA. Unfortunately NRA also stands for No Republican Action. https://t.co/lCj1olG6n5Yesterday, I met w/ the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus to discuss investing in energy efficiency. Meanwhile, Trump's #DirtyBudget cuts $2bil in funding for renewable energy programs &amp; instead prioritizes kickbacks to the oil &amp; gas industry. The Central Coast deserves better. https://t.co/nVaantjS0ZThe Department of Homeland Security is processing DACA renewals for newly or nearly expired work authorizations. A free workshop will be held tomorrow from 12-5pm at 51 Zaca Ln, Ste 100 in SLO to assist anyone eligible to renew. https://t.co/caUo28SsQ2For those who keep repeating after each mass shooting that it is “too soon” to discuss meaningful gun violence reform, please consider that for many families – including my own – it is far too late. #GunReformNowI lost my older sister to suicide w/ a firearm at a young age. What I’ve learned since, is that temporarily preventing people from having a gun while in a state of crisis saves lives. #GunReformNowWhile the troubling details of the shooting in Florida are still emerging, it is clear this horrific act of violence was perpetrated by an individual in crisis. That’s why @RepEsty, @RepBeyer, and I are working hard to pass a #GVRO bill in Congress. #GunReformNowI agree, it's heartbreaking that signs this individual meant to inflict harm on his community were not addressed. That’s why we must pass the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act, to give families and law enforcement the ability to temporarily remove guns from individuals in crisis https://t.co/yw3AcuGoNwCuts to infrastructure funding hits CA especially hard but @POTUS's budget eliminates TIGER grant funding. Releasing an infrastructure plan to fix our “crumbling infrastructure” with a budget that makes funding development more difficult fails to meet the needs of Californians. https://t.co/zvPt2PQ8wOThis past October, I wrote to @USDOT to support Santa Barbara &amp; San Luis Obispo’s bids for TIGER grants to improve our transportation infrastructure, including improvements to Highways 101 &amp; 46, which facilitates both the tourism and agriculture sectors on the Central Coast.My heart goes out to those affected by the school shooting in #Florida today. We are once again reminded that we have a responsibility to act in Congress to change things. We owe these families more than just our thoughts and prayers.31 years ago today I married my Valentine. Happy anniversary and Happy Valentine’s Day to my wife Gina. https://t.co/KkQ50zZTqoI’ll be questioning @mickmulvaneyomb about how the #TrumpBudget hurts working families on the Central Coast. Tune in to watch!  https://t.co/pRnN0CL8HPOver 40 million Californians face food insecurity and the disasters in our district make this problem even more difficult to overcome. Instead of funding programs that help put fresh and healthy food on the table, the #TrumpBudget moves us backwards by targeting the SNAP program.The food box delivery program @POTUS proposes is far from a “Blue Apron type program” – it is a gigantic leap backwards &amp; robs Americans of being able to make choices for their own families. https://t.co/6AKdow605xInstead of putting working families first, the #TrumpBudget guts Medicaid &amp; Social Security. @POTUS's plan slashes funding for SNAP, but provides $18bil in funding for a border wall, reflecting this Administration’s misguided priorities. https://t.co/M0o3i7cbbhFive yrs ago, we saw how dangerous silencers can be when four people, including police officers, lost their lives in a 10-day shooting spree. The #SHAREAct, which allows individuals w/ history of violent crime to buy silencers, is a large step backward in preventing gun violence.$200bil to rebuild our infrastructure falls dramatically short of the $1.5 trillion he promised and places the burden on already cash-strapped local governments while gutting the environmental protections that keeps the Central Coast’s environment healthy and safe in the process.The President’s #infrastructure plan calls for “streamlining” the permit review process despite a @USTreasury report finding that the main factor that slowed down 39 out of 40 projects was a lack of federal funding, not environmental reviews and the permitting process.Honored to speak at the Annual Awards Dinner recognizing SLO County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue. The heroes being honored last night volunteered to help neighbors in Montecito after the mudslides. I’m thankful for our district’s unity as we recover from the mudslides. #805strong https://t.co/yq6RYPB7gjAt a time when the #MeToo movement has given victims of abuse the courage to come forward without the fear of being ignored, it is shameful that @POTUS would praise someone with a history of domestic violence without acknowledging or offering any sympathy to Rob Porter's victims. https://t.co/RhVW1XIEKvI joined democratic colleagues &amp; my friends across the aisle in the Problem Solvers Caucus urging @SpeakerRyan to take immigration reform seriously &amp; put one of the many bipartisan immigration bills that would protect Dreamers up for a vote. #GiveUsAVote
