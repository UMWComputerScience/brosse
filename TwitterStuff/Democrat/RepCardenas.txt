Republicans want right-to-work nationwide, a race to the bottom. Right now with Janus, they are celebrating their latest attack on the labor movement and working people everywhere. We must allow unions to continue to be a driving force in our nation’s prosperity.The judge ordered all families to be reunited within 30 days.

While Republicans control the presidency and both chambers of Congress,  the courts have reminded Republicans that separating babies and keeping them in cages is against the law.A ray of light during this dark time, as Trump continues to separate babies from their mothers on American soil: A George W. Bush-appointed federal judge has ordered that border authorities stop this cruel practice.Today, I submitted a letter signed by 70 of my fellow members expressing concern about Donald Trump’s cruel family separation policy and demanding more information on how these children are cared for: https://t.co/wAlH2DCPx1Donald Trump’s travel ban is an attack on all Americans’ constitutional rights. My statement on the Supreme Court’s decision: https://t.co/aEtKhQj4E5This is all you need to know about Trump and his cronies’ response to the humanitarian crisis at the border. https://t.co/PiHsM0l2gQAs soon as a child is separated from his family, the United States becomes his legal guardian. So these are our kids, whether you like it or not. https://t.co/OmOWAyT9ZUActions speak louder than words.  Don’t let them fool you.Meanwhile my colleagues in the Democratic Party have been pushing for solutions. The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct solves family separation at the border. And unlike what Donald Trump and his cronies want, this bill focuses on the health and well-being of all the children.The executive order and these bills DO NOTHING to reunite families that have been torn apart.  Parents still don’t know where their babies are.These bills that Republicans are offering do nothing to help DREAMERS, even though they know losing Dreamers would cost America $433 billion in GDP over the next decade.First off, Trump’s executive order does NOTHING to stop the detention and separation of families. It’s so full of loopholes and it was written in bad faith. Thankfully, the American people are too smart to trust the empty promises of a known liar and fraud.Can you imagine being torn apart from your parents at the border, then sent with complete strangers more than a thousand miles away? Trump’s executive order is meaningless. Don’t be fooled!

https://t.co/8PCaZeVeKQThis is what happens when a company has too much control in an industry. We can't let Sinclair get even bigger and force their content on our trusted local news stations. https://t.co/tu8PsT47WjI just read Trump's executive order. Don't be fooled, because it accomplishes nothing. This isn't over, Donald Trump.Today, I toured detention facilities in San Diego with my fellow Members. My longer statement is here. My shorter statement is #KeepFamiliesTogether. https://t.co/LeC6gHjAEiThis administration may forget, but we still live in America. Our country was founded on the principle of due process and Mr. Garcia deserves a fair hearing.My office has been in contact with Mr. Garcia’s family, local advocates and Federal officials. We are gathering information about his case and urging the Department of Homeland Security and ICE to treat him fairly.Last week, ICE agents ripped him from his family while he was having his morning coffee, while his daughter watched in horror. He may be locked in a detention center for months, or even years, before he will have his day in court even though he is not a threat to anyone.Jose Luis Garcia is a father and a grandfather. He attended Van Nuys High School and grew up in Glendale. He is a member of our community, and he has spent the last five decades in this country.

https://t.co/leTAfy4lzADonald Trump could put a stop to this. He just doesn’t want to. He wants families to be torn apart. He wants you and your neighbors to be afraid. For him, that is the point. https://t.co/lb1ziMIrduThere is a human rights emergency at the border. I stand with my colleagues in the People’s House – we must stop this policy NOW: https://t.co/8Re35ANLpmIt would be irresponsible for Pai to push through this merger before its legality is considered. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. https://t.co/ag6KKazNYmToday, I am sending a letter co-led by @RepAnnaEshoo calling on FCC Chairman Pai to wait on the courts before the FCC acts on the Sinclair merger. Right now, the D.C. Circuit Court is about to decide a case that could make the merger illegal. https://t.co/Iy4K0OSQeNWe only need the courage of a few more lawmakers to sign. I urge my colleagues who have not yet signed the discharge petition to do so – the American people are counting on us.I signed the discharge petition because we must protect DREAMers and secure America’s economic future. I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have worked together to craft these pieces of legislation and to now bring these bills to the floor for a proper debate.A thread on Sinclair, the city of Los Angeles and the future of local news. https://t.co/uyzIrSYmnsWhat he said. https://t.co/C00dJbLkoVThank you @RepMikeQuigley for your pointed questioning of Chairman Pai on the sham of a merger that is Sinclair-Tribune.Scott Pruitt has stopped enforcement on America’s biggest polluters and has used taxpayer dollars on frivolous expenses that exceed the salaries of tax-paying police officers, teachers and other public servants.Scott Pruitt is failing the American people with his inability to be ethical and his unwillingness to protect the health and welfare of the most vulnerable.His visit is an opportunity to reflect on the importance of America’s leading role as a member of the international community. What we need now more than anything is true leadership on the world stage.At a time of rising nationalist sentiment, President Macron is a champion for democracy, peace and security in Europe and in the world. His visit is an opportunity to reflect on the importance of America’s leading role as a member of the international community.Last week, I joined 101 of my colleagues in Congress to urge @realDonaldTrump to properly commemorate the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. We are still waiting. https://t.co/k9MEvit1bjWhile it is important to honor the memory of these victims, we must also strive to prevent atrocities like this one from happening again in the future.The Greater Los Angeles area is home to the largest Armenian diaspora community in the United States. I stand with the community to remember the 1.5 million lives lost in the Armenian Genocide 103 years ago today.This court case should be allowed to run its course. Pai should not try to push the Sinclair-Tribune merger through when it could be unlawful just a couple months from now. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. We must act NOW. #StopSinclair https://t.co/mBRBlcMEOgKTLA has been a pillar of local news for decades. LA will suffer if alt-right messages from corporate are beamed into every household, replacing real local news &amp; local, trusted anchors. This merger must be stopped, for LA and for our country.Here in Los Angeles, KTLA will become a Sinclair station soon if Sinclair gets what it wants. Watch LA in these maps. https://t.co/X142zH0JZbWhat really matters: the Sinclair merger will hurt local communities, diversity, &amp; local journalism. Ex: KOMO journalists in Seattle are forced to read scripts handed down from corporate &amp; can’t quit bc Sinclair locked them into horrible contracts. https://t.co/ow9VdvX7D2Everyone wants to focus on the CONTENT with Sinclair and the content is scary. But not nearly as scary as the reach &amp; power they’d have to squash all competition and turn YOUR local news into one-size-fits-all national reports, like cable news.Sinclair is happening now and we must do everything we can to sound the alarm and stop their plans of expanding to reach 72% of America https://t.co/NoOAdBLFvhBasically, Chairman Pai added a rule that will make Sinclair’s passage possible, and @freepress is challenging them in court. The judges seem skeptical of this rule and Pai’s reasoning.  The news was so bad for Sinclair that stock prices actually dropped https://t.co/mBRBlcMEOgBut a little known court case on Friday could stop the whole thing: https://t.co/mBRBlcMEOgThe news spread and Sinclair yielded support from @realDonaldTrump (of course). Since then, we haven’t heard much.Sinclair was forced into the national spotlight when @Deadspin’s @bubbaprog made a video splicing up different anchors saying the same anti-fake news message ...Expanding the definition of “public charge” to discriminate &amp; hurt immigrant families runs counter to American ideals. Immigrants built this country. The DHS under Trump is blind to this truth that was self-evident to the founders of this nation. https://t.co/l8wNBZSlWUBOOM.

We must keep our planet clean—it’s the only home we have. #EarthDay"What better way to celebrate our beautiful planet on #EarthDay, the only home we have, with a visit to one of our national parks?" https://t.co/IWpjhpQW0KTrump wants to keep families apart by expanding the definition of “public charge” to include programs related to health, well-being, &amp; education of immigrants. This only serves to segregate immigrant communities &amp; perpetuate poverty. https://t.co/7ne30Zjy4qInstead of letting working folks take an extra work shift or continue looking for a job, they would need to participate in under-funded job training programs to continue to qualify for SNAP #protectSNAPSNAP helps lift people out of poverty and homelessness, the Republican proposals to SNAP are counterproductive to this effort and could push working families into deeper poverty.Additional work requirements in SNAP are nothing more than artificial barriers that would leave more people hungry and in poverty – the vast majority of SNAP recipients live in a working household.In California, nearly half of all SNAP participants are in WORKING families that are struggling to put food on the table.#ProtectSNAPDonald Trump is missing a communications director. Maybe Sinclair Media should step in and do want to step in and do that job, too?My sincerest condolences to President George H.W. Bush, President George W. Bush and the entire Bush family for their loss.

This is truly disturbing. https://t.co/IdtxywMj09Sí, se puede!I am honored to recognize the work of Chávez in this Congress. I hope we all can reflect this weekend on what we can do to create a better world.When my father arrived in this country, he was a farm worker. Chávez fought for farm workers all his life. He believed in respect and dignity for all people. He dedicated his life to positive change through non-violence so that all families could achieve the American dream.The very first piece of legislation I introduced in the U.S. Congress was a resolution honoring Cesár Chavéz.For everyone celebrating Passover this evening, Chag Sameach!I fully support the @AGBecerra California lawsuit and urge the President to allow a full count of our nation.Make no mistake, Trump and his anti-immigrant administration wants to punish communities with significant minority populations and scare them into not filling out the Census.The inclusion of the citizenship question in the Census is an attack on California and our vibrant communities.I want to commend all the San Fernando Valley participants in the nationwide school walk out, and everyone traveling to Washington to march this weekend. Your bravery knows no bounds. #NeverAgainI’m determined to do everything I can to protect our democracy, American families, seniors and our veterans. This bill fails to do that. And that’s why I voted no.Several people have already pleaded guilty, and even President Trump’s campaign chair has been indicted on 32 counts of fraud and money laundering. President Trump wants to fire Mueller, so we have to do everything we can to ensure he is able to complete his investigation.I voted NO because Vladimir Putin interfered in our country’s presidential election, and this bill does nothing to protect Robert Mueller so he can get to the bottom of it.I voted no because the bill sets our country back by $400 billion, denying American citizens jobs and higher wages, all by failing to secure a place for Dreamers.I voted 'NO' because this bill spends $1.6 billion of American taxpayer money for a border wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for.I voted 'NO' because there is nothing in this bill to fix healthcare for the American people.I voted 'NO' on the omnibus bill, and let me tell you why.With your sudden enthusiasm for Cesar Chavez and his passion for the dignity of immigrant labor, I look forward to your support on Dreamers. https://t.co/ZETYIyCmThA great introduction to Nowruz, the Persian New Year: https://t.co/7K7t6f7tLOReminder: Please listen to first responders if any evacuations are ordered.

While Republicans funnel $200billion more into military hardware, this legislation has only $4billion to fight the opioid crisis.

So too is Republican's refusal to call him out for the racist statement. When this resolution comes to the House floor, I will vote YES. https://t.co/UdwJBUHUFUToday, I voted NO on the FISA Reauthorization bill. My statement below: https://t.co/eVgBzrehfcPositive news tonight, but lives are still in limbo. They cannot wait. We cannot wait. Congress must act now and pass a permanent fix. https://t.co/nRuwjZ7k33It was great to meet with @RevYearwood and @EJinAction today. Keep up the good work. https://t.co/cH3Uv88R4fLa decisión de Trump de poner fin a TPS para 200,000 Salvadoreños es inhumana. Estas personas pagan impuestos, sirven a sus comunidades y llaman a América su casa. Esta decisión es simplemente antiamericana #SaveTPSPlease remain safe and vigilant as the rain begins in the Valley. https://t.co/driNItSDN5Trump’s decision to end TPS for 200K Salvadorans is inhumane. They pay taxes, serve in their communities, and call America home. America is supposed to be a country for those who want to work hard and contribute to their society. This decision is simply unAmerican. #SaveTPSTrump decided to end legal protection for nearly 200,000 Salvadorans who have called America home for decades. This irresponsible &amp; senseless decision will not only negatively affect our country’s economy, but it will also tear thousands of families &amp; communities apart #SaveTPSAngelinos, el pronóstico para los Angeles predice lluvias torrenciales e inundaciones repentinas. Tenga cuidado de posibles deslizamientos, dados los incendios recientes. Asegúrese de seguir las estaciones de radio o televisión locales para cualquier información de emergencia. https://t.co/G4lB8FtchWAngelenos, the forecast predicts heavy rainfall and flash flooding in our region. Take caution of possible landslides, given recent fires. Some useful information can be found here: https://t.co/dfY3ksHfQa Listen to local broadcasters for updates and emergency information. https://t.co/G4lB8FtchWGreat news! One less thing to worry about. Back in July 2017, I called out this commission's bogus focus, and its threat to private citizen’s personal data. I asked CA Sec of State @AlexPadilla4CA to stay strong –thank goodness he did.

May your day be filled with joy, love, and peace.My statement on the GOP's Disaster Funding bill: https://t.co/BqliRgNfbcHouse Republican Leadership isn't moving fast enough on the Dream Act. So we @HispanicCaucus went to the Senate. https://t.co/OpVvbmxadYI voted NO on the #GOPTaxScam because it takes from taxpayers' stockings to put presents under Republican donors' Christmas trees. My full statement: https://t.co/WuanlrL0RNAngelenos, Californians, if you're curious about how the #GOPTaxScam is going to affect you, a small sample of can be found here: https://t.co/wioPqnySmpEven as wildfires continue to rage in California, Republicans in Congress are steamrolling the #GOPTaxScam that will punish families that lose their homes to future catastrophes https://t.co/z60L9jqwbXThe #GOPTaxScam gives 83 percent of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent and explodes the deficit. Republicans will stop at nothing to keep their donors happy, while sticking our children and grandchildren with the bill.Americans don’t want this bill -- 55 percent of Americans say they oppose the #GOPTaxScam. Maybe Republicans should listen to their constituents instead of their donors. https://t.co/kpE0w46n3bThis afternoon, the House is voting on a #GOPTaxScam that gives a tax hike to 86 million middle class families. This bill is a disaster for families that work hard to make ends meet and providing for their families. That is why I am voting NO.I'm opposed to Chairman Pai's proposal, but #netneutrality isn't the only thing happening at the @FCC today: https://t.co/rAJda3nLtP40 moments of silence since 2012 and zero commonsense gun bills signed into law. It’s time to stand up for families of gun violence victims and #HonorWithActionThe Local Assistance Center is open through Saturday at Lake View Terrace Recreation Center at 11075 Foothill Blvd. If you were affected by the #CreekFire or other #LAFires stop by to get information about services available to you, your family, or business. https://t.co/pex5tilWNnWishing families and friends in the San Fernando Valley that are celebrating a very #HappyHanukkah!

I am committed to making sure Los Angeles County gets the resources it needs to finish the job and also help families who’ve lost their home. https://t.co/lbm5txsrGjGlad to announce @POTUS answered @JerryBrownGov request and has authorized assistance to fight the fires in @CountyofLA and others.

https://t.co/KMiRuJJAd1Today, I met with FEMA Administrator Long and requested an update about federal resources for the Southern California fires, including the #CreekFire. A challenge of this size can only be conquered if we work together.  https://t.co/m3cJHlDiw3@FabCarrion Fabiola, please contact my district office. My staff will be waiting for your call - 818-221-3718.Angelenos, we are expecting damaging wind gusts tonight through Friday.  Stay vigilant, be prepared, and don’t wait to get to safety.  Here are ways to prepare: https://t.co/m7VbwiOs0E https://t.co/ehvmCnD83qI will vote NO on #HR38 because it makes it more difficult for police to do their job. #HR38 is opposed by law enforcement, @USMayors, @AmerAcadPeds and many others.Just because someone carries a concealed gun in a state w/ weak gun laws and no training requirement doesn’t mean they should be able to do it in California daycare centers, churches and polling places. #HR38 scraps states’ rights.TODAY, instead of trying to prevent gun violence, Republicans are actually passing an NRA priority: #HR38, which allows untrained people to carry a concealed gun ANYWHERE in America.@AtifHajidatoo @LAFD @LACoFDPIO @LAPDHQ @ReadyLA Yesterday Evening, FEMA approved Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs) to LA County. These grants provide Federal funding for up to 75 percent of eligible firefighting costs.As the #CreekFire enters its second day, please remember: listen to first responders and evacuate when ordered. Do not wait until it is too late. Follow @LAFD @LACoFDPIO @LAPDHQ @ReadyLA for most up to date information about the 🔥 and evacuation centers.Our first responders will need all the help they can get to stop to the #CreekFire That is why I sent the following letter to President Trump and FEMA.

Please listen and follow the directions given by firefighters and law enforcement #CreekFire https://t.co/OvALqt5MbvAs a Representative of people, not large corporations, I will not support this #GOPTaxScam. Republicans have turned their backs on the middle class &amp; add $1 trillion to the deficit in the process. Who benefits? Not the middle class, not the country, only #TrumpsBillionaireFriendsThe next step for the #GOPTaxScam is yet another closed door meeting. Early next week we'll find out who will be at the table. Certainly not the American people.As you might have heard, Republicans passed their #GOPTaxScam bill last night at 3 a.m. This is not a tax reform bill and it is not a tax cut bill. Trying to please their donors, Republicans have stitched together a mixed bag of horrible giveaways to large corporations.Seriously, this is not a drill. Turn on C-SPAN, now! The bill is 479 pages long, full of handwritten changes, and nobody, not even the Senators, have had time to read it. #GOPTaxScam being jammed through right now.Attention America!! Senate Republicans are about to rob the middle class in the middle of the night, to give more profits &amp; tax breaks to the biggest corporations. Our children and grandchildren will be forced to pay for this mess. https://t.co/hQj9UYGhQnToday, to commemorate #WorldAIDSDay, we remember our brothers and sisters who succumbed to this disease, and pledge to keep fighting for an AIDS-free world and affordable health care that will help us get there. https://t.co/voUPjPTwgpI’ve been getting a lot of calls about @FCC Chairman Pai's foolish proposal to get rid of net neutrality protections.

That’s why I made sure the SELF DRIVE Act that was approved by the House included my bill to study effects on labor &amp; employment. https://t.co/GmusIMupuxA BIG thank you to all of our service providers that came together today to make sure our neighbors and friends have access to quality healthcare.

Americans have a right to know how their local news will change.If @FCC and @TheJusticeDept approve the Sinclair-Tribune merger, this new massive corporation will reach 70% of American households. We need more diversity, not less.I'm concerned that the Sinclair-Tribune merger will cut opportunities for #diversemediavoices in TV and radio. https://t.co/2NFWQ0t3Nn.@FCC media ownership vote determines whether the red carpet will be paved for the Sinclair-Tribune merger. We need #diversemediavoices in trusted local news.Tomorrow’s @FCC Open Commission Meeting will hurt Americans' relationship with trusted local news.
