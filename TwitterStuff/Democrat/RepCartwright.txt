Nothing was more important to the development of the middle class than America's labor movement. After this week's #Janus decision undermined workers' rights, it's more important than ever that we give Americans #ABetterDeal. https://t.co/l3WogkDOU1#SCOTUS decision in #Janus was not jurisprudence, it was bare-knuckle politics. My bill protects collective bargaining rights for employees. Organized labor is a time-honored tradition in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act defends it #Union https://t.co/TdpO4pd8wjThe #SCOTUS #Janus decision is an outright attack on unions, an attack on working people &amp; the causes we fight for every day. We stand with our union brothers &amp; sisters. This decision will not stop our efforts.

This is a cruel way to try and deter illegal border crossings. I support border security, but now we must end the family separations and #KeepFamiliesTogetherEnjoy your day, Dads!
