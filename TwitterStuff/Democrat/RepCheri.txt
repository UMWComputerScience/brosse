https://t.co/TV0I7JIDjkThanks for stopping by the office! https://t.co/lOw5rQ12ZLGreat conversations during this morning‚Äôs constituent coffee with @SenatorDurbin.

Just a thought.It was great to kick off my morning speaking to @IllinoisFFA. These bright students are visiting our nation‚Äôs capital for their Illinois Farm Bureau Heritage and Cooperate trip. Thanks for saying hi! https://t.co/p8cugri6phThe ruling on #Janus puts special interests above hardworking Americans. #Unions have led the fight for better wages, affordable healthcare and safe working conditions.@GovRauner may have won this round against the hardworking families of Illinois, but the fight is far from over.I've learned a lot from @RepJoeCrowley about the importance of inclusive leadership. He's an outstanding Chairman of our @HouseDemocrats Caucus &amp; someone I am proud to call a friend.I‚Äôm honored to join @RepSpeier and the @campaign_purple for this important discussion about the future of #MeToo and how we can end sexual harassment - this is why I‚Äôm leading on a bill to end the forced arbitration of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. https://t.co/xbrDPGZn2NKeep going - we need answers https://t.co/OtmgGw1K64Hey taxpayers- want to know how much you're paying for @realDonaldTrump's policy of #FamilySeparation and putting kids in cages? Well, so do I &amp; so do more than 100 of my @HouseDemocrats colleagues who just called on @SecNielsen &amp; @SecAzar to come clean.  https://t.co/V0a8Y5BQsA1: The @realDonaldTrump starts an impulsive trade war
2: @harleydavidson moves to ship production overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs 
3: The president threatens to put Harley out of business even though taxes 

Mr. President, when are we going to see an actual strategy?American workers are starting to feel the devastating impact of @RealDonaldTrump‚Äôs impulsive #tradewar. Even AFTER his #TaxScam, @harleydavidson is shipping good paying jobs overseas. Hardworking Americans deserve #ABetterDeal.The @JECDems‚Äô report on Rural America found that more than 50% of water systems across the country with health-based violations serve 500 or fewer people. It‚Äôs time to #InvestInRural and give Americans #ABetterDeal, so everyone has access to clean water. https://t.co/YlH2jv8WEoJust because school‚Äôs out, doesn‚Äôt mean you should stop reading! That‚Äôs why I joined #RockTownReads ‚ÄúShow Us Your Book‚Äù summer reading contest. I‚Äôm reading, Presidential Courage, by Michael Beschcloss. What‚Äôs on your summer reading list? https://t.co/9rsCUcigwWThank you to everyone who came out to the @CWSoftballGame Wednesday night! We had a great time playing the #BadNewsBabes and supporting the Young Survivors Coalition, which serves young women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. https://t.co/yI6cAjDKFxThe #FarmBill that passed that was done by one party in a backroom. I hope once we get to conference, we can come together &amp; develop a bill that strips out partisan provisions and strengthens our rural economy while putting food on the plates of Americans. https://t.co/mYp86W3btmI bet we could pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act right now if @SpeakerRyan would lift his gavel and allow a vote instead of demanding a $25 billion ransom. https://t.co/cxJ5f0fGTV@GarrettHaake Seems reasonable. For the record, taxpayers didn't pay for mine.Does my tactical dress count? https://t.co/X99QZ5yG74Give me a break @SpeakerRyan - this is why people are so disillusioned with Washington. @realDonaldTrump created this family separation policy and you're demanding a $25 billion ransom. https://t.co/ZjcwfYeJs3.@SpeakerRyan- Since it looks like the fake "compromise" bill isn't going to pass, how about allowing a vote on the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct instead? It's the only clean bill to prevent @realDonaldTrump's #FamilySeparation policy from happening again. https://t.co/K09HWcusQ5I never thought I‚Äôd live to see the day when an American President would take thousands of children, including hundreds of toddlers, away from their parents and demand a $25 billion ransom to let them out of a cage. My full statement on today's news here üëá #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/i3MC6eZN39As a representative of rural America, I was proud to help announce the @JECDems report on how we can #InvestInRural and the 46 million hardworking people that live there. You can check out the report here üëáhttps://t.co/0EqwrJHk9SHey @SecNielsen- now that we've heard the children crying, seen the photos of detention camps and learned about your growing toddler warehousing operation, I assume a full apology from you &amp; @realDonaldTrump to all of the people affected by your #FamilySeparation policy is next? https://t.co/WrOQjTO6w2I'm looking forward to discussing the @JECDems plan to #InvestInRural America. Senator @MartinHeinrich did a tremendous amount of work to pull together a really solid set of proposals to create jobs, strengthen schools &amp; build a modern infrastructure in small towns across AmericaI kicked off this morning with the bipartisan softball gameday breakfast with my special guest, actress Megan Cavanagh, also known as "Marla Hooch‚Äù from A League of their Own and a fellow Illinoisan. Can‚Äôt wait to get out on the field tonight! https://t.co/3vrHV6zD2RAnd yet, here we are. It‚Äôs absolutely appalling that @realDonaldTrump is doing this. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/pkCT6A50CDThis is disgusting @SecNielsen. How could you stand at that podium &amp; lie to the public when YOU KNEW your #FamilySeparation camps were overflowing with toddlers SO MUCH that you need new warehouses?

@realDonaldTrump- Moms will NEVER stand by while you play politics with babies! https://t.co/4N1J9O8ak6‚ÄúToddlers are being detained‚Äù - this is a moral outrage &amp; a stain on our nation.

YOU did this ‚Å¶@realDonaldTrump‚Å©.

Since you refuse to lift your pen and stop hurting children, ‚Å¶@SpeakerRyan‚Å© must hold a vote on the #KeepingFamiliesTogetherAct https://t.co/c4QDQuIpML@realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Give us a break @realDonaldTrump!

You &amp; @SecNielsen are asking people not to believe their eyes or their ears. Oh, and also not to believe that Jeff Sessions literally announced this #FamilySeparation policy too!

You can end this with the stroke of a pen.

#KeepFamilesTogetherMeanwhile... https://t.co/X9FBzVdHmoI'm proud to cosponsor the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. @realDonaldTrump could end his #FamilySeparation crisis with a phone call, but he isn't showing any signs of doing it.  @HouseDemocrats are demanding action NOW - Let's bring this dark chapter in our nation's history to an end. https://t.co/GwZUSHJWASFamily farmers are continuing to feel the devastating impact of @realDonaldTrump's #tradewars as soybean futures plunged to a 9 year low.  I‚Äôll continue to work with Democrats &amp; Republicans to stop this trade war, but real damage is already being done. https://t.co/4AXTvRhyXcWe‚Äôre getting fired up for the @CWSoftballGame tomorrow. Democratic and Republican women come together every year to play the Washington Press Corp and raise awareness for breast cancer research. Can‚Äôt wait to #BeatThePress and get our trophy back this year! https://t.co/ZrNQvIcoDtOn one side of the #FamilySeparation argument you have @SenSasse, @JebBush, @SenBobCorker, @LauraWBush &amp; another Republican every few minutes (and literally all of the Dems).

On the other, you have @realDonaldTrump with thousands of kids locked in cages demanding $25 billion.Hey @PressSec - since you just asked people to call their members of Congress, I thought you'd want to know they have been. And since this morning, calls to our office went from 96% against @realDonaldTrump's #FamilySeparation policy to 97%. He won here BTW. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/opuhhCB8tWThis press conference makes me sick. @SecNielsen, you cannot spin your way out of the fact that @realDonaldTrump created this policy of #FamilySeparation - and now you're using children in cages as political pawns.

TELL. THE. TRUTH!

#FamiliesBelongTogetherThis isn't hypothetical.

This isn't political.

This is frightened children crying out for their moms and dads.

@realDonaldTrump, this is because of you.

End this #FamilySeparation policy before one more child is permanently damaged by you.

#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/OGx2KE4hXh.@RealDonaldTrump isn't telling the truth when he says that he's just enforcing the law. #FamilySeparation is his policy and he is choosing to do it. He could end this crisis with call; instead, he's using children for political leverage. This is the opposite of American values. https://t.co/NyGDAp96zMHey @realDonaldTrump - Remember how you won my Congressional District in 2016? Well, since Friday, 96% of the calls and emails we've gotten about your #FamilySeparation policy are against you.

This is YOUR policy and YOU can end it with a phone call.

https://t.co/yabS8ZNNgj.@SenSasse is right. This is not the law, this is a decision by @realDonaldTrump to separate children from their parents. It's wrong, it's Unamerican and it needs to stop RIGHT NOW! https://t.co/1GqSVCDU3J.@realDonaldTrump could end his policy of separating children from their families at the border with a phone call. This is Unamerican and it needs to stop right now! https://t.co/u9z4RYbHL2American Farmers are getting #ARawDeal as Trump continues to embroil the U.S. in a trade war, destroying markets we rely on.

Thank you for your work, Patriece!Just the same, I hope that someday we will look back and see this meeting as a meaningful step toward peacefully ending the North Korean nuclear threat. #TrumpKimSummit 2/2The goal of any negotiations w/ North Korea must be to permanently and verifiably put an end to their nuclear weapons program. North Korea has a history of breaking nuclear non-proliferation agreements, so there is much more work to do to make sure we see concrete action. 1/2The Administration‚Äôs latest actions are just another effort to undermine the #ACA &amp; protections for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions that depend on it.

With so many farmers already getting hit in the wallet by the Trump tariffs, this Harm Bill makes things worse.

Rural America deserves #ABetterDeal.I took to the House Floor because Washington Republicans‚Äô #HarmBill fails to help hardworking farmers struggling to make ends meet as a result of a downturn in the ag economy and Trump‚Äôs trade wars.

Our family farmers across the Heartland deserve #ABetterDeal.After showing Under Sec.

3: Use this debt to justify gutting Social Security &amp; Medicare
