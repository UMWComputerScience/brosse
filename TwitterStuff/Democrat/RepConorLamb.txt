Great to see students from @CVSDcolts and @MTLSD in DC with @FRCTeams. #PA18 https://t.co/qp4bEk87EVThe #Janus ruling undermines the rights of American workers. It hurts the middle class &amp; makes it harder for workers across the country to support their families. Now is the time for us to get to work to ensure basic, critical rights &amp; protections for hardworking Americans. #PA18Thanks to all of the first responders and crews dealing with yesterday’s devastating flooding. Spoke to @ACE_Fitzgerald this AM to offer my support and assistance to @Allegheny_Co and our local communities in the recovery efforts. #PA18 
https://t.co/zWaJB8V2TCI cosponsored the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct (H.R. 6135) to put an end to the cruel policy of separating kids and families at the border. Congress has the power to take action immediately and end this policy. Let’s do what’s right and do our jobs. #PA18 #FamiliesBelongTogetherThis week, I had the opportunity to visit natural gas sites in @PAWashingtonCo and Greene County to learn firsthand about the positive economic impact the energy industry is having on our region. #PA18 https://t.co/fUfKuMLRvJTaking children away from their parents is wrong, it's cruel, and it doesn't make us any safer. This isn't how we treat people in America. Read my full statement on the #FamilySeparation policy here: https://t.co/HcNpzSz4fR #FamiliesBelongTogether #PA18Happy Father's Day to all of the amazing dads out there who fill their children's lives with compassion, love and strength every day. #PA18Tomorrow, members of my dedicated constituent services team will host mobile office hours @citizenslibrary in @PAWashingtonCo from 10:30am-5:30pm.

https://t.co/eHD9wEQpbtTonight I will oppose legislation to cut $7 billion in funding to support Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Outrageous that it’s even being considered, and both parties should reject it. This isn’t the work we were sent here to do. #PA18#VAMISSIONAct is proof of what we can accomplish when we work together in a bipartisan fashion.  We need to protect the VA’s budget from arbitrary cuts to ensure our veterans get the quality care they have earned.
