RT if you agree!Republicans – with a unified government – are putting the American people’s jobs and the U.S. economy at risk with their #TrumpShutdown. I urge the GOP to end their costly, unnecessary shutdown.Active-duty troops, as well as our Guard and Reserve members, will not get paid during the #TrumpShutdown. This is not how we should be treating our service-members. #ShutdownFactsAfter the 2013 shutdown ended, hundreds of thousands of private sector employees could not work and were unlikely to receive back pay. #TrumpShutdown #ShutdownFactsAlmost half of all military medical treatment will be canceled or postponed during #TrumpShutdown which severely limits military deployment readiness. RT if you agree that the GOP should work with Dems to re-open the government.Even though Border Patrol agents and CBP officers remained on the job during the 2013 shutdown, they weren’t getting paid, and morale at the border was low. RT to call on Republicans to compromise on the nation’s priorities. #TrumpShutdownRepublicans have failed to meet their responsibility to govern: 1 million children in Texas, along with 9 million children across the nation, are seeing their health care put at risk. We should work together to reauthorize CHIP and other health programs. #TrumpShutdown12,000 Texas Guardsman did not drill this weekend. Vital readiness drills and paychecks these citizen soldiers will never get back.  Military readiness will be damaged during #TrumpShutdownThe US is facing a deadly flu season &amp; the #TrumpShutdown will only make it worse.
