We will not rest until every child is reunited with his or her parents. We cannot and will not be silent while children are crying out for help. #KeepFamiliesTogetherWe have called upon the Inspectors General of DOJ, DHS, and HHS to conduct a comprehensive investigation into how their agencies considered, prepared for, and executed these misguided and destructive policies. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/ds9MaUqHWHWe have launched our own effort to ensure that families are reunited without delay, and we will continue to demand basic and vital information from the Trump Administration. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/FeGOc6RgtiWe have called for an Oversight Committee investigation into the child separation policy, and I will continue to ask my Republican colleagues to stand up for these children and stand up to the Trump Administration. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/dpxBWvITsjFamilies belong together. I am working to ensure we have truly stopped separating families at the border, that we allow families to stay together outside detention, and that separated families are reunited as soon as possible. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/KZxkt3ensGMy heart goes out to the families and victims of the shooting at the Capital Gazette. We have had to witness far too many of these atrocities, and it is time to put an end to them. I will continue to monitor the scene, and ask you all to keep the victims in your prayers.The House GOP’s “opioid week” failed to address the crisis by providing adequate treatment funding. My bill with @SenWarren, The CARE Act, is supported by the entire House Dem leadership and 60+ Members, but the GOP blocked debate on it. https://t.co/RNiEtMmzlyToday I implored Oversight Committee Republicans to join Democrats request for documents on immigrant children separated from their families.

This is about the soul of our democracy, and I will keep fighting with you. https://t.co/GYDripoVLxFive years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder.

We must protect our democracy.

We want to make sure these families are reunited after the President created this false crisis.I will be on @FaceTheNation in a few minutes. Tune in!We have to defend this democracy.We have been lied to over and over again.Today, I issued a statement on President Trump’s reversal of his administration’s immoral family separation policy. President Trump is the author of this cruel and immoral chapter in our nation’s history, and he will forever have his name affixed to it. https://t.co/MPziJ4wLEUWe cannot be silent. This is not the moment for silence.We are no longer the shining example of what is right.Where does all of this end? When you have toddlers sitting around a room crying for their mom or dad.We must be better than this. Since the President refuses to end his child separation policy, we have introduced legislation to do so.
 
Many of my Republican colleagues have said they oppose child separation, now is the time for them to act. Join us in supporting this bill. https://t.co/h7LjbkzTWPI am glad that Governor Hogan is refusing to use Maryland’s resources at the border. The President can end his cruel child separation policy with a phone call, and he must do so immediately. https://t.co/Av9a82JnRiWe all should be able to agree that in the United States of America, we will not intentionally separate children from their parents. We will not do that. We are better than that! We are so much better! https://t.co/rz8Fh500AlWe have seen the heartbreaking consequences of the Administration’s child separation policy every day. We cannot allow this horrific policy to continue, and our Committee has a responsibility to examine its justification, costs, and consequences. https://t.co/RyQaaaV2lxHappy Father’s Day to all the fathers and families who celebrate with them. I still think about the lessons my father taught me and use them every day.

We cannot allow this to continue. We must say #NeverAgain with our actions, not just our words.Proud to reintroduce my bill with @SenatorCardin to establish a federal grant program for witness protection. This bill will help state and local governments provide needed services to protect witnesses and ensure they feel safe enough to testify in court. https://t.co/S77EPjeauXVery expensive champagne will be popping in drug company boardrooms across the country tonight.

The President must obtain congressional authorization to use military force in Syria, and it is unacceptable that he did not do so before ordering tonight's military action.However, responding with violence will not bring peace. The previous airstrikes ordered by President Trump have not helped bring stability to this country and they certainly will not help now. Moreover, we must open our arms to those fleeing this conflict.Earlier this week we were reminded of the horror and tragedy that millions of Syrians experience every day. The use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime is unforgivable and cannot be tolerated.I call on #POTUS to adopt his own #opioid commission’s recommendation to authorize the HHS Secretary to negotiate directly with drug companies to lower the prices for #naloxone. https://t.co/yMjq93AseoWitness says the rising price of #naloxone forces them to “fly by the seat of our pants all the time in terms of coming up with the medication.” https://t.co/0dcUyiRNmjOn #EqualPayDay we recognize that women make just $.80 for every $1 men make.

A safer America is possible and we must make it happen.In 2018 alone there have been 9 school shootings resulting in injury or death. Thousands of children die each year from gun violence. Congress must enact common sense measures to stop this epidemic. #EnoughIsEnoughI’m proud of America’s students for working to create a
safer world for future generations. Your courage to act on your beliefs is inspiring and I hope that your leadership is the spark that finally brings about real change to #EndGunViolenceI’m proud to have voted for #ACA 8 years ago and will continue to fight for American families to keep their health insurance #ProtectOurCareMy thoughts are with the Great Mills High School community as we grapple with yet another school shooting. I pray for the victims of this horrendous tragedy and my heart goes out to their families.It is inexcusable that a month has passed since 17 young men and women were killed in Parkland and Congress has done nothing to address this epidemic. We must act for them and for the thousands of others who have lost their lives to gun violence. #NeverAgainI join today in solidarity with America’s students demanding action to #EndGunViolence. Young people across the country are speaking as the conscience of our nation, and they are saying with one voice: #EnoughIsEnoughThe future of #NetNeutrality hangs in the balance. The GOP @FCC Commissioners want to kill the open internet. Democrats have a plan to #SaveTheInternet. We must reverse this  terrible ruling. https://t.co/8nzZKgLh7HMeasures to reduce gun violence have broad support from the American people, including from gun owners. For too long, Congress has done nothing to protect our public safety. We must act, for the sake of our children and for generations yet unborn. #NeverAgainMy colleagues and I have introduced many pieces of legislation that would reduce gun violence, but we have been blocked at every turn. I call upon @SpeakerRyan yet again to bring these common sense measures to the floor and allow a vote. #NeverAgainAssault weapons are meant for battlefields, not for our streets and schools. I am proud to join @davidcicilline and over 150 of my colleagues today in introducing the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. #NeverAgain#StudentsDemandAction: So proud of your efforts to save the lives of thousands of Americans--both in the years to come and in generations yet unborn.

My full statement here:
https://t.co/QPidF1SFdESo I commend Chairman Gowdy for taking this preliminary step. But obviously—obviously—the credibility of this investigation will be judged by how thorough it is in obtaining documents and interviewing witnesses, and how bipartisan it is in its conclusions.It is no secret that I have been extremely frustrated that our Committee has done nothing over the past year to address the completely dysfunctional security clearance system at the White House, despite my many requests. 
https://t.co/kjQm8MiiEKMy understanding is that this is a first step, and I look forward to interviewing White House Counsel McGahn, COS Kelly, FBI Director Wray, and others to determine what they knew and when they knew it, which Gowdy said he wanted to do during a press interview this morning.I spoke personally with Chairman Gowdy this morning about the document requests the Committee is sending to the White House and the FBI, which are due in two weeks.But for now, if you are a #TPS recipient, please re-register before these deadlines in order to continue receiving protected status.
https://t.co/LKzg8pu6AsI continue to urge the administration to change course and reinstate #TPS for these countries and I support legislation that would #SaveTPS and provide permanent protections for all #TPS recipients.There are crucial deadlines coming up for #TPS recipients. Hondurans and Nicaraguans must renew their status before Feb. 13, and Salvadorans and Haitians must do so before March 19. You can get more info here:

We stand ready to help in any way possible, and look forward to hearing the Governor’s plan to respond.@iteptweets The average SALT deduction in MD is $12,931 – well over the $10K limit.@iteptweets According to the IRS, 46% of households in MD claim the SALT deduction—the largest share of any state in the country.@iteptweets Additionally, MD is one of the states hit hardest by the new tax law, due in large part to the new $10K limit on the SALT deduction.According to @iteptweets, over 360,000 MD households will get a tax increase under the new tax law in 2019.Today, I joined the Maryland Delegation in sending a letter to Gov Hogan inquiring about his plans to protect Marylanders from the impact of the Republican tax bill’s cap of the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction.
https://t.co/52bix49qpLI condemn this unforgivable statement and this demeaning of the office of the Presidency. I will always fight for the vulnerable among us and against bigotry in all its forms. https://t.co/uffsZkgnfyNo wonder a @QuinnipiacPoll found that American voters reject the #GOPTaxScam 2 to 1, with only 25% approving and 52% disapproving.(3) This is all while the #GOPTaxScam explodes the national debt by at least $1.8 trillion. The GOP will use this as a pretext to slash key programs that middle class families rely on, like Medicare and Social Security.(2) The meager, temporary benefits for the middle class under the #GOPTaxScam evaporate after a few years and the scam ultimately raises taxes on 86 million middle class families.And here are a few other things we know about the #GOPTaxScam: (1) 83% of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 1%.This means that the #GOPTaxScam’s permanent $1.3 trillion tax cut for corporations won’t actually create jobs for Americans like Republicans promised.Turns out the #GOPTaxScam gives U.S. companies more incentive to hire abroad. What happened to America First?
https://t.co/J4A7qBxrW5I again call upon @SpeakerRyan to bring legislation to the floor that will protect these individuals from removal, protect Dreamers and enact comprehensive immigration reform. #SaveTPSTPS recipients are repeatedly and thoroughly vetted by the U.S.    The Administration made clear it is more important to destroy families rather than protect them. #SaveTPSThe Trump Administration's decision to end legal protections for nearly 200,000 Salvadorans cruelly and needlessly upends the lives of these individuals and the lives of their children. #SaveTPSThe Trump Administration decided to continue its cruel immigration policy by ending TPS for hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans living in the U.S. Congress must act to protect TPS recipients.
