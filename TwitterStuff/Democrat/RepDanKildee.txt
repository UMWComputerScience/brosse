Happy Birthday, Rep. Collin Peterson! Grateful for your bipartisan work supporting our country’s farmers..@POTUS implemented his cruel policy of separating children from their parents and created this humanitarian crisis. More than 2,000 children were separated from their families and the Trump Administration must reunite them immediately. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/royvIqpivpOur district is expected to reach 100 degrees this weekend. In such extreme heat, it is important to stay indoors, stay hydrated and never leave kids or pets unattended in a car. Learn more about how to protect yourself: https://t.co/dmV7B3NI1tThank you @TulsiGabbard for speaking up for my hometown of #Flint. Congress must get serious about investing in infrastructure, including our aging water systems. https://t.co/MVLBrzybM4Great to spend the evening with everyone who is a part of My Brother’s Keeper in #Flint. Grateful for their important work to provide more opportunity for youth in our community. https://t.co/PX6pDcZ4XIHeartbreaking news out of Annapolis.

We must do more to prevent gun violence in this country. https://t.co/nD3p6HZLY2Flint native @terrycrews' testimony is a powerful message about the way we treat sexual assault survivors in America. His brave story should be an inspiration for all levels of government to do more to protect survivors. https://t.co/VN9SYletnwUnions support hardworking families and make our communities stronger. Working people should have the right to join together in a #union and advocate for fair pay and a safe workplace. #UnionStrong https://t.co/44Ta6qygllProud to be at the @AFLCIO for an important discussion with Dr. @MonaHannaA about her new book, #WhatTheEyesDontSee. What happened to #Flint is not an anomaly—rather, it’s a warning to all Americans. Flint families still need our support. #IdeasatWork https://t.co/PEUZ4NqKu9Great discussion today on the ways we can grow the economies of older, industrial cities like Flint, Saginaw and Bay City. Programs like Opportunity Zones can help create jobs, raise wages and expand opportunities. https://t.co/47Xf16QW7kIn a majority of states, #LGBTQ people can get married on Saturday and risk being fired from their job on Monday because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. I’m joining @HRC in urging my colleagues in Congress to help pass the Equality Act. #EqualityForward https://t.co/WxcOfL4ZgCThe President's discriminatory policy makes America less safe. A Muslim ban is not consistent with our American values.

To Muslim-Americans: I am disappointed by today's decision but will continue standing with you as we fight for religious liberty for all. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/ZGDZx5P6HdI’ll be live at 10 a.m. ET discussing Opportunity Zones and the best ways to bring economic investment to America’s #CitiesandTowns.

But now, millions of Americans are denied this right. It’s time for Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE so we can truly have a government of, by and for the people. https://t.co/AHuKDgCxkMChildren and families seeking asylum must be reunited. I’ll keep working in Congress to make sure we #KeepFamiliesTogether and reject President Trump’s cruel policies. https://t.co/hGKmqUK49qWishing everyone in Flint a happy #LGBTQ Pride! Every American, no matter who they love, should be treated equally. https://t.co/4SXPKisak2Today marks the 74th anniversary of the #GIBill, important legislation that opened the door to education for millions of veterans.

Investing in entrepreneurs and small businesses helps grow our economy and makes our community stronger. https://t.co/Qowk56Q03OHappy Birthday, @RepAdamSchiff! Grateful for your leadership on the House Intelligence Committee..@EPAScottPruitt blocked this study because it would be a “public relations nightmare.” Now that it is out, we learned that PFAS is more dangerous than the EPA says it is. The Trump Administration must address PFAS contamination more urgently in Michigan and around the country. https://t.co/XRHSvYhW5lCongrats Malan Manwaring on being elected the American Legion Auxiliary @MIGirlsState Governor! https://t.co/ANzZe9egupThe House just passed the #GOPFarmBill, which leaves Michigan’s farmers and families behind. This bill makes drastic cuts to nutrition programs that help keep food on the table for millions of families and children. https://t.co/NQ8vmRwnpuWhat the Trump Administration has done by separating thousands of children from their parents is child abuse, plain and simple. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/17b6dj79RvSat down with Dr. @MonaHannaA to discuss her new book, #WhatTheEyesDontSee, and the incredible work she did to help expose the #FlintWaterCrisis. Dr. Mona is a real hero that continues to help Flint kids live healthy, happy lives. https://t.co/dzXippSxdoWe shouldn't congratulate @RealDonaldTrump on being forced to end his own cruel policy that separates children from their families. Thousands of children have suffered &amp; will forever be scarred by the Trump Administration’s inhumane separation of families. #FamiliesBelongTogetherToday is #WorldRefugeeDay. The UN Refugee Agency estimates that half the world’s refugees are children and the way we treat children is a clear mark on our nation's values. President Trump must end his zero-tolerance, child separation policy immediately. #KeepFamiliesTogetherNew report shows that health care premiums will skyrocket under #GOPTaxScam. By the numbers:

-$701: average tax cut for working family
$1,520: average premium increase due to Republican repeal of individual mandate

= Michigan families lose, paying $819 more out-of-pocket.After blocking its release for months, the Trump Administration is finally releasing a federal health study on #PFAS. The public has a right to have the most up-to-date information on toxic chemicals in their drinking water. My full statement: https://t.co/wkpXlnTZWSThanks, Cherry. So do I (introduced the House bill yesterday)

@POTUS has the authority to end his administration’s cruel zero-tolerance child separation policy on his own, but he refuses to do something, Congress must act. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/UHSddbrRHMThis new @AmProg analysis is troubling and exactly what I am hearing from my constituents: the #GOPTaxScam is driving massive health premium increases in #Michigan and other states across the nation. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/2Hj709PIzsIntroducing legislation today to stop President Trump’s cruel policy of separating children from their families. I joined @RepJerryNadler &amp; @HouseDemocrats to introduce the Keep Families Together Act. Learn more about our bill to #KeepFamiliesTogether: https://t.co/Q4i4lg04MI@realDonaldTrump Update: My constituents overwhelmingly want me to OPPOSE @RealDonaldTrump's zero-tolerance child separation policy. Calls/emails so far:

Oppose: 138
Support: 1

#KeepFamiliesTogetherTo my Republican colleagues: if you remain silent as President Trump's Administration rips children from the arms of their parents, you are endorsing this cruel policy.

#KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/m63UDD31nHAs a father, it makes me sick to my stomach seeing images of children being separated from their parents and detained in cages.

My full statement on President Trump's inhumane and un-American #FamilySeparation policies: https://t.co/d60C98JY3t https://t.co/LOCTPEWXgqI've received 102 calls and emails so far about President Trump's zero-tolerance child separation policy.

100% of my constituents are against the Trump Administration's cruel #FamilySeparation policies.

@RealDonaldTrump: you can end this un-American policy with a phone call.This is a lie.

11,785 children are now in the care of Donald Trump’s HHS, according to HHS. The total has increased by more than 500 in just two weeks.

This Administration's #FamilySeparation policy is tearing children and families apart. https://t.co/v0hX9UqYTUFACT CHECK: @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SecNielsen are not telling the truth when it comes to their own #FamilySeparation policy. It's their zero-tolerance practice that is tearing families apart. The Trump Administration could end this inhumane practice today. https://t.co/Ht0QdKbS92Happy #FathersDay to all the dads out there! Today, I’m thinking of my dad, Jack. So much of who I am today is because of him. Glad I can spend the day with family and remember him. https://t.co/fLUwo1uK36.@RepAdamSmith, Happy Birthday! Glad to have you as a leader on @HASCdemocrats fighting for our armed forces and service members.It is impossible for @MichiganStateU to move forward from this tragedy with Gov. John Engler continuing to serve as interim President. His comments are inexcusable and show a complete lack of empathy for the survivors of Nassar’s horrific actions. https://t.co/YgSsBXuBU3Joining @MorningBriefing at 8:05 a.m. ET to talk about last night’s Congressional Baseball Game.

We are better than this, America. https://t.co/E8GzLUlJSYAfter what happened to my hometown of Flint, I am glad to see the state work to update the Lead and Copper Rule. There is no safe level of lead, and more needs to be done—at all levels of government—to remove lead pipes and prevent exposure. https://t.co/AXcVOZ7Ze2Happy Birthday, @USArmy!

#PollutingPruitt must resign.Bobby Kennedy was a true embodiment of a public servant. His death left an incredible impact on me, and his integrity and compassion inspired me to run for office.
