Honored to stand with those marching across the country today to demand that "Families Belong Together". The Trump Administration must reunite these families immediately. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/MWYG7b1elfTOMORROW: I'll join community &amp; faith leaders at a "Families Belong Together" rally at 10:30 am in the Peace and Justice Plaza in Chapel Hill.  We're calling on @realDonaldTrump to immediately reunite families separated by his "zero-tolerance" policy. #KeepFamiliesTogetherJournalists around the world risk their lives every day covering the news, they shouldn't have to do so while sitting at their desks. We must do more to combat the epidemic of gun violence in this country. #CapitalGazette https://t.co/1HuLTJ3mMLOn the same day it's announced the President will travel to meet with Putin, he repeats the same Kremlin propaganda about meddling in our elections. Once again, the President puts his faith in a thug before American intelligence agencies. https://t.co/4hHsuq9n08My statement on the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy: https://t.co/IjZ4WDE1CjAs the only NC appropriator in Congress, I'm proud to advocate for agricultural programs like the Agricultural &amp; Food Research Initiative (AFRI). I’m pleased @UNC &amp; @NCState will receive nearly $1 million in AFRI grants to support research in agricultural &amp; nutrition improvement.The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new Congress. #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/y0KeVSwxvfWhile another draconian, anti-immigrant bill fails in Congress, the GOP continues to ignore the the majority of Americans that support keeping families together, protecting Dreamers, and rejecting Donald Trump's ridiculous border wall. https://t.co/nnQiarECuEAs we near the end of #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, let's reflect on the incalculable contributions immigrants have made throughout our nation's history and recommit to fighting the discrimination and injustice that immigrants still face in this country every day. https://t.co/79iYEvNuRRNever has an administration combined so much malevolence with so much incompetence.  These are children’s lives at stake. This is simply unacceptable. https://t.co/Dq9ti633JnI'm proud that North Carolina's Attorney General @JoshStein_ is pushing back on @realDonaldTrump's policy separating families at the border. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/0YRDWdEGdYRepublicans are urging federal courts to declare protections for preexisting conditions unconstitutional. In North Carolina alone, that would mean nearly 4 million people would face higher costs &amp; lower coverage. Democrats are offering them a #BetterDeal. https://t.co/iNCEMU8iThAfter cancelling today’s appropriations markup to avoid voting on amendments to #KeepFamiliesTogether, GOP appropriators fled to the White House to discuss building President Trump’s border wall. https://t.co/CoJrOQDxHUThe Equality Act would extend existing civil rights protections to #LGBTQ people by prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity across key areas of life. I join @HRC in urging my colleagues to pass this vital legislation today. #EqualityForward https://t.co/9iUQWzMXYcIn upholding President Trump's Muslim Ban, #SCOTUS has enshrined discrimination and undermined religious freedom. Today's decision joins a list of rulings we will one day look back on in shame. #NoMuslimBanEverTorture is an inhumane &amp; immoral practice that should be condemned by all. On this Int'l Day in Support of Torture Victims, I stand with organizations like @NCTorture, which is shedding light on the role of local actors in supporting these heinous acts. #StandUp4HumanRightsFive years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but there is a solution. Today, I’m urging Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.Today's SCOTUS ruling makes it official: NC voters will go yet another election with unconstitutional congressional maps. Despite the ruling, the facts of NC's redistricting case remain as strong as ever, and I'm hopeful the lower court will affirm its decision without delay. https://t.co/SYjUyEtOPBThis afternoon I joined colleagues in a letter to @SecAzar &amp; @SecNielsen demanding answers on the administration's plans to reunify more than 2,000 children separated from their parents as a result of Trump's "zero-tolerance" policy. #KeepFamiliesTogetherSo excited to meet with Roshana Schaack, Member of the Liberian House of Representatives, who will be visiting Raleigh this weekend as part of @ECAatState's educational and cultural exchange program. @house_democracy https://t.co/ZqZ4TL28LEIt has been almost 24 hours since the President's photo op, where is the guidance @HHSGov? 2,300 children remain in indefinite detention under your care and it seems there's no plans to reunite them with their families. https://t.co/l6Z1PRmj3kAs the @UMChurch on Capitol Hill reminds us, nothing in scripture justifies the inhumanity of separating families. If Jeff Sessions and @realDonaldTrump need a refresher, see Matthew 25:35. https://t.co/vcZcAHzXUJCongressional Republicans are back to the same tired playbook with the Goodlatte/Ryan proposals. Democrats won't vote for bills that leverage Dreamers' futures or end the "zero tolerance" policy in exchange for the xenophobic immigration wish list of Donald Trump.This Executive Order proves that President Trump unilaterally created this dark episode in our nation's history. It also underscores the importance of our collective responsibility to speak out against hateful policy to effect change. https://t.co/JfPgRA1zY8On #WorldRefugeeDay, Congress should send a message that the U.S.—whose story was written by those fleeing oppression and hardship—will not abandon the most vulnerable populations. I'm proud to support H.Res 395, to reaffirm our commitment to protect refugees. #RefugeesWelcomeCruel. Immoral. Unnecessary. Deliberate. Reversible......And costly. https://t.co/ksb1faF2McI'm proud to join @RepJerryNadler and more than 190 House colleagues in introducing the #KeepFamilesTogether Act to permanently end the Trump policy of separating migrant families at our nation's border. #FamiliesBelongTogetherGreat to visit @IBM in Research Triangle Park this morning to discuss data responsibility, digital trade, and education and workforce development initiatives such as IBM's apprenticeship program, whose participants I had the opportunity to meet with today. https://t.co/4IVCLKSk0dOn #Juneteenth2018 we celebrate the abolition of slavery, reflect on the horrors endured by African Americans in our country's history, and resolve to rectify the legacy of racism, injustice, and discrimination that continues today. https://t.co/0UJQbWWywBWhile some Republican members of Congress remain silent or refuse to act, former leaders of both parties agree that the Trump family separation policy is cruel, deliberate, and immediately reversible. https://t.co/od6LIWPRYbICYMI the DHS Secretary just confirmed that President Trump is tearing migrant families apart to get concessions from Congress. This is truly despicable. https://t.co/HKoVRuZFttNot only is the Trump administration intentionally taking children from their parents without adequate due process, they're blatantly lying about doing it. Plain and simple: this is a Trump policy, and a Trump moral failure. https://t.co/6GrQ5sph5GSix years ago today, President Obama established the #DACA program to keep families and our communities united. Compare that to the immoral policies of the Trump Admin, which has decided to intentionally tear families apart by taking children from their parentsOn top of that, they are attempting to weaken health care protections for those with preexisting conditions, rejecting proposals to expand Medicaid to hundreds of thousands, and much more. North Carolinians deserve better. (3/3)Their proposed voter ID amendment &amp; drastic cuts to early voting are a transparent attempt to disenfranchise voters this fall &amp; an affront to the rule of law... (2/3)Just when we thought they couldn’t stoop any lower, the abuses of power and special-interest giveaways on display by @NCGOP leaders in Raleigh this week are setting a new standard for cynicism &amp; corruption...... (1/3) #ncpol #ncgaI'm disappointed that every Republican on the House Appropriations Committee voted against my amendment with @RepJoseSerrano to restore #NetNeutrality. Democrats are working to ensure a level playing field on the internet, Republicans are protecting handouts to corporations.My office has received 14,660 emails/phone calls supporting #NetNeutrality and only THREE in opposition. The fight for a free &amp; open internet continues, that's why @RepJoseSerrano &amp; I are introducing an amendment today to restore Net Neutrality.

Trump on North Korean nukes: “don’t worry about verification, I trust this guy!” https://t.co/Hrg9xdD6XBAfter fulfilling Russia's wildest dreams at the G7, President Trump is now fulfilling China's in Singapore. via @joshrogin https://t.co/wijXOtnFzJ https://t.co/3WSY1QXfx4In abandoning the Iran Nuclear Agreement and hosting this lackluster summit, President Trump has given credibility to the North Korean regime and diminished the likelihood that he could ever achieve a serious agreement. (4/4)The President hastily agreed to a summit with the North Korean dictator with only one apparent precondition: that gross human rights abuses by North Korea would not be seriously discussed. (3/4)In exchange for praising the world's most murderous regime and suspending U.S.-South Korean military exercises--President Trump achieved nothing but weak commitments, far, far short of the Iran Agreement he just trashed. (2/4)A diplomatic approach towards denuclearizing North Korea is always preferred, but legitimizing and embracing a ruthless dictator while alienating our international allies weakens U.S. leverage and is not worth the vague promises offered by Kim Jong Un. (1/4)With each heartless step they take, it becomes clearer that Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump aren't upholding law &amp; order or protecting American workers--they're simply trying to keep people who don't look like them out of this country. https://t.co/TXvFjFC3PGToday, the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect, but the fight for a free and open internet continues. The Senate has already voted to #SaveTheInternet. I'm proud to support similar legislation in the House and to sign my name on the petition to force a vote.These horrific accounts of children being ripped from their parents should shake all Americans to their core. This is not about politics, this is about tearing families apart to spread fear—and my Republican colleagues should have the courage to speak up. https://t.co/KShy1v62tSFrom the border to our own backyards, children are being separated from their parents due to a heartless Trump directive. We must end this cruel new policy of forcibly breaking up families.  #FamiliesBelongTogetherThe Trump Admin has repeatedly tried to repeal the ACA w/o an adequate replacement. Since they failed in Congress, they're now taking their fight to the courts. I will work to ensure that 4M North Carolinians w/ preexisting conditions don't lose coverage https://t.co/IEokkXzZvCAfter spending the week trashing our closest allies, the President of the United States is doing Vladimir Putin's bidding at the G-7. @realDonaldTrump isn't a deal-maker, he's a puppet on a string. If you're not alarmed, you're not paying attention. https://t.co/A7wONEZjtFTrump wants to abuse U.S. laws intended for emergencies and matters of national security to prop up friends and donors in the coal industry. This is morally reprehensible and sets a dangerous precedent. I am proud to join my colleagues to oppose this effort. https://t.co/q3FI0VeOd7It's a shame that my Republican colleagues, @HouseAppropsGOP, don't have the political courage to stand with me to protect the American people.My 2nd amendment would preserve the common-sense offshore drilling safety regulations implemented after the #DeepwaterHorizon oil spill, which the Trump Admin is attempting to weaken...My 1st amendment would block @EPAScottPruitt's harmful "strengthening transparency in regulatory science rule," which undercuts landmark scientific studies used by the @EPA to protect human health and the environment…Today, I offered two amendments in the @AppropsDems committee to hold the Trump Administration accountable for its unprecedented attacks on the environment and public health....@EPAScottPruitt is being investigated for lavish trips to Disneyland &amp; football games on the taxpayer dime. We must follow the facts, which is why I support full funding for the EPA Inspector General to investigate.  https://t.co/9bJZehD9LmNo one is above the law, not even @realDonaldTrump.

Today's #MasterpieceCakeshop SCOTUS ruling tells us how much farther we must go in the fight for equal rights. We must pass the #EqualityActNow.With each preventable and deadly mass shooting that occurs, the need for common-sense reforms to our nation’s gun laws grows more urgent. I join those who #WearOrange in calling for immediate action in Congress. Anything less from
@SpeakerRyan and the @GOP is shameful. https://t.co/yNuYPriohVOne year ago, @realDonaldTrump renounced the U.S.’ role as a leader on combating climate change by withdrawing from the #ParisAgreement. One year later, I still stand with @SEEC &amp; millions of Americans to tell the world that we are #StillIn the fight against climate change. https://t.co/D3vanlvANyIn 1968, North Carolinians competed in the 1st Special Olympics in Chicago. Since then, S.O. has grown into a worldwide movement that uses the power of sports to improve the lives of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Today, S.O. NC celebrates 50 years in Raleigh. https://t.co/CrEpvef4OVLet’s be clear, @realDonaldTrump, demonizing and disregarding people doesn't ‘make America great.’Combined with the President’s reckless attacks on immigrants and his heartless approach to migrant families and you get an Administration that views xenophobia as official policy.It’s now abundantly clear that the Administration’s lackluster response to Hurricane Maria has cost thousands of lives - nearly triple the number of lives lost in Hurricane Katrina. This is unacceptable and a failure of the Trump White House on every level.On this #MemorialDay we honor the memories of the brave men and women who have sacrificed their lives in service to our country. Let's recommit ourselves to upholding and honoring the values that make our nation worthy of their sacrifice.While the President spends another day on his golf course, thousands of families are being torn apart by his administration’s repugnant detention policies. Predictably, he hopes to bargain these families’ futures to secure funding for his absurd border wall. https://t.co/BXZ4ZZp6sNSince President Trump took office, North Carolina's uninsured rate has risen by 1.4% and thanks to continued Republican sabotage of the health care system, North Carolinians are expected to see a $1,400 average increase in their premiums this fall. https://t.co/HTmiSCrLYDCongrats to 8th grader Jonathan Song on being a #NatGeoBee finalist.

As the son of educators, I know that teachers are selfless public servants who want the best for the children they educate. They deserve better. #Red4EdI will be voting NO on H.R. 2, The Agriculture and Nutrition Act, because it fails to meet our commitments to rural communities, neglects environmental and energy considerations, and literally takes food off the table for millions of Americans. (5/5)Additionally, the bill cuts conservation programs by more than $800 million, abandons bio-energy and energy-efficiency goals, and represents a missed opportunity to expand federal support for the organic farm industry. (4/5)Family farmers, producers, and ranchers are still reeling from President Trump's reckless brinksmanship on tariffs, and yet, this bill fails to bolster trade assistance programs and slashes funding for rural development initiatives. (3/5)As @SpeakerRyan approaches his retirement, he is hoping to check off another one of his bucket list items: gutting SNAP benefits by $23 million, putting millions of low-income Americans in jeopardy of food insecurity.  (2/5)Rather than working with Democrats to craft a #FarmBill that supports American farmers and fulfills our commitment to nutrition assistance, Republicans in Congress chose a partisan strategy that abandons family farmers and millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet.

Tune in here: https://t.co/0qGpsCU4JDLast week, I had the opportunity to visit Fuller Elementary School, where I talked with teachers and administrators about how lawmakers can support their work. I also presented them with a flag that had been flown over the Capitol in Washington. #TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/V5hzUatgaw.@realDonaldTrump's casual suggestions to jail journalists or strip them of their credentials is a despotic reflex that should be universally condemned. His affinity for dictators and strongmen is concerning, but when he models their behaviors we must speak out. https://t.co/b5YTQampe7In violating the #IranNuclearDeal, President Trump has triggered a self-inflicted crisis that will increase oil prices and decrease U.S. leverage. He is clearly more concerned with dismantling @BarackObama's legacy than with dismantling Iran's nuclear program.President Trump has consistently demonstrated his ignorance of the complexity of the world’s challenges and today’s decision further highlights his inability to protect U.S. interests abroad. (6/6).@realDonaldTrump's actions serve only to isolate us from our allies, to encourage Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, and to dissuade nations from negotiating agreements with the United States. (5/6)With no strategy in Iran and no vision in the Middle East, President Trump’s reckless decision will increase tensions in hot spots around the world, push the United States closer to armed conflict with Iran, and severely diminish U.S. leadership and leverage. (4/6)In his efforts to destroy this agreement, President Trump ignores consistent assurances of Iranian compliance from senior military and intelligence officials, independent inspectors, and our international partners, including Israeli security officials. (3/6)Since its creation, the Iran Deal has implemented the most stringent verification and monitoring standards ever placed on a nation, successfully preventing Iran from developing or obtaining a nuclear weapon. (2/6)Make no mistake: by reimposing sanctions lifted in the Iran Nuclear Agreement, President Trump has manufactured an international crisis that risks an armed conflict with a nuclear Iran. (1/6) https://t.co/v3rBTCdX9IAs I said in January, delaying implementation of HUD's fair housing rule will hinder efforts to reduce systemic discrimination.

Meanwhile, a minimum wage worker will only see $5.50 added to their paycheck. #TaxDay https://t.co/pyBN4r9AjzDemocrats are fighting for real, bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs and reduces the deficit. @SpeakerRyan is skipping town after passing a $2.3 trillion handout to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. #TaxDay #GOPTaxScamWhile the majority of hardworking Americans won’t notice any increase in their paychecks from the #GOPTaxScam, Wall Street bonuses have jumped an average of 17% to $184,220—the highest since the financial crisis a decade ago. #TaxDayIt's #TaxDay - let's take a look at the impacts of the extremely unpopular #GOPTaxScam:
 
→ Raises taxes on 86 million families
 
→ 83% of cuts go to the top 1% of earners
 
→ Costs federal government $2.3 trillion 
 
→ 13 million lose healthcare coverageSaddened to learn of Debra King @CASAhousing's untimely passing yesterday. Debra was a visionary advocate for the most vulnerable members of our community whose counsel and hard work on housing needs and solutions have been invaluable. https://t.co/Zzo3AxiMPvEach week seems to bring a new mind-boggling story about corruption in the Trump Administration. Administrator Pruitt should step down or be relieved of his position. #BootPruitt https://t.co/onWnHTTDv1President Trump's lack of a calculated diplomatic or military strategy, as well as his disdain for refugees fleeing the crisis, have complicated a situation that will not be resolved by a single bombing campaign. (3/3)A coordinated international response may be required as part of a comprehensive strategy in Syria, but President Trump has yet to develop any such strategy, to consult with Congress, or to seek a renewed authorization for the use of force. (2/3)Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons on his own civilians is abhorrent and beyond the pale, as is the support and defense of the Assad regime by the Russian government. (1/3)I spoke with @ICEgov leadership today to demand answers regarding their raids in our community. I expressed my alarm at ICE's excessive and seemingly indiscriminate conduct, which undermines local law enforcement &amp; sows fear and suspicion in the community. https://t.co/SUZjRbakPfI'm also proud to be attending the Raleigh #MarchForScience tomorrow to advocate for equitable, evidence-based policies that serve all people. It's time to remove politics from science and speak out for investments in our future.Proud to join with @RepPaulTonko and more than 150 colleagues in Congress to cosponsor the Scientific Integrity Act (#HR1358), a bill that would keep public science free from political agendas. #ScienceMatters https://t.co/FjnYUpLJ0EI told @thedailybeast, consolidation of local media isn’t a problem for Democrats or Republicans, it’s a problem for anyone who wants programming that isn't captive to a political agenda.

No student should be unsafe at school. Now is the time for action. #NeverAgain #MarchforourlivesDirector Pompeo’s nomination might mean a Secretary of State who is more in sync with @realDonaldTrump, but it won’t resolve the basic problem he faces: an erratic and reckless President and a diminished and disillusioned diplomatic corps.Rex Tillerson will go down as one of the worst Secretaries of State in history, leaving us isolated on the world stage w/ our diplomatic capacity in shambles. His embarrassment by POTUS may garner sympathy, but it doesn't improve his record of ineptness &amp; self-inflicted damage.North Carolina lost an icon this week in Millie Dunn Veasey. A World War II veteran, civil rights leader, and activist, Ms. Veasey inspired countless individuals in her beloved community of Raleigh and beyond.

Mickey is a true pioneer and a living North Carolina legend with whom I am honored to have had the privilege of working for many years.Proud to join my colleagues in co-sponsoring H.Res.723, which designates February 5-9, 2018 the “National School Counseling Week.” We all need to celebrate our #schoolcounselors for supporting our students’ success and development. https://t.co/I62srpU4n1@realDonaldTrump In the 'old days', we had a president who was smart enough to know that the stock market doesn't always reflect the real economy and wise enough not to claim credit for its rise and fall. #ThanksObama https://t.co/6RB5RO377yThere are 450,000 American citizens without power in Puerto Rico, and President Trump wants taxpayers to pay for tanks to roll down Pennsylvania Avenue to stroke his ego. https://t.co/AAEntP9ijVIn the span of a few hours, @realDonaldTrump demanded a "grand parade" of our military and then called for another government shutdown. https://t.co/GDozbCnVVRJust so we're clear: this is the President of the United States saying he wants to shut down the U.S. government for a border wall he told us Mexico was going to pay for. https://t.co/YZAyACDP5i#WithABuckFiftyAWeek you get from the GOP's tax scam, it would take 2,865 years to earn @SpeakerRyan's salary. https://t.co/ALzNNHyup2It's utterly embarrassing and disgraceful that the Republican majority has yet to pass a workable budget agreement four months into the fiscal year. We can't address critical priorities for our nation by limping from crisis to crisis.The world according to @realDonaldTrump:

Democrats not clapping for his (divisive) #SOTU speech → "Treasonous"

Investigation into his son meeting with Russians offering information on his political opponent → "Witch Hunt"Every dollar spend on early childhood development is an investment in a brighter future. Thank you #kidonomics for providing a platform to highlight essential federal programs supporting childhood education. https://t.co/wxschFY8aGHey @realDonaldTrump, as a former political science professor, I thought I would take this opportunity to make some important corrections for you. #ProfessorPrice https://t.co/wf0q6hDnIWIf @realdonaldtrump had half the integrity of my friend @RepAdamSchiff, he might spend a little more time protecting our democracy from foreign interference and a little less time watching cable news and throwing Nixonian temper tantrums. https://t.co/55m15wOv2xThanks to @lydialavelle and the hundreds of constituents who joined me in @CarrboroTownGov for my 10th Town Hall of the past year! #ncpol https://t.co/0uLbKv645gIn celebration of #BlackHistoryMonth, my staff and I took a tour today of the National Museum of African American History and Culture here in Washington. https://t.co/EreNkXR8SL
