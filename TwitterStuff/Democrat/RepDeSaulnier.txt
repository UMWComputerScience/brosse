I will be going to the U.S- Mexico border in McAllen, TX in mid-July. My colleagues and I are working to visit a detention center, a shelter for unaccompanied minors, and to meet with public defenders. Stay tuned for more information. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/VM3jHXuXWbIn 1,870 days, there were 1,624 mass shootings. The tragedy at the Capital Gazette that claimed the lives of 5 innocent victims cannot become just another tally. On top of thoughts and prayers, we need real action. #NeverAgain

Hope to see you there! https://t.co/zWSqrmoclwI spoke with @nbcbayarea about obtaining confirmation that no tent cities will be constructed at the Concord Naval Weapon Station. #NotOnOurWatch https://t.co/N6myJhpfqN#CA11 is against turning CNWS into a detention facility. @abc7newsbayarea covered the special meeting in Concord. @Lauraanthony7 https://t.co/c91MWIE600.@KTVU highlighted the passion of our community around Trump’s divisive and flawed proposal. https://t.co/jG2xlfPq3lAt this time, CNWS is not currently being considered to house any immigrants, but we need to continue to stay engaged and be vigilant. @kron4news https://t.co/14cCh05XKuWe are pleased to invite veterans to join us at the Lafayette Veterans Memorial Center on Saturday, June 30th at 2 p.m. for a meet &amp; greet.

I am thankful to Concord &amp; the community for their leadership &amp; support in stopping this effort. https://t.co/C11fd5Vg4HWe will be visiting the Pleasant Hill facility that is caring for immigrant children to make sure they are safe, well cared for, and reconnected with their families. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/7GIuh5rm24Watch as @kron4news reports on the shelter in Pleasant Hill. We want separated children reunified with their parents as soon as possible. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/7oFBqhrxDoCreating tent camps is not a solution to #BadPolicy @abc7newsbayarea elaborates. https://t.co/OxWH4kFb0k.@JackieKPIX highlights the lack of clarity around the Concord Naval Weapon Station and the #BadPolicy by this administration. https://t.co/AlqdQMeRdJToday’s Supreme Court decision in the Janus case makes it harder for public service workers – including teachers, social workers &amp; firefighters – to fight to keep their workplaces safe, earn the wages they deserve, and be treated with respect. #Unions https://t.co/5j7rpYludqWe fought this proposal along with our local officials and dedicated community and will continue to fight. It is important not to let our guard down as one tweet can change things. #CA11Pride
https://t.co/UDD5XIJFRjLIVE NOW on Facebook discussing the Concord Naval Weapons Station https://t.co/pHeGHgOkF4FACEBOOK LIVE ALERT:  We are going live shortly to provide an update on the Concord Naval Weapon StationI am pleased the effort to turn Concord Naval Weapons Station into a detention facility has halted. It is an unsafe environment &amp; housing almost 50,000 people there would be immoral. It is important not to let our guard down as 1 tweet can change things.  https://t.co/l7m5vRHMSW.@Haleaziz of the @sfchronicle covered our efforts to halt the Trump Administration’s proposal to put a detention facility at the Concord Naval Weapons Station. 
https://t.co/opfzsx2PbRThe Supreme Court’s decision upholding the President’s #MuslimBan is deeply disappointing. History will be the judge, but our country will certainly be worse off because of this policy.

Watch @abc7newsbayarea coverage of the issue. https://t.co/NXbZTWBFqwOur bill to expand @JohnMuirNPS by 44 acres was signed into law.

https://t.co/9CQ4Bgsk9V#ICYMI: @kron4news covered the Trump Administration's proposal to build a detention facility on the Concord Navel Weapons Station, and our commitment to fight against this immoral and impractical plan. https://t.co/nOv4k27qrQThe @eastbaytimes reported on the unprecedented &amp; thoughtless Trump Administration proposal to construct a detention facility to hold up to 47,000 immigrants at the Naval Weapons Station in Concord.

https://t.co/XuszQLlFyzEarlier this year, we asked Contra Costa residents to vote on town hall topics &amp; environmental protection was at the top of the list!  Please join us for our town hall on “Protecting Our Environment” on July 2nd in Moraga. RSVP here: https://t.co/EkE6QZ1MRP https://t.co/8NLSv3XGC0The fact that President Trump used children as a bargaining chip &amp; threw them in jail, while lying that he could do nothing, is pure evil. After reversing course, he chose a different form of punishment – detaining families for even longer periods of time. https://t.co/xVbmQCGqzfAs the adage goes, “America is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.” 
https://t.co/Hn0Sf5KwKROn World Refugee Days of the past, we have celebrated the contributions refugees have made to our great nation. As we mark the occasion today, we are witnessing the Trump Administration’s inhumane treatment of refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants.How does one forget a meeting with a Russian who offered dirt on Hillary Clinton? 

#RogerStone

  https://t.co/aGnSvMIBnCBy the Administration’s own count, they have separated 2,000 children from their families at the border in less than 2 months. Watch the video below to hear why these actions run counter to who we were set up to be as a nation. https://t.co/LZCzMniuhzWhile Donald Trump and his minions will surely try to spin the #IGReport as fake news, the real fake news is their claims of tax cuts helping working people and their false promises of affordable health care that protects those with pre-existing conditions.At a time when the American people are left to decipher fact from fiction, I have great respect for Inspector General Michael Horowitz and the work of the IG’s office.The IG report released today makes it crystal clear that James Comey applied a double standard to the investigations of Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump prior to the 2016 election, and that these actions resulted in helping to elect Trump as President. https://t.co/3UBEWBD4LKOur bipartisan bill w/ @RepBuddyCarter to curb fraudulent prescriptions of opioids passed the House. With the opioid prescribing rate increasing by 56% over the last 20 yrs the risk of fraudulent prescriptions is greater than before. More on the bill here: https://t.co/8Zi8M2Guno https://t.co/5mCcPVd9hJThe DOJ is refusing to defend a key provision of the ACA—a politically motivated move born out of the Trump Administration’s desire to sabotage the American health care system. This decision led to the resignation of a highly-respected, senior DOJ official
https://t.co/MnKC7HogltScott Pruitt’s 14 different scandals are a disgrace to the office and what we expect from our government officials…and it just keeps getting worse. Time to #BootPruitt!

https://t.co/6hxnprr07zOn the same day we sent this letter @MassAGO filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of illegally promoting the use of opioids. This coupled with the DOJ report may provide evidence of just how negligent the company has been with human life. https://t.co/NfIQKARdYu.@RepCummings and I called on AG Sessions to produce this report which included recommendations from federal investigators that 3 top executives be indicted on felony charges. Read more here: https://t.co/DgIlbxqrhjA 2006 DOJ report concludes that Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin and company often linked with the genesis of the opioid epidemic, concealed information about the widespread abuse of the drug long before it admitted to learning of such abuses.If the #TrumpKimSummit were an honest effort to create a pathway to denuclearization, we would be working with our allies on an acceptable &amp; verifiable plan. Trump’s actions show that he is constantly looking for his 15 minutes of fame, not for solutions to make our world safer.Today’s meeting between @POTUS &amp; Kim Jong Un was all flash &amp; no substance. After disrespecting our allies at the G7 meeting, Trump turned around &amp; pledged allegiance to a dictator responsible for heinous war crimes &amp; violent repression of his own people.
https://t.co/YOR1bZBqQYToday, we honor the memory of the 49 victims of the #PulseNightclub shooting by standing firm in our commitment to enact commonsense gun reforms and to #disarmhate.

This inhumane and unjust policy must be stopped. #KeepFamiliesTogether
https://t.co/gThQK5VRMZ.@POTUS's “Zero Tolerance” policy has separated more than 650 children from their parents. Often parents arrive at our border to escape the atrocities they were experiencing. Forcibly separating a family during a time of crisis causes even greater trauma &amp; is morally depraved.From @axios: “White House officials find it as difficult as ever to get real news and real facts into the president's hands.” 

Does anyone else find this as disturbing as I do? 

https://t.co/uCVF8SgDP3The EPA must stop #CensoringScience and start protecting the health of our communities and planet. I am proud to stand with over 100 of my colleagues to demand that the EPA stop selectively suppressing scientific data. #ScienceNotSilence https://t.co/yosoZ86YsGBy cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, the #GOPTaxScam has weakened Medicare’s solvency by 3 years—funds are expected to run out in 2026. The @GOP continues to destroy the secure retirement seniors have earned. 
https://t.co/xtuLyByPnHEvery American should want our Constitution’s anti-corruption provisions enforced. 1 yr ago, @MyConstitution &amp; 198 Members of Congress, myself included, filed a complaint against @POTUS for violating the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause.

https://t.co/OLFcWIaBcqI am pleased to invite you to our town hall next Monday, June 11th at the Danville Community Center – you will have the opportunity to hear a legislative update, ask questions &amp; share your thoughts on key policy issues. RSVP here: https://t.co/EkE6QZ1MRP https://t.co/UupgDM4zNYThere's still 1 facility in the U.S. that uses shock therapy on patients w/ disabilities despite the evidence that it is cruel &amp; ineffective. I urged @SecAzar to simply add his signature to a proposed rule to ban the inhumane use of shock therapy on individuals w/ disabilities. https://t.co/ngVticXeEwThe commuters who pay the tolls on the most congested corridors in the Bay Area, such as I-80, need immediate relief in the form of a new transit and vehicle Bay crossing. https://t.co/lVO3fLDP7OIf the 35 projects included in RM3 are not completed on time and on budget the public deserves timely and honest information about delays and cost overruns, something I have worked to promote throughout my career and in Congress.Bay Area traffic is a serious challenge to our economy and quality of life, and the passage of Regional Measure 3 shows just how desperate commuters are for solutions. RM3 is a missed opportunity to provide significant, timely relief to toll-payers. https://t.co/2bofjuuJoR50 years after the loss of Robert Kennedy, we remember him the way his brother Senator Ted Kennedy described him, as “a good &amp; decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, and saw war and tried to stop it.” https://t.co/1593moASIhScott Pruitt is unfit to head the EPA. The use of his position on behalf of his wife is yet another item to be added to an already long list of abuses. Enough is enough—it’s time to #BootPruit. 
https://t.co/yR4srFG0v2Since 2016, @TraumaPartners has provided mental health care to refugees &amp; asylum seekers at the Mosaic Healing Center in Berkeley. During our visit, we discussed the importance of continued support for refugees, especially given the Trump Administration’s repeated attacks. https://t.co/qbdD2DtNw6Joined @abc7newsbayarea to discuss the importance of civic engagement in our democracy and the deeply troubling statement by President Trump that he believes he is above the law and can pardon himself.

When an LGBT person walks into a store they shouldn’t have to wonder whether they’ll be denied service because of who they love or who they are. #LoveisLoveDo you believe the President should have the right to self-pardon?
Do you believe if he were to shoot the FBI Director there should be no consequences?
Does that sound like the United States of America to you?
In this country, no one—not even the President—is above the law. https://t.co/wp8KsJguSbDoes this sound like a man who has done nothing wrong? https://t.co/5wB0n2KrFiProud to watch Contra Costa Resident @StephenCurry30 leading #DubNation to a game 2 victory #LivingLegendsCA11 Off to game 3! https://t.co/tsDBfPQrX9.@Warriors are back to work at home for the #NBAfinals.

What a talented group of children! https://t.co/XsoIQlismECalifornia is continuing to lead the nation in gun violence prevention efforts with the State Senate passing a bill to raise the age for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21.

https://t.co/0B2l6UtO2xAt a time when tensions are high in the Middle East &amp; smart diplomacy is critical to preventing conflict, withdrawing from the #IranDeal could embolden Iran as a greater threat in the region, will erode American credibility &amp; will isolate us from others. https://t.co/4EEo6eo8qICalifornia has officially passed Great Britain &amp; become the 5th largest economy in the world.
