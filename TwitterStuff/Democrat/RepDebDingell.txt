And to remember that Christ too was a refugee and migrant who traveled to another land searching for a home. #FamiliesBelongTogetherTo join with others to awaken compassion and urgency in governments and all whose decision making can make a difference.To ask God to bring them safely to the place where they long to be, and to always show kindness to strangers and those in need. To support and help the work of those seeking to bring them relief.They taught me to look with mercy on those who are fleeing from danger. To watch over migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, those separated from their loved ones, those who are lost and those who have been exiled from their homes.Growing up the nuns showed me the importance of action not just words. They demonstrated to me that no one should be a stranger to us.Beautiful morning at #AnnArbor #FarmersMarket. I‚Äôll be here until 9:30. https://t.co/v5GDsf28X6It‚Äôs hot out!

Stay tuned for details and other upcoming events. https://t.co/J25mTtuJciThe best part of my day is seeing @JohnDingell after a long week in Washington. But more than 2,000 kids separated from their parents don‚Äôt know when they‚Äôll be reunified. #FamiliesBelongTogetherJoin me Friday in #Dearborn for Congress In Your Community.

5-6:30, Dearborn Farmers &amp; Artisans Market, West Village Commons Plaza

https://t.co/l4ZUGfjRniPhone numbers, email and physical address were included, and more intimate details like whether someone smokes, their religion, whether they have dogs or cats. The list goes on. Congress must address this issue with more than a few angry hearings where nothing gets done.Here's a summary from Exactis' own website, detailing the amount of information they hold - which was left exposed to anyone with an internet connection. https://t.co/pnthXZrR0jHere we go again.  How many more massive data breaches do there have to be before Congress realizes we need to do something? https://t.co/d0AIvKAEz9MI is proud of #FordRouge and the hard working men and women who are #BuiltFordTough https://t.co/khcBt5oSxAThese inspiring girls are the future! Thanks @UnitedWaySEM for organizing the trip, proud to be a part of it. https://t.co/0wHktIrNG4Claire is an excellent advocate for @ChildrensDMC! @RepMoolenaar had a great time visiting. https://t.co/HFRqA0XvciOver the next week, we're hosting six Congress in Your Community events at farmers markets to hear directly from you about your issues and concerns.

Everyone is welcome and no appointment is necessary. 

Locations, dates, and times ‚Üí https://t.co/l4ZUGfjRniWe need to hold hearings on family separation ASAP. These are children, and it‚Äôs our job to protect them and ensure their safety. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/oUhCgTqxoYHaving a hearing aid isn‚Äôt a luxury, it's crucial to maintaining a healthy, independent lifestyle. 

Congress must pass my #Medicare Hearing Aid Coverage Act to cover hearing aids and exams https://t.co/8jO1XjLaSgFor a President whose campaign promises were to bring good jobs back to America, his Supreme Court nominee doesn‚Äôt reflect that priority. We are all stronger together and we must stop the erosion of our labor unions, the best tool workers have to level the playing field. #UnionMake no mistake about it, this is just another in a long series of attacks on working families. #UnionStrong 
https://t.co/4rLHRGmEiJToday #SCOTUS issued a deeply disturbing decision that will mean smaller paychecks because employers will pay workers less without effective negotiations and fewer protections in the workplace. #JANUSvsAFSCMEAlways enjoy meeting with Michigan's FIRST Robotics teams and discussing the importance of expanding STEM programming throughout the state. Thanks for stopping by! https://t.co/ECmCiov9wTOn the steps of the Supreme Court, I was clear that today's decision undermines a fundamental pillar of our constitution. The discriminatory #MuslimBan is a violation of freedom of religion. We are fighting for the heart and soul of who we are in America. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/oErdKniPwcWhether it‚Äôs getting a job or an education, accessing the news or expressing yourself online, a fair and open Internet is essential to the success of our country. We need to restore #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/N9PkneGXjyMarriage equality is the law of the land, but #LGBTQ people still risk being fired from their job or denied housing because of who they are. This is unacceptable. #EqualityForward https://t.co/4sz68AZFDzVoting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, Americans want the full freedom to vote back. It‚Äôs time to #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/C951bTlJeeStopping family separation is a good first step, but how is the Trump Administration working on reunifying these families? 

It‚Äôs wrong to give parents the false choice of dropping their asylum claims to see their children. #FamiliesBelongTogether#TitleIX has helped ensure all students receive equal rights in education and are free from sexual violence. #TitleIXat46Thanks @detroitnews for recognizing the strength and resilience of my friend Cindy Garcia. The Garcia family‚Äôs story is why we must commit to working in a bipartisan manner on comprehensive immigration reform. #FamilesBelongTogether

https://t.co/KZFeIcY1pVI‚Äôm asking to tour the facilities as soon as possible. It‚Äôs our job to make sure they are getting the best care possible.This is not over, kids are still arriving in MI. We will take great care of them, but it won‚Äôt replace being in their parents arms. #FamiliesBelongTogetherHonored to have President Gerald Ford's son, Mike, and his family visit the Capitol today! It was touching to hear colleagues from across the aisle recount stories of ‚Äòthe good old days‚Äô while taking the kids on the House floor. https://t.co/K3Y34hOQcnüëèüëèüëè https://t.co/i25qamoDgw.@GM's announcement that Blazer production is moving to Mexico is further evidence that we need to renegotiate #NAFTA.It is hard, but we must do it. The two bills that we have seen this week do not accomplish that.We must commit to work in a bipartisan manner on comprehensive immigration reform that:
secures our borders
respects families
provides permanent protections for #Dreamers
helps employers
provides a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living and contributing to our country.Yemen remains in a constant state of war. Failing to extend TPS for Yemenis who have it will put many men, women, children, and families in jeopardy and do much to undermine the security of the American homeland.

https://t.co/hpzG5ZJQYO.@RepAnnieKuster and I led nearly 60 House women is demanding answers. #WhereAreTheGirls 

https://t.co/p7WBuatp1SIt‚Äôs un-American what happened at our border. What‚Äôs worse is we don‚Äôt know #WhereAreTheGirls, the conditions under which they are residing after being torn from their parents arms, and we don‚Äôt know how they are being protected, supported, or plans for reunification. https://t.co/elETgqdUhxIn the letter, we ask @DHSgov and @HHSGov to give specifics as to how many children have been separated, how many facilities are housing them, how their safety and care are being ensured, and what the plans are for family reunification. #WhereAreTheGirls#WhereAreTheGirls? @RepAnnieKuster and I led a letter with more than 50 women in the House pressing the Trump Administration to release details about immigrant children separated from their parents.
MORE: https://t.co/p7WBuatp1SGood luck to my colleagues playing in @CWSoftballGame! #BeatCancerWe need to do everything possible to stop the practice of family separation. The #Trump Administration‚Äôs policy is cruel and inhumane. The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct promotes family unity. #Familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/tibpvYPLQb#Medicare4All will reduce complexity and unify our healthcare system to deliver patients with fairer, more affordable, and more access to coverage. With everything else going on, we are still fighting for improving healthcare for you! https://t.co/qCWog58m2WToday is #WorldRefugeeDay ‚Äì no joke. The US is the land of opportunity for refugee families, tearing families apart is a stain on our image. #FamiliesBelongTogether#WhereAreTheGirls? We need answers. @DHSgov photos don‚Äôt show girls and @SecNielsen won‚Äôt answer reporter questions. I‚Äôm so upset and won‚Äôt stand for this. https://t.co/JI5zk2iKtxThis is nothing but a backdoor attempt to repeal the ACA and if the Administration thinks they can sneak this by in the midst of all the other chaos they are causing, they are wrong. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/6ASi3Y6vc3On #Juneteenth, we commemorate the day of freedom for thousands of enslaved African-Americans and recommit ourselves to the fight for justice and equality for all. https://t.co/ATGBLltTEBMichigan Avenue will connect the @UMich, the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run, @Ford World HQ in Dearborn, and the new Central Station development right in Corktown.Today is a great day for Michigan. @Ford‚Äôs bold vision for #MichiganCentralStation means more than just more jobs, it will ensure that the heart of the auto industry stays right here in Michigan.@AARPMichigan There‚Äôs a lot going on in Washington right now, but I‚Äôm committed to addressing these important issues by reaching across the aisle to find common sense solutions.Joined @AARPMichigan for a phone call about care giving, improving retirement security, and protecting social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. https://t.co/oPUg876YWbThanks @NIH! Your support helps @UMich stay at the front of research and innovation. https://t.co/1pWAC2JbrAICMYI: Joined @MSNBC's @AlexWitt to discuss our moral responsibility to come together- Democrats and Republicans- to protect and care for innocent children, not rip them away from their parents. Watch here‚Üí  https://t.co/pimld0G8HKThe stories from the border make me ill. Babies ripped away from their breastfeeding mothers. Fathers driven to suicide. These are not American values. It‚Äôs cruel, inhumane, and does nothing make us a safer country. #FamiliesBelongTogetherHappy Eid al-Fitr to all celebrating in Michigan and across the country! Wishing you a peaceful and joyous celebration with family and friends. #EidMubarak https://t.co/wLvbfhi2nxGood luck to all my colleagues playing in @Thehillbaseball. #PlayBallToo many families are struggling to afford child care during the summer school break. I urge my colleagues to support the Child Care for Working Families Act, which would help working parents get their kids high-quality, safe #summercare!The House took a good first step to address the opioid crisis which is ravaging every corner of our country by passing numerous bipartisan bills- including three I led with Michigan Republicans. More‚Üì https://t.co/3abINvfwt5This is not some academic debate ‚Äì this is life or death for people. We need to come together to improve access to health care insurance for all Americans. My statement ‚Üì https://t.co/I2j9I59k1zToday, the @FCC‚Äôs repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect. The Senate has voted to #SaveTheInternet, &amp; I‚Äôm proud to support the same legislation here in the House that will bring #NetNeutrality back. Keep making your voices heard- the fight for a free &amp; open internet continues! https://t.co/H8fT8Ypn0BSpoiler alert: it won't. https://t.co/sC0iEjXYa9While this is another in an ever growing line of mistakes for Facebook, this is the first time they have been proactive in responsibly disclosing a breach of privacy. If only there was this amount of candor during Mr. Zuckerberg's testimony in front of Congress.Privacy should always be the default, and this mistake exposed 14 million people's posts to anyone with an internet connection. https://t.co/1tlCWmMY1mThis is now a done deal‚Äî looks like the President is more focused on what he can do for China, rather than the American worker and protecting our national security. https://t.co/VRGgpZuOCXJoined 100+ colleagues today to demand @EPAScottPruitt withdraw his proposed transparency rule allowing @EPA to selectively suppress scientific evidence. Scientific integrity matters‚Äî#CensoringScience will negatively impact public health &amp; the environment for future generations. https://t.co/7jxuz53jkwThis #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, we celebrate the extraordinary contributions that generations of immigrants have made to enrich our communities, our economy, our culture and our country. https://t.co/5OMd3HS7Pi74 years later, we remember the brave young soldiers who risked everything to defend our freedom and save the world. May we never forget the members of the Greatest Generation who bravely fought and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. #DDay https://t.co/PqKbrJQFunAmericans shouldn't have to worry that their personal information is being sent to servers in China. Congress needs to investigate these issues to understand the size and scope of this problem, pass legislation prevent this from happening again and protect consumer privacy.This is outrageous. Why does Huawei, a company that our intelligence community said is a national security threat, have access to our personal information? With over 184 million daily Facebook users in US &amp; Canada, the potential impact on our privacy &amp; national security is huge. https://t.co/VvocPGNOKGIf you‚Äôd like to see a more detailed and technical breakdown in to this reporting, here is the former Chief Technical Officer for the FTC who helped contribute in the NYT article. https://t.co/rdLk1IyTFWThere is a trend developing. Mr. Zuckerberg needs to either address this issue publicly or Congress needs to invite him back to address this in person. We need to hold more hearings on these issues and should pass legislation to improve trust between platforms and users.The fact that this practice was allowed to continue for years shows that the value companies place on our privacy is monetary - not moral. Facebook has a massive reach and an even larger responsibility to do what is right by their customers.In his testimony before Congress Mr. Zuckerberg didn‚Äôt use the word transparency once ‚Äì now we know why.  We didn‚Äôt sign up for Facebook to let outside companies collect our and our friends' relationship status and private messages. https://t.co/O7X36uAm3pRacism and bigotry have no place in our politics, and especially not in the White House. Freedom of religion is a fundamental pillar of our democracy and we must stand together as Americans to protect the values and ideals that make this nation great. https://t.co/di4FEK3ALwConcerned about the appalling comments reportedly made by newly appointed Chief of Staff to the White House Natl Security Council. In Michigan &amp; across the country, Muslim-Americans are doctors, lawyers, teachers, community leaders and some of the most patriotic Americans I know.Joining @NewDay on @CNN at about 7:30am to discuss trade and tariffs. Hope you can tune in!Throughout the month of June, we celebrate and honor the tireless determination of our LGBTQ community and recommit our efforts to achieving full equality for all. Happy #PrideMonth! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàHardworking women and moms deserve to be paid equally and recognized for their contribution to the national economy- because when women earn equal pay for equal work, our families and communities thrive.Today is #MomsEqualPay Day, which symbolizes when, more than five months into the year, mothers' earnings finally catch up to what men with children were paid in the previous year. https://t.co/6bVJC1MYbEOn #MemorialDay, we come together to honor the legacy of the American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice defending our country and the democratic values we hold dear. Their courage, their character and the enduring power of their example truly embody the best of America. https://t.co/LNw37cq2k7No survivor anywhere‚Äîincluding the ranks of our military‚Äîshould have to live in fear of reporting a sexual assault or other serious crimes. Pleased my provision to address military sexual assault w/ @RepAnnieKuster &amp; @RepMiaLove was included in the #NDAA. https://t.co/IUkgpFbLv4Troubled that leaders in the Olympic community could not sufficiently answer concerns regarding the complete failure of the systems meant to protect young athletes. Yesterday‚Äôs hearing made it clear- the time for talk is over and now the Olympic Committee must walk their talk. https://t.co/GrQC3185vuSo glad to have Elazar Norton, an incoming @UMich student, join us for Congressional Foster Youth Day! #FosterYouthVoices https://t.co/2Hynyd8Bd7The fight for a free and open internet continues. Proud to sign my name to the House discharge petition to force a vote on #NetNeutrality https://t.co/KzN2zkAZsoAnother shooting that is shaking this nation. Our hearts are with the victims, their families and all affected by the horrific tragedy in Texas. Inaction is inexcusable. We have got to keep our kids safe.SNAP is invaluable to parents struggling to put food on the table and children who need proper nutrition to grow up healthy and strong. Under the #GOPFarmBill, approximately 2 million Americans would lose these critical benefits. We must #ProtectSNAP https://t.co/AEmEyCCSr6Proud to sign the bipartisan #QueenoftheHill discharge petition to bring #DACA legislation to the House floor immediately. These young people are our friends, neighbors &amp; part of the fabric of our communities. We must ensure they are able to stay in the country they call home.Years of research show that three square meals a day can be the difference in a child‚Äôs success in school. Yet, under the #GOPFarmBill, 265,000 kids will lose access to free school lunches, negatively impacting their ability to focus &amp; learn. Unacceptable. #HandsOffSNAPSNAP is a lifeline for the 2 million Americans who will lose access to food assistance if the #GOPFarmBill is passed.

Parents, veterans and seniors should not have to wonder how they're going to put food on the table. Congress must #ProtectSNAP now. https://t.co/Xc3f2sJWCeToday we're urging @POTUS to reverse his decision to eliminate role of Cyber Security Coordinator. At a time when we face increased #cyber threats to our election systems &amp; infrastructure, we must build on our capacity to combat these threats, not take needless steps backwards. https://t.co/JVTf2bicosPressed @EPA today to keep everyone at the table working toward One National Program for fuel economy standards that protect jobs &amp; the environment &amp; save consumers money at the pump. Everybody wins if we work together; everybody loses if we don't. https://t.co/vU0qFAoOqfThe Senate votes today to #SaveTheInternet.

The #ACA is not perfect, but instead of trying to sabotage the law, we should be working together to fix it, bring down costs &amp; expand affordable, quality care.Today marks one year since House Republicans passed their devastating #ACA repeal bill, which would have ripped health insurance from at least 23 million Americans, gutted protections for pre-existing conditions, ended Medicaid expansion &amp; charged older Americans more for care.As we work to address #CampusSexualAssault, it's critical that universities are equipped to support all students. One demographic of sexual assault survivors remains largely under the radar &amp; underserved: students with disabilities.

We‚Äôll keep on looking for answers to how many people had their data compromised and will hold bad actors accountable. https://t.co/XYvTdL92eI https://t.co/W6JjTsvyivDisappointed that @AjitPaiFCC says the situation is ‚Äúunclear‚Äù yet decides not to investigate? Unclear situations demand investigation. Punting to the @FTC is an abdication of the agency‚Äôs duty and raises more questions than it answers.Received response from @AjitPaiFCC to my letter asking @FCC to investigate extent of privacy violations by Cambridge Analytica &amp; whether consumers' viewing or other personal data was also sold to the company. This is essential‚Äîwe need to know the full extent of this incident.Better late than never! My friend Rep. @janschakowsky made good on our @umichbball vs. @RamblersMBB Final Four wager.

Watch live: https://t.co/SKS7RNM7pBNaps are okay, but I thought I hid the cupcakes. Yogurt &gt; Hostess. https://t.co/kNHn6sWbIAPres. Trump's Muslim ban runs counter to our Constitution &amp; values as Americans. Nat'l security experts have warned that it hurts, not helps, our fight against terror. It does not reflect who we are &amp; it is my hope SCOTUS rules this hateful ban unconstitutional. #NoMuslimBanEverThe Flint water crisis is not an anomaly‚Äîit can happen anywhere in any community across this country. As Flint continues to recover, Congress can‚Äîand must‚Äîmake critical investments in water infrastructure to ensure this never happens again. #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/l1OzlYKySgToday @RepDonBeyer &amp; I are leading 87 Representatives in calling on Scott Pruitt to reinstate @EPA's longstanding toxic air pollution protections.

The GOP tax law paves the way for future cuts to Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security. We must all stand together to protect these vital programs the American people depend upon.The GOP claimed their tax plan would benefit working men &amp; women. Months later on #TaxDay, many workers have not seen a boost in base pay. One-time bonus &amp; pay raise announcements have slowed to a trickle while ~2/3 of savings flow to company shareholders. https://t.co/EMFaITAWuOThanks for the quick response.

If women were paid equally, they would be able to afford nearly one additional year of tuition or more than 18 additional months of child care each year - money that would go back into our local economies.Today, Michigan women still only earn 78 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. This is an annual difference of $11,044, and the #wagegap is even wider for women of color. This story in the @freep shows why this matters. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/wWAkjz0aT9Today is #EqualPayDay, which symbolizes when, more than three months into the year, women‚Äôs earnings finally catch up to what men were paid in the previous year.

Read more via @Freep https://t.co/vySIquYYJlOn #MLKDay, America watched in horror as Jorge Garcia, a father of two who was brought here as a child, was torn from his family &amp; the home he knows. Honored that his wife Cindy will join me at #SOTU to be a voice for aspiring Americans who deserve action https://t.co/AgV4Ka8bemMemories of the times we have had together....an honor to be with the Doles at yesterday's Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony. @SenatorDole always made us laugh and @JohnDingell and I had civil, productive, respectful relationship with both and value them as real friends. https://t.co/0ELTpfvXkZ.@thechildrensinn helps make childhood possible for children who have already lived through more than most. I am happy to support them and their mission to provide relief, support, and strength to families as they are treated at the @nih.Congrats to Dearborn students Malak &amp; Fatima for being among the 25 students nationally named to the @Smithsonian's Secretary Youth Advisory Council. Looking forward to seeing your unique perspectives represented in museums throughout our country! https://t.co/TCUVCel9MUIt continues to be my position that enforcement actions should prioritize people with serious criminal records who pose an immediate threat to the safety of our communities- not those who were brought here through no fault of their own &amp; know no other home than the United States.Stories like Jorge's - where law-abiding individuals who have lived &amp; worked in our communities for decades are being torn from their homes &amp; families - reinforce the urgency with which Congress must address #DACA &amp; pursue comprehensive immigration reform. https://t.co/b3NMhgfH1TToured #NAIAS2018 today with a bipartisan group of colleagues to see the latest in automotive innovation.  Great to show our friends from Oregon &amp; Ohio the exciting technologies being developed here in Michigan for the cars &amp; trucks of the future! https://t.co/EpLWxj7Qhe‚ÄúSelf-driving cars are coming. This legislation will help ensure they're safe‚Äù ‚Äî my op-ed with @RepFredUpton on the promise of self-driving cars as we kick off #NAIAS2018.

For we know that the fight for freedom &amp; justice is never finished; it is ongoing and constant. #MLKDay https://t.co/JVJBcRYs8uGreat to kick off #NAIAS2018 today in the heart &amp; soul of the auto industry. Michigan is leading the way in the future of mobility &amp; deployment of automated vehicles that will improve safety on our roads, increase mobility &amp; keep the US at the forefront of innovation https://t.co/ys2YrjfbQiNow that the bill is law, we must ensure that working men and women have an understanding of the tax bill so they can plan for the future. My top priority continues to be putting working families first and fighting to protect the programs the American people rely on.Standing room only at today‚Äôs town hall on GOP tax bill. Many questions &amp; concerns about how MI families will be impacted by the plan, which adds trillions to our debt, promotes offshoring of jobs, kicks 13million off of their health care &amp; puts corporations over working families https://t.co/dcs1gk98wpTODAY AT 1PM: Join us for a town hall in Taylor to get your questions answered &amp; learn what the Republican tax plan will mean for you &amp; your family in the months &amp; years ahead. Learn more ‚Üì https://t.co/tSNlBdJBijPresident Trump's offensive &amp; disgraceful remarks do not reflect who we are as Americans or our values as a nation. The President would be well-served to remember that immigrants built this country &amp; continue to make it strong.At the State of the Union, we will show solidarity with women &amp; men across this country who are standing up, speaking out &amp; joining together to say #TimesUp. We must keep working to make this movement real for everyone. @Refinery29 https://t.co/8YBPExtVPhThe opioid crisis has touched nearly every family across this country. The Bipartisan Heroin Task Force is working to advance policies like Jessie's Law that transcend politics &amp; can lead to real, comprehensive action to combat this epidemic &amp; save lives. https://t.co/Lz1To7m7RtIntrigued, but wondering if there‚Äôs a new look for the 20-ounce bottles I buy in bulk. Thankfully, when it comes to the original flavor, @DietCoke knows you don‚Äôt mess with a classic. https://t.co/kfq0ZoWkPLIt has been more than 100 days since Congress allowed the Children's Health Insurance Program to expire. This is irresponsible &amp; unacceptable. Children's health care should never be used as a political bargaining chip. It's time to permanently extend #CHIP NOW. #SaveCHIP https://t.co/vM88CMrRfTWatch live as we announce the updated legislative agenda for the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force in the 115th Congress. Proud to stand with this bipartisan coalition to address the opioid epidemic, which is impacting too many families across this country. https://t.co/MvuIbOrlyRForeign governments continue to flood US markets with artificially cheap steel using unfair trade practices, making it impossible for American steel workers to compete on a level playing field. We must #StopSteelDumping to support workers in MI &amp; across US #AmericaSteelStrongToday we say thank you to the brave men and women who risk their lives every day to protect our communities. We appreciate all that you do to keep us safe! #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/Rd9JE9knH0Have questions about what the Republican Tax Plan means for you &amp; your family?

It's not just about roads &amp; bridges, but aging water systems like in Flint that need to be replaced to protect children &amp; families across this country https://t.co/EiAkMuk7xzA @Lions win! Great way to close out 2017. Happy New Year to all. https://t.co/Ho3l8J5aw2Among the the highlights of 2017 for southeast Michigan is the opening of the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run. Proud of this effort to help transform the future of #mobility, save lives on the road &amp; keep Michigan at the forefront of innovation. https://t.co/qG51yxLg4hMade a friendly wager with @JimClyburnSC &amp; @RepJoeWilson on the #OutbackBowl Monday. When @UMichFootball wins, Rep. Wilson owes us some SC barbecue &amp; Rep. Wilson is offering up a basket full of SC goodies. If @GamecockFB wins, we're wagering some items from @zingermans. #GoBlue!Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all celebrating! John and I wish you all the love, peace and joy of the season. https://t.co/Vgwyg3NPaUOur fish &amp; #wildlife are among our most valuable resources, supporting our economy in MI, creating jobs &amp; promoting outdoor rec.

Pardon the voices (still fighting this crummy cold), but enjoy! ‚Üí https://t.co/8Zyy5Oy7qIVoting NO again on the GOP tax plan. Today's revote shows once again how hastily this legislation was crafted to rush through tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; big corporations at the expense of everyone else.Families in Michigan &amp; states all across the country will soon receive notices that their child‚Äôs health insurance will be canceled because Congress has not reauthorized #CHIP. This is unconscionable. We‚Äôre calling on GOP leadership to #RenewCHIP in a bipartisan way without delay https://t.co/uUArj7zhjZWorking families should be at the center of any effort to update our tax code. Instead, the GOP tax plan that passed the House today leaves working Americans behind. They deserve better. My full statement ‚Üì https://t.co/S3kbQ7QYM7#CHIP is a lifeline for nearly 9 million American children, ensuring they can go to the doctor when they need to &amp; have necessary checkups &amp; immunizations. It is unacceptable that Congress has not acted to renew this vital program. Before leaving for Christmas, we must #RenewCHIP https://t.co/HXrtF13ddjHappy 50th anniversary, @GoParks! Thanks for all you do to support Michigan's #NationalParks &amp; connect all Americans to these treasured places, generation to generation. https://t.co/5YGEjRJzvuDifferent views, let‚Äôs pursue
No matter if red or blue
Let‚Äôs keep taking a stand
Let‚Äôs work hand-in-hand
Till we‚Äôre back walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderlandTrump‚Äôs first year, it‚Äôs been chilling
The New Year‚Äôs near, ain‚Äôt it thrilling
It‚Äôll be a new day, 2018‚Äôs not far away
Walking in a winter blunderlandIn the Congress we will keep on fighting 
Maybe we can find some common ground 
How ‚Äòbout funding CHIP and fixing DACA 
Before we take those jet planes out of townLater on, they‚Äôll conspire
To cut programs we require
Who needs Medicaid
When donors get paid
Walking in a winter blunderlandIn the darkness they can pass a tax plan 
And pretend that workers will be fine 
We say work together, they say no man!
We don‚Äôt need your vote while we‚Äôre in townHouse phones ring
Are you listening
Folks are mad
But Ryan‚Äôs insisting
Another tax fight!
No funding bill in sight
Walking in a winter blunderland

Gone away is Obama
Here to stay is constant drama
We try to stay strong
As Trump tweets along
