Last week, I traveled to TX. What I saw broke my heart. Kids aren't leverage to be used for political games. America is better than this. We should have zero tolerance for these inhumane policies. We’re here today to send that message to the president. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/rzVHi34aK7I met with #WA Grange today to talk about how we can work together to promote our local economies and improve opportunities for our rural communities. https://t.co/0ZZrR0KC1wGreat to join @2018USAGames to welcome the #FlameofHope to #WA01! A big THANK YOU to all @LETRforSO &amp; @SpecialOlympics volunteers and to all the amazing athletes – we are gathered here because of YOU! Can't wait to celebrate this next week! #BetterTogether https://t.co/yMMgs3srApAnd each of the individuals who joined me today have similar stories to share. They are why I'm fighting so hard to #ProtectOurCare. We should not be letting ANYTHING fail for the American people, especially our health care system. So let's build on the progress that’s been made.Or Sue from Kenmore. She had already reached three-quarters of her lifetime coverage limit after being diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer. But thanks to the #ACA, she no longer faces lifetime limits or insurance discrimination as a cancer survivor. #ProtectOurCareTake Paul from Snohomish. His son-in-law died from cancer before #ACA b/c he couldn’t afford the care &amp; didn’t have insurance. Paul told me, “The certificate of death states my son-in-law died from cancer, but I believe he died from a broken healthcare system.” #ProtectOurCareThe Affordable Care Act has helped more than 19 million Americans get quality health insurance, and we need to protect that because we can’t go back to a time where people who needed care most were denied. #ProtectOurCareLIVE: Today, I'm hosting a roundtable with @WA_OIC Commissioner Kreidler to listen to stories from #WA residents about how Republican sabotage of our nation’s health care system is raising their costs and threatening their health care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/2mnT94AGmQSuch tragic news. My heart goes out to the entire #CapitalGazette family. https://t.co/V36Kd6360BFrom my @FT op-ed: "I am seeking to give tech users a clear understanding of what happens to their data and the chance to have greater control. Rather than having to opt out of invasive settings, customers should be able to expect privacy as the default." https://t.co/6dzkbyPrAYGreat to join @ITIFdc and an impressive panel of experts today to talk #encyrption! We need to ensure we have strong policies in place that give consumers and companies clarity with regards to the security of their devices and information. https://t.co/8dkyQWqOaNWith decades of experience in tech, I understand that consumers, policymakers &amp; private sector all share responsibility for protecting personal data from bad actors. As the global leader in tech innovation, the U.S. needs to catch up on consumer privacy. https://t.co/UyANLTQ6ihHey, #WA01! I want to hear from you. I’ll be hosting two town halls this Saturday, 6/30, so come on out and join me to share your thoughts. https://t.co/uAb1IMhWQGIt’s a shame that @SpeakerRyan wasted precious time with another @HouseGOP (anti)immigration bill that wouldn’t have become law and didn’t reunite any of the mothers I spoke to in McAllen with their children. We need solutions, not more show votes. #KeepFamiliesTogetherToday's #SCOTUS opinion is a blow to workers' rights. From better wages and benefits to safer working conditions, #unions play a crucial role supporting working families, and I will keep fighting in Congress to defend them. #WeRiseICYMI: It’s time to permanently authorize the great work #LWCF does to protect and preserve our beautiful, natural places in #WA and around the country. https://t.co/wtysgSqd6jHappy #LGBTEqualityDay! As #Pride2018 comes to a close, let's celebrate all of the progress that has been made on this day and resolve to keep fighting together for full equality. https://t.co/CBB54HUk9iRather than work with any of the Dems that Trump says are needed to get a bill to his desk, @SpeakerRyan continues to give concessions to the @HouseGOP's anti-immigrant members on a bill they still won’t vote for and the Senate won’t even consider, while kids keep suffering. https://t.co/x9mHMWd3TbRemember how @SpeakerRyan and @realdonaldtrump repeatedly said that the #GOPTaxScam would let you file your taxes on a postcard? Well, I guess it’s not a lie if they didn’t say how many postcards. https://t.co/8VBdbK4hMiToday’s #SCOTUS decisions are disappointments to say the least. Elections have consequences. The @SenateMajLdr played politics and tampered with the Court and real people will be affected by these opinions.The #SCOTUS decision on Trump’s #travelban is deeply disappointing. It wholly undermines our nation’s history as a bastion of religious freedom. I agree with Justice Sotomayor’s powerful dissent: https://t.co/OIMotdvJ4kFive years ago the #SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v Holder. We should be making it easier for Americans to participate in our elections, not allowing states to enact laws that disenfranchise voters. It’s time to #RestoreTheVOTE. https://t.co/twGI2JDMHCIn McAllen, I spoke w/mothers who told me they have no way of contacting their kids &amp; haven't even been told where they're being held. They're scared for their kids’ safety, and so am I, which is why I'll keep demanding answers from the Trump administration. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/SHuCfEywecOn this week’s episode of "Why Does Pruitt Still Have a Job?": https://t.co/Kkr0kA4Du0Happy Pride! We've made so much progress in the fight to ensure equal rights for #LGBTQ Americans. Today we celebrate and tomorrow we keep fighting to pass the #EqualityAct so everyone is treated equally under the law, regardless of who they are or who love. #Pride2018It's time for @SpeakerRyan to stop appeasing Trump’s intolerant and anti-immigrant policies and work across the aisle to so we can come up with a bipartisan deal that keeps families together and provides certainty for #DACA recipients. #protectDREAMers #FamiliesBelongTogetherThe Trump administration's continued zeal in pushing their egregious anti-immigrant agenda is inflicting long-term damage on families. I'm in McAllen with my colleagues today to see what's happening with my own eyes and to try to get some answers for these kids and families. https://t.co/TQ4vdHJdPXI'm pleased the House passed two bipartisan bills I helped introduce to address the #opioids crisis affecting countless individuals and families across my district and the nation. https://t.co/xfdKlOnBygToo many people are suffering from addiction that started from an opioid prescription when an alternative might have been available, including a gentleman I met who became addicted at age 17 simply because he was prescribed #opioids when he had his wisdom teeth removed.Big victory as #SCOTUS rules in favor of Americans' right to privacy by requiring a warrant for cell-phone location data. But Congress still must act to update laws like #ECPA and create forward-looking policy that works in today’s innovative and evolving society. https://t.co/y0Z9uP9JY1There's nothing "phony" about the trauma you’re inflicting on children and families. I'm headed to the border later today to see for myself because I really do care. https://t.co/EENErHolxsThat's why I've offered an amendment to invest in areas with high poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness and foreclosure rates, so we can build a better future.But that requires sustained investment, not the #GOPbudget's drastic cuts, in areas that create opportunities for the millions of Americans seeking a better quality of life for themselves and their families.We need a budget that supports the development of a competitive American workforce to encourage job creation and build an economy that works for all Americans. https://t.co/9Wl7Rj1c3xLast year, Genesis &amp; Suzy shared their sons’ stories during the health care debate, and they’ve stuck w/me. I’m sharing them again b/c the GOP keeps attacking millions of Americans’ health care, including those w/pre-existing conditions. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/HZKsGTelltNews flash: The GOP #farmbill is still just as terrible as it was when it came up a month ago. https://t.co/cnOCmCl4KeCongress should invest in a future that provides everyone with the opportunities to succeed. Instead, the #GOPbudget strips away people's health care and retirement security and slashes funding for critical housing, infrastructure and education programs. https://t.co/wldFniAGA6This is a big win for our state &amp; local communities, and brick-and-mortar retailers who now get a chance to compete on a level playing field w/out-of-state internet companies that have maintained an unfair edge by not having to collect sales taxes. #SCOTUS https://t.co/Uds42yx3fYI believe we should give people on #SNAP the tools and skills they need to find good-paying jobs, but it's clear the #GOP simply wants to take away nutrition assistance from millions of Americans and call it “reform.” And that is unacceptable.It’s shameful that the @HouseGOP continues trying to blame low-income families, seniors and victims of hunger for the exploding deficit caused by the #GOPTaxScam. That’s why I’ve offered an amendment that rejects the deep cuts to #SNAP in the #GOPbudget. https://t.co/IX348b0pQpEvery dollar we spend - or cut - is a reflection of our values. Slashing programs that help families trying to get ahead in order to cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy has never led to good-paying middle class jobs, and it never will. #GOPbudget https://t.co/Mq95FyJUBTMillions of people around the world have been displaced from their homes due to violence. It's up to you and me and the global community to come together and say we stand #WithRefugees. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/nHQ4twCWsDToday, W&amp;M held a hearing on civil asset forfeiture. Governments are imperfect, just like the individuals who lead them, and should reverse course when wrong. Unjust policies should be challenged, stopped and remedied – especially when we’re talking about people, not property. https://t.co/yBb6OuA3TBSeems clear. @HouseGOP? https://t.co/NYT2bDz1Nd"It's cruel, it's frightening, it's immoral. We should have zero tolerance for hatred, for bigotry, and for separating children and tearing families apart." #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/sfhnE3zWYuThe #GOPbudget is a clear sign of what the @HouseGOP has decided to prioritize. Once again, they've shown they're willing to throw millions of Americans under the bus to pay for the exploding the deficit caused by the #GOPTaxScam. Our kids deserve a better future than this. https://t.co/cPRyFWhH99Americans deserve a Congress committed to improving on the progress we've made to deliver affordable care to all, including those with pre-existing conditions. We should work on helping even more families, not luring them into buying plans that won’t protect them. #ProtectOurCareThis rule change brings us backward, to the days when getting sick could leave a family bankrupt, and drive healthy people out of the markets, pricing out the folks who need health care the most.The President and GOP are actively sabotaging Americans’ health care and driving up costs by bringing back scam plans that may not cover critical care like emergency room visits, maternal care or chemotherapy. https://t.co/doBJAZUDqOWhat's more, they've resorted to misleading &amp; lying in order to stoke anger, fear &amp; resentment. We're better than this, America. We are stronger and freer because of immigrants, and we should continue to be welcoming to those who are "hurtling through the darkness, toward home."From expelling/banning refugees to detaining/deporting #DACA recipients and legal residents, to the current travesty of separating families seeking asylum, the Trump administration's xenophobia is infesting our country's immigration policy. https://t.co/AP8FvW5jYh.@HouseGOP just released their budget – part 3 of their act to reward corporations &amp; wealthiest, paid for by YOU. With massive cuts in #SocialSecurity, #Medicaid &amp; #Medicare, and a hard “pass” on investments in our future, this #GOPbudget will hurt Americans in all walks of life. https://t.co/uwdC3SP2OwI implore my @HouseGOP colleagues to stop acquiescing to this lunacy and call on President Trump to reverse his inhumane decision to place children and their parents in traumatic situations. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/aZlePr6vKSWatch live as I join with asylum recipients now living in #WA to hear their stories of why they fled their homes to come here. The Trump administration’s cruel policies of refusing asylum to those seeking shelter from violence must end. https://t.co/2j6353lTQoTo be clear, there is NO law that requires the separation of families seeking asylum. The responsibility for this cruel and reprehensible policy rests solely on the Trump administration. It MUST end now. #KeepFamiliesTogether  https://t.co/no7IjtM9bf“It is immoral. And it breaks my heart." I agree with Laura Bush. We "should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores." #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/8ImjlERKKwHappy Father’s Day, #WA01! https://t.co/3KNoxrEzKvTime to shine down in Omaha! Good luck, @UW_baseball! #GoHuskies #dawgstrong https://t.co/lknYPKEBn7How does trade affect you? I joined local brewers at @WashingtonBeer's 13th Annual Festival today to talk about the impact aluminum and steel tariffs may have on their brewery operations and costs. https://t.co/KGDIQec3oEIn the Bothell area today to tour #WRIA8’s salmon and habitat restoration projects, and discuss how the federal government can work with local partners to restore and protect habitat that salmon need to survive. https://t.co/t3UnXMF9Ku#EidMubarak to everyone celebrating Eid al-Fitr! https://t.co/gEmlz1UVO6Just as they did with #DACA, the President and AG Sessions are manufacturing crises to use as leverage for their anti-immigration agenda - all at the expense of kids, families and our country’s values. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/V6bfEWnrjENow here we are, six years after @POTUS44 announced #DACA, which let young immigrants contribute to our communities out of the shadows. But instead of trying a bipartisan solution, @SpeakerRyan has again corralled @HouseGOP into anti-immigrant legislation that betrays our values. https://t.co/WtmRW9R0lISurprise, surprise. The #GOPTaxScam's trickle-down economics don't help hardworking Americans or expand the middle class. Instead, wealthy corporations continue to horde the benefits of the massive giveaway, paid for by millions of middle class Americans. https://t.co/Ox5mfkYvTHICYMI: The Trump administration is actively arguing for the elimination of #ACA protections that ensure health care coverage for the millions of Americans living with pre-existing conditions. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/UCz7lMMwH7A very happy birthday to two of #WA’s Representatives, @RepAdamSmith and @RepRickLarsen! It’s great working with you both!Great to welcome Jason and Elbert from Glacier Peak High School to the other Washington today! Congrats on your third place finish in @SIFMA’s 15th annual Stock Market Capitol Hill Challenge! #2018CHCawards https://t.co/pJrV0EVgYIMy heart goes out to the Marysville Pilchuck Class of 2018! I know you'll always carry Gia, Shaylee, Zoe, Andrew and Jaylen with you. 

You’ve made it. You're strong. Go out and build a better future for us all.
https://t.co/xMJkPFtuIkIn the past 15 years, #SCOTUS has issued three landmark victories that have moved our country toward one that is more fair, more equal and more inclusive of all Americans. Join me in marking June 26 as #LGBT Equality Day. #Pride2018 https://t.co/EZPFoQfS0gShame. There is no end to this Administration’s cold, heartless treatment of immigrants, especially mothers and their babies. It is immoral and un-American. https://t.co/XZfPdqRwWRJust another day at the office for @EPAScottPruitt. https://t.co/nChr2kms4CThe young people across the country, for whom the U.S. is their only home, deserve a vote, and I'll keep pushing my GOP colleagues to do the right thing to #ProtectDreamers and call for a vote on bipartisan legislation that actually addresses this crisis Trump has created.Continuing to ignore the will of the majority of Americans to support dreamers, Speaker Ryan, on his way out the door, is cynically blocking progress with a bill he knows will never become law and another that isn't even written. https://t.co/lzww7PRLWyTwo years ago, we lost 49 people in the horrific #Pulse nightmare. And we’re still here calling for change. I stand with the #LGBTQ and Latinx communities, and won’t stop pressing Congress to help #disarmhate and end gun violence. #OrlandoStrong https://t.co/Kkpgs9c4evWe should all want a peaceful resolution with North Korea. That said, we’ve seen them make vague promises before. Any agreement needs a strong, enforceable verification process, not just President Trump’s trust in a brutal dictator because they have a “special bond.”As America’s most trade dependent state, retaliatory actions on #WA's agricultural industry would have a devastating effect on our communities. I joined @davereichert in a bipartisan letter urging the Trump administration to protect our farmers. https://t.co/9gwI6YCxaXThis is a betrayal of the values our country was built on. I won't hold my breath, but it's long past time @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr stop acquiescing to the callousness of the Trump administration. https://t.co/pgivBkdOMxVoting is the bedrock of democracy. The Constitution says "the right of citizens of the U.S. to vote shall not be denied or abridged," not “use it or lose it." Today’s decision by #SCOTUS turns back the clock, but I'll continue pushing to protect voting rights for all Americans.Today, the @FCC’s repeal of open internet rules goes into effect. But now is not the time to throw in the towel. I’ll keep fighting in Congress to bring back #NetNeutrality, and if you want a free and open internet, you need to make sure your voice is heard too. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/3bWtrN58h8This is an abdication of the @EPA's responsibility and yet another example of the Trump administration's complete disregard for the government's obligation to protect the people, not corporate interests. https://t.co/NNGZiHjwH8As a mom, I can't fathom the idea of someone tearing my kids from my arms. Families seeking refuge here deserve to be treated humanely. That's why I'm standing here today w/@GovInslee, @AGOWA &amp; @NWIRP. We’re better than this, America. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/34CzPMOhhlThese graduates deserve all of our support for serving our country. And if you know someone who is interested in a service academy,have them contact my office: https://t.co/lDiQwraZQP

https://t.co/cTA55ECxvuTo be clear, this is the Trump administration refusing to defend the law of the land, and in fact, continuing to actively sabotage the #ACA in a way that will undermine comprehensive coverage and cause millions of Americans to pay more for less. https://t.co/3BbrUcyDSLWith rising temperatures &amp; sea levels and increasing acidity, our oceans are warning us of the threats that humans &amp; #climatechange pose to our ecosystems and our way of life. We need policies to address those threats now and protect the future of our planet. #WorldOceansDay https://t.co/EPgcIIu085ICYMI: I joined more than 100 of my colleagues in urging House Appropriators to stop funding the @DHSgov's cruel practice of separating families, as well as family detention. We need a humane process for those who come here seeking refuge. https://t.co/SuUVycxFPtIn what world is this acceptable? Driving a wedge between the U.S. and our allies is precisely what China and Russia want. This isolates us even more, damages our long-term interests and threatens global stability. #G7Summit https://t.co/SYdyzS6NrdGreat to check out @AdvamedUpdate’s #MedTech Showcase today to see some innovative tech and talk about my bill that would guarantee #Medicare coverage of breakthrough technologies so seniors don't have to wait for a product that may change or even save their lives. #whenitmatters https://t.co/Lc2p9PSdISAfter all of his tough rhetoric, turns out Trump is propping up bad actors like China's #ZTE, while punishing our allies and weakening our national security. https://t.co/eaiimlZ0xZWhen 50 states have different laws on #encryption, it undermines our efforts to keep people’s personal information secure. I joined @RepTedLieu in reintroducing our bipartisan #ENCRYPTAct to strengthen our national security and protect people’s privacy. https://t.co/Slj46XdA1TCalling all #WA01 students – the 2018 Congressional App Challenge has launched! Join in on the fun and learn more here: https://t.co/do1aj8Ec6b #Congress4CS https://t.co/Tdielcew5wWe have a shared responsibility to make sure seniors have access to cutting edge medical technologies and treatments. They should not have to wait forever. Read about how my new legislation would give seniors access to important breakthrough products. https://t.co/eoQAyZN9c774 years ago today, U.S. soldiers and our allies landed in Normandy to begin a campaign of liberation against tyranny. Thank you to those who served. Your courage and your sacrifices will never be forgotten. #DDayThis is what happens when you start a trade war with our allies. Actions have consequences, and #WA01 farmers should not be the collateral damage. https://t.co/V6yXyY9cwdDuring #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, let’s remember the numerous contributions those “yearning to breathe free” have made to our nation, and do the people’s work by voting on bipartisan immigration reform measures. No more excuses, @SpeakerRyan. #CelebrateImmigrants!#WA01 has plenty of National Parks and Forests, so bring them to our neck of the woods. We can always use some more peaceful giants. #WorldEnvironmentDay https://t.co/1ClL8ftd5dHey Coach Pederson, we may be #Seahawks fans, but any Super Bowl-winning Ferndale High School alum is welcome in my office! @Eagles https://t.co/gwRqntlfAVGreat to be in Monroe today to join Take The Next Step and talk about how we can work together to support our neighbors in need and build a better future for our community. https://t.co/Ntd46a0W3lWhat a day for @UW! And the work isn’t done yet! Game 1 of #WCWS championship series starts tonight. Let’s go @UWSoftball! #MightyAreTheWomen https://t.co/CVirnYsWeAToday’s decision by #SCOTUS in Masterpiece Cakeshop is why Congress must pass the #EqualityAct NOW. It’s wrong #LGBT people can still be fired, denied credit &amp; evicted simply based on who they are &amp; who they love. I won't stop fighting until everyone has equal rights. #Pride2018While #WA may still be waiting for a @NHL team, we can all cheer on Mount Vernon native, @TJOshie77, as he plays in the #StanleyCupFinals, and his dad as he battles Alzheimer's. #ALLCAPS #EndAlzheimers https://t.co/eFVEnsVZEvICYMI: For #NationalTrailsDay, the @ForestServiceNW is waiving fees at day-use recreation sites today!  Time to #getoutside and take a hike! 🌲https://t.co/HLSQ5qaWcO https://t.co/7xkPfpJFV2No matter your opinion on our nation's #immigration laws (hint: they're broken and need to be fixed), we should agree that separating kids from their parents is incredibly cruel and should not be tolerated. It must stop now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/XFCNEGwsZJToday, I #wearorange to bring attention to the fact that gun violence is taking innocent lives and tearing communities apart. Meanwhile, @SpeakerRyan and @HouseGOP continue to make excuses for doing nothing. We need commonsense solutions now. https://t.co/ZsPL0Q7jkDICYMI: I joined @ALZ_WA advocates to talk about how Congress can help support the life-saving medical research underway to #EndAlzheimers. I've been a strong proponent of continued investments in @NIH, so we can accelerate the development of life-changing treatments and cures. https://t.co/sxqWejpBUUIt's the work of organizations like @GlacierPi that get kids excited about learning and how they can contribute. Together, we can ensure the natural beauty, which we're so fortunate to be surrounded by, is protected, and we can build a better future for our rural communities.Always heartwarming to join with @GlacierPi and the #StillyValley community - thanks for having me last night! Our future will require creative, entrepreneurial leaders. And that all starts by giving our children a great education. https://t.co/jpXMEclUxhFinally, I stopped by Twin Brook Creamery, an impressive fifth-generation farm that's utilizing technology in its processes. We talked about the farm bill and how Congress can continue to support #WA's farmers and dairy producers. https://t.co/fkhRJqpdYgNext, I had the opportunity to meet with Mayor Korthuis to talk about how we can work together on the Pepin Creek Project to reduce flooding, improve habitat and ease housing shortages. https://t.co/8U2mIyHqldGreat to be up in Lynden today! First up, I visited Guru Nanak Gursikh Gurudwara to talk with members of the Sikh community about immigration and labor issues, as well as support for our aging population. https://t.co/sbRfyr3vI9It was an honor to join the Muslim Association of Puget Sound and others from around the community last night for their annual interfaith Iftar. Together, we can combat hatred and bigotry and build a community where people of all backgrounds feel welcome. #Ramadan https://t.co/17YL3zaz4qStarting a trade war w/our allies does nothing to address China’s actions to promote oversupply &amp; market manipulation. Instead, it will damage our relationships, close off markets for farmers and local businesses, jeopardize my constituents’ jobs and increase costs on consumers. https://t.co/qLXsUUycmIWhether it's in telehealth, medication management, personalization of wellness, transportation, communication or advanced home security and safety systems, we need to ensure that innovation and policy are meeting older Americans where they are. #OAM18Each May, we observe #OlderAmericansMonth. This year's theme is Engage at Every Age. It's critically important for Congress to keep older Americans in mind when crafting policy, especially as new solutions are developed that could make aging-in-place possible for more Americans. https://t.co/rwFKTC2H6QToday is 5/30/18, which is 150 days into the year that moms would need to finally earn the same amount that dads made last year. It's 2018 - long past time for policies that support all our working families - better wages, paid leave, affordable childcare and more. #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/xUSF5oXvEyI helped craft the 2014 Farm Bill, which included $200M for pilot programs based on #WA's BFET to expand job training in 10 states, including #WA, which used it to start RISE. This partisan farm bill undermines all of that, which is why I'll vote NO again if there are no changes.The @HouseGOP wants to blow up critical job training programs for people on nutrition assistance. I joined @FareStart, @FiresteelWA &amp; @SeattleGoodwill to chat with folks participating in these programs about the importance of protecting them to help people find good-paying jobs. https://t.co/ooqyJX7gcOAs a nation, we must take care for those who've risked their lives for our way of life. I met w/ my Veterans Advisory Board today to discuss their advisory report on what Congress can be doing to better serve our #veterans and ensure they are receiving the support they deserve. https://t.co/K6ULwocf0GLIVE: Great to join @newdealleaders to discuss how we should be playing a major role in shaping forward-looking trade policy that's good for our workers, strengthens our international relationships &amp; helps us compete in the global economy. #NewDEALsummit https://t.co/FNn38pFBjLOn #MemorialDay, we honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation. We remember those such as CPL Jeffrey B. Starr, a Marine from Snohomish, who died on Memorial Day in 2005 while serving his third tour of duty in Iraq. https://t.co/zOdxBJz1owICYMI: I'm pushing Congress to pass a bipartisan #farmbill that invests in #WA farmers and bolsters our #agriculture industry while protecting the 900,000 Washingtonians who receive nutrition assistance. https://t.co/m77dKt8YE6Today is #NationalWineDay, so I just want to take a moment to say - #WA wine is the best wine, no contest. Don't @ me.

Also, with more than 350 winegrowers and 900 wineries, the industry is a huge economic boon to our state. cc: @Wa_State_WineThis is heartbreaking and infuriating, especially as Trump and Sessions talk about separating more children from their parents. We have a moral obligation to protect these children, many of whom come here from dire situations, “yearning to breathe free.” https://t.co/m95rr577kuWhile @HouseGOP is focused on favors for #WallStreet, corporations &amp; wealthy donors, I’m working to expand economic opportunities for all Americans and ensure they can earn better wages and retire w/peace of mind. I’m fighting for those being left behind. https://t.co/lpAIrvqVrHGreat to meet with @WA_OIC Mike Kreidler today to talk about how #WA and Congress can work together to help ensure all Americans have access to health care coverage and services. https://t.co/g3NwBxzeZgAnyone who falls victim to physical, sexual or emotional violence in childhood deserves justice. My amendment included in the #NDAA ensures the law no longer shields some convicted child abusers from paying the full restitution they owe. https://t.co/5uLBHujOzjDuring the markup, @WaysMeansCmte offered several amendments to make real investments to help parents get the tools and the skills necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing economy. What did the GOP do? They voted them all down.Ironically, the @WaysandMeansGOP bill renames the #TANF program to the “JOBS” program, but they fail to provide even a single dollar to help parents get good paying jobs.Today, @WaysandMeansGOP passed their reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This partisan bill is just another blown opportunity to help families in need of work. https://t.co/TFRXrlNK2kIt's #WorldTurtleDay! Here’s a throwback to visiting the @SeattleAquarium to see Tucker, the turtle who was found near death off the Oregon Coast and nursed back to health. Hope he’s having the time of his life in the warmer waters down south! https://t.co/LE8hle9BQbPresident Trump just announced his latest attack on women’s access to health care. Threatening health care providers like @PPFA will have drastic consequences for millions of people across the country. #TitleX #NoGagRule https://t.co/D7TRfiUdqHAs Yogi Berra said, “it’s déjà vu all over again.” cc: @EPAScottPruitt https://t.co/lGYgHzDFk6The Puget Sound is part of the heart and soul of Western Washington's economy and culture. Great to meet with folks from home for #PugetSoundDay to talk about how we can all work together to protect the Sound and ensure future generations enjoy the quality of life we cherish now. https://t.co/0TbyErP8XxBecause of the #GOPTaxScam and Republican sabotage of the #ACA, small business owners aren’t sure they can keep providing quality affordable health insurance to employees. We should be reducing burdens on #smallbiz, not making them and their workers pay more for less. https://t.co/xhU16pLCb2Small businesses are the backbone of our local economies, but the lack of clarity and confusion in the #GOPTaxScam gives the biggest corporations new ways to game the system while #smallbiz get left behind.In order to ensure everyone has economic opportunity, we must invest in our teachers and schools to provide our kids with a high-quality public education. As @BetsyDeVosED struggled on the Hill today, Dems unveiled #ABetterDeal for Teachers and Students. https://t.co/1onKnbkbmpSeriously? Why? https://t.co/t8lPOXhDWiToday we remember an American icon and a symbol of hope to the millions of people across our country fighting for equality each and every day. #HarveyMilkDay #LGBTQ https://t.co/4ydC8jqVG4Looks like @EPAScottPruitt needs all that extra security to protect him from *checks notes* reporters covering a speech he’s giving in a federal building. 

This is the United States. The First Amendment must be respected and supported. https://t.co/oHDV0SmUHmBlatant discrimination is being encouraged by this administration’s hateful, inflammatory rhetoric, and it must stop. When did speaking Spanish become a crime? https://t.co/dU65sBqNwpI agree with #RBG's dissent - today's decision by #SCOTUS is “egregiously wrong.” While this is a setback for worker and consumer protections, I'll continue to push Congress to ensure the laws that allow their voices to be heard are crystal clear. https://t.co/esGwskMN1STo all who are observing the fast this month, #Ramadan Mubarak! https://t.co/X9vcxw0VgbICYMI: As a border district and a trade dependent state, the #NAFTA renegotiation is incredibly important for #WA01. The administration needs to start working with Congress so we can get an updated deal that's good for our workers and local businesses. https://t.co/MsTZ12ciEYICYMI: I've had the opportunity to work with @fredhutch on many occasions. There's no doubt in my mind that the investments made in the incredible work they’re doing has led to improved treatments and will lead to the cure itself. #CuresStartHere https://t.co/gc23sY08csA relief that the terrible #GOPFarmBill failed on the House floor today. Congress should be debating and working on a bipartisan bill that supports our farmers as well as the millions of families across the country who receive nutrition assistance. #ProtectSNAPIncredibly tragic news. My heart goes out to the entire community of Santa Fe, TX. Our students should feel safe at school and be celebrating the end of the year, not running for their lives. It’s past time to stop these senseless acts of violence. #enough https://t.co/XuasA337lV.@realDonaldTrump has made clear he will stop at nothing when it comes to attacking and undermining women’s health care. Make no mistake, this ideological crusade to gut #TitleX and @PPFA has one purpose - limit women’s access to care. https://t.co/LDT7oPcZ06Just in case you missed it: https://t.co/obr8ewoY3l“Our fiscal policy is very misguided, ill-conceived, and is ultimately, if not corrected, going to have damaging if not disastrous effects on our country including people’s retirement savings.” -@SteveRattner #TaxFacts https://t.co/zQkFvSNmAOI applaud the House Republicans who are standing up to @SpeakerRyan to force votes on immigration legislation. Ryan and @POTUS have made false promises to bring up a bill before, so why should they be believed now? #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/rCGNjHEGlnCongress needs to craft forward-looking policies to take advantage of new opportunities and empower American workers of all ages w/the skills they need to participate and thrive in our evolving economy. I joined @HouseNewDems today to talk about how we get to #AFutureThatWorks. https://t.co/eLNVXsj8EdOur #LGBTQ neighbors contribute to our communities despite the violence, inequality and discrimination they face because of who they are and who they love. I stand with people around the world against homophobia, transphobia and biphobia. It is time to end the hate. #IDAHOTB https://t.co/RW313sf5m5Opioid misuse affects families all across the country, including in #WA. I'm pleased the Ways and Means Committee took important steps yesterday to help stem the tide of the #opioid crisis, including two bipartisan bills I helped introduce, but there’s still more work to be done. https://t.co/XMKMS3nKyDRight now, @SenateDems are voting to #SaveTheInternet, and I'm calling on @SpeakerRyan and @HouseGOP to hold a vote on similar #NetNeutrality legislation here in the House. The fight for a free and open internet is not over. https://t.co/f4dmB4GinNAdd in minimal wage growth, rising gas prices and increasing healthcare premiums due to GOP sabotage, any hint of benefit families might have seen from the #GOPTaxScam will be wiped out, and the increasing debt will continue to impede our ability to invest in the future.The #GOPTaxScam is giving the richest corporations and individuals a windfall by adding trillions of dollars to our debt, threatening the long term health of the markets and Americans’ retirement security. https://t.co/hyjvhSkFzFA record breaking $1T in dividends and stock buybacks go to show how the #GOPTaxScam was a massive giveaway to corporations and the wealthiest, all paid for on the backs of hardworking Americans. Trickle-down economics has never worked and never will. https://t.co/6tfdRP80CoThe #FarmBill makes clear the @HouseGOP's intent isn’t to give people the skills they need to obtain good-paying jobs. It's just another attempt to slash nutrition assistance for millions of children and working families and call it “reform.” #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/92mgO4XrUIA new @EdNCES study shows nearly all teachers pay for supplies from their own pockets - an average of $479 per year. If we want what's best for our kids, it's time we support our #publicschools and #educators. https://t.co/l8NFFwkaMVRemember when the @HouseGOP wanted to eliminate the teacher's deduction in the #GOPTaxScam to help pay for a corporate tax cut? https://t.co/hwolfOk33nWe should be prioritizing funds to fix our crumbling #infrastructure now. Making smart investments would support jobs and economic growth in our communities, but @POTUS wants to do the opposite. #infrastructureweek https://t.co/6BIL2lhu1XICYMI: @AjitPaiFCC and @FCC's decision to eliminate #NetNeutrality rules allows cable companies and service providers to slow down or block the content you see. It's time Congress acts to protect the future of a free and open internet. #SaveTheNet https://t.co/huoEon4Rn0Last week it was Mulvaney at @CFPB. This week it’s @BetsyDeVosED. We need real leaders who will work to strengthen oversight that protects American students, not weaken it so their rich friends can get away with scamming them. https://t.co/fjOQeQksg4Happy #MothersDay to my mom, a strong role model who led by example and showed me that I could do anything. And happy Mother's Day to all the other moms in #WA01 too! https://t.co/xNx4QvD9OUOrcas are a crucial part of our culture and ecosystem here in the #PNW. I've helped introduce #HR1584 to end the practice of holding Orcas in captivity. Here's a touching story of the Lummi's journey to bring one back home to the #PugetSound. #Tokitae https://t.co/G3YBOloIZVWe should be working harder to protect student borrowers from predatory lending practices. Mick Mulvaney's actions at the @CFPB are a blatant attempt to side with loan sharks instead of students. #studentloan https://t.co/tqRbJ8SP1hICYMI: Read my op-ed on how the GOP #FarmBill puts millions of Americans at risk of losing nutrition assistance. We don’t need false promises or lectures from @SpeakerRyan &amp; @HouseGOP about the value of hard work. We need solutions
that work. #HandsOffSNAPI met w/@SecretaryRoss to urge the administration to focus on China's #aluminum market distorting practices instead of broad tariffs that harm responsible trade with other countries. A trade war could raise prices &amp; cost hardworking Americans their jobs. https://t.co/BWH9Jr0NBrWhile #WA has already acted to protect #NetNeutrality, Congress must act to protect a free &amp; open internet for all Americans. I'm pleased @SenateDems are forcing a vote to overturn the @FCC's harmful decision, and I support efforts in the House to do the same. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/bOSyxZd84VAwesome performance! Congratulations, @James_Paxton! #BigMapleNoNo https://t.co/mDdDJLUoCYIn celebration of #TeacherAppreciationWeek, I’m joining @RepSamGraves in introducing a resolution to recognize and honor the incredible contributions of teachers across the country.Today is #TeacherAppreciationDay! Teachers such as Brigitte from Stella Schola are doing a fantastic job educating children and helping them succeed all across #WA01. Take a moment to #ThankATeacher who has made a difference in your life! https://t.co/6Awa2B6CPKInstead of unilateral action, POTUS should have worked with Congress and our allies to build on the #JCPOA to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and foster stability, not chaos, in the Middle East. But this rash decision lacks any sort of plan to achieve those goals.President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the #JCPOA is a reckless move that undermines our credibility on the world stage, puts our national security at risk and eliminates our ability to maintain a watchful eye over Iran’s nuclear weapons program.Hey, #WA01! I'm hosting a telephone #townhall at 6PM tonight. Want to join in on the conversation? Text REPDELBENE to 828282. https://t.co/jVM77iPeO4Americans are demanding Congress act on commonsense gun laws. While no one law will prevent every instance of gun violence, there are steps we can take to save lives NOW. Bipartisan bills are out there, @SpeakerRyan, it's time to let us vote. #Fight4AFuture #EnoughIsEnoughThe recent exodus from the @EPA is further proof that @EPAScottPruitt is unqualified for his job. It’s time to #BootPruitt and find an EPA chief who will respect taxpayers and stand up for our environment. https://t.co/s1AbH7IhbeWishing everyone of Mexican heritage in #WA01 and around the country a safe and happy #CincoDeMayo! In these challenging times, let’s celebrate our diversity and the rich cultural heritage we enjoy as a nation of immigrants.I had a great time with @OverlakeSchool Social Studies students, who competed in the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution National Finals. They displayed tremendous knowledge and civic discourse during the competition. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/TrClXuGAtjThank you, Ichiro, for all you’ve done for the @Mariners and our community. One of my all-time favorite players and a true hero of Seattle! https://t.co/XEnq5aYGS7I was in Ferndale to visit @TidalVision, #TriVanTruckBody &amp; #TransitionComposites. Got to learn more about their work here in #WA01 &amp; how we can work together to expand opportunities &amp; support a climate where local businesses like these can grow &amp; create jobs. #smallbusinessweek https://t.co/baJPPqj9OyIt's always great to see students excited about learning math! Thanks to Eagleridge Elementary for giving me the opportunity today to speak with students and see them participate in #MathQuest! https://t.co/9152TbIsHMIf you own or are looking to start a small business, please feel free to contact my Bothell office or @SBAgov. The #SBA has dozens of offices in #WA to help you create, develop and finance your ideas. To find one near you, visit https://t.co/gVBOJrKclx. #SmallBusinessWeekAs a former businesswoman and entrepreneur, I know there's more we can do to advance an economic agenda that supports women, both as business owners and as workers. Because when women get the tools and the opportunity to succeed, our nation's economy is stronger.We're making progress, but many women-owned businesses still don't have equal access to economic opportunity. They're a $3T economic force and support 23M jobs. Yet, women account for just $1 of every $23 in small business lending, despite representing 30% of all small companies.Small businesses make up 98% of all employers in #WA - more than half our private-sector workforce. In Congress, I’m working to help our small businesses and local industries succeed so they can continue to grow and create good-paying jobs right here at home. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/LKvDmgeluVA big THANK YOU to all the #WA01 students who participated in this year's #CongressionalArtCompetition! So great to see all of the amazing art last night, and congrats to Nicole, a sophomore from @LakeWashHS, on winning with her ink and watercolor artwork - “Peace Within” https://t.co/dn2jVZIGeqI hosted a roundtable w/#WA01 Housing Authorities, @ccsww &amp; @snocounty at Sebastian Place to talk about how we can work to provide homes &amp; hope to all of our veterans &amp; their families, in part through the recent $1.5M in HUD-VASH grants they were awarded. https://t.co/RhBfxLHOOYCongrats to the 31 grads of @SVCCollege’s Parks Law Enforcement Academy, one of just seven @NatlParkService certified programs in the country! #WA is home to many beautiful places, and these graduates will help ensure we all enjoy them. #NationalParkWeek https://t.co/yoO3q14Ez2Since they're keeping Congress in the dark, I joined @HouseNewDems in urging @USTradeRep to strengthen worker &amp; environmental protections, level the playing field and improve market access for American workers, farmers, and businesses. #NAFTA https://t.co/co7xg4IdqVICYMI: I led a bipartisan letter this past week asking the #IRS about the technical difficulties that stymied taxpayers on #TaxDay and to explain how they’ll ensure it doesn’t happen again in the future. https://t.co/P1yTCnZd5mIn #WA, #outdoorrec generates $26B in economic activity and supports 200K jobs. I joined @RepDianaDeGette in leading a bipartisan resolution to recognize the impact #climatechange and the need for policies to protect our land and water. #NationalParkWeek https://t.co/jy5su5SfUDICYMI: Typical of this administration, @EPAScottPruitt wants to suppress science so he can gut health and environmental protections. Pruitt’s ethical violations and dangerous agenda put Americans at risk, and I'm calling for his immediate resignation. https://t.co/SYLxSnEI4jGreat to meet with @PPGNHI today! And also great to see a Spokane judge halt the Trump administration's arbitrary and capricious cuts to the @PPFA teen pregnancy prevention program. https://t.co/UsvYaP6SbX https://t.co/DU7wAj9BpAFour years later, the Flint water crisis is not over. In the richest country in the world, that is completely unacceptable. And it's not an anomaly — many communities are one mistake away from a similar crisis if we don’t act now to protect public health. #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/tBpr0nMSIpWhile I'm pleased to see a 3rd judge rule against the Trump administration’s decision to rescind #DACA, it's time for @SpeakerRyan &amp; Republicans in Congress to let us vote on the Dream Act so we can provide certainty to these young people. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/hHJ5zlPyjnAs the #SCOTUS hears arguments on Trump's #travelban, I urge my colleagues to support my #NoReligiousRegistryAct to prohibit the government from establishing or utilizing a registry for the purposes of classifying or surveilling people on the basis of religious affiliation. https://t.co/hTAgzuH0vIMy heart goes out to Toronto today. #WA01 stands in solidarity with our northern neighbors in condemning this tragedy. Violence and hatred have no place in our communities, and together we'll defeat them. #TorontoStrongPell Grants offer students the opportunity to get a college education without being saddled with endless debt. The #TrumpBudget robs them of that opportunity. We need to #standwithstudents. https://t.co/WH3NY6yId1I’m proud to know many #teachers, #firefighters and other hardworking folks who serve in local government. We can never forget about the people who help form the backbone of our communities. https://t.co/KOztWctD7VMy thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Congressman Al Swift. His dedication helped shape #WA into a better place for us all, and he will be sorely missed. https://t.co/2RbYW0Ed5IThe causes &amp; effects of #climatechange are threatening our way of life, our economy &amp; our children – not to mention the future of our planet. I often tell people that #WA01 is the most beautiful district in the country, but it's up to us to make sure it stays that way. #EarthDay https://t.co/cTq98m6beOICYMI: As the most trade dependent state, @EximBankUS is crucial to expand market access for #WA exports. I urge the Senate to act so #ExIm can get back to work preserving our jobs &amp; helping our manufacturers maintain competitiveness in the global economy. https://t.co/SfmrgAIR0OIt's long past time for Congress to act to protect medical patients, recreational users and small businesses in states that have legalized and regulated #marijuana from being prosecuted now or in the future, which is exactly what my bill, the #SMARTEnforcementAct, would do.Thirty states plus D.C. have legalized #marijuana in some form, yet possession or use for any purpose is still prohibited under the federal Controlled Substances Act, leaving every participant in the state markets — including cancer patients — at risk of prosecution.I first saw one of Granite Falls High School's ultra-efficient cars at a parade a few years back, and it’s been fun to follow their successes since. Good luck to #ShopGirls &amp; #UrbanAutos at the #shellecomarathon this weekend! Follow the live results here: https://t.co/sZWoxkPjb7Nineteen years after the horrors at Columbine, the inaction of some allows the scourge of gun violence to continue to tear apart families. But a generation of young people, having grown up in this terrible shadow, are leading us into the light. Enough is enough. It's time to act. https://t.co/fCj3Wf77ACThere was no doubt @EPAScottPruitt was unqualified for the job when he was nominated. Now, he's currently under at least SEVEN separate independent federal investigations. He must be immediately removed and held accountable for his failures at @EPA. https://t.co/pobJbM3Xl9All communities benefit from #SNAP. Each dollar invested generates $1.79 of economic activity and helps combat hunger and lift families out of poverty. I will continue pushing to #protectSNAP from the needless cuts in the #2018farmbill. https://t.co/tkW1lMn9EIAs we saw yesterday, technology is critical for any government agency to do its job effectively. And while I'm pleased the House passed my &amp; @RepMikeBishop's bill today to help modernize the IRS, we also need to properly fund it so IRS can better serve taxpayers. https://t.co/R1uzFhaSi4Instead of cancelling votes tomorrow, @SpeakerRyan should do the right thing &amp; bring up DREAM Act. It's time Congress provided certainty for Dreamers who know no home but here. They serve in our military, teach in our schools &amp; give back to our communities. #DreamersDeserveAVote https://t.co/pt3ESWGvrkMy thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family today as the whole country mourns the passing of First Lady Barbara. Her remarkable character inspired many, and her civility, dignity, and strength set the bar for the rest of us. https://t.co/Puokc9xLaGIt’s time to stop criminals from ripping off American taxpayers. I'm pleased the House passed my and @RepErikPaulsen's bill to expand the IP PIN program to proactively keep taxpayers’ personal information and hard-earned dollars safe. #TaxDay https://t.co/1oruPkGihaWe should be updating our policies so American workers have the tools they need to take advantage of the opportunities &amp; overcome the disruptions. That's why I'm crafting legislation to have @USDOL @usedgov &amp; @CommerceGov work together to forecast the contours of the new economy.We've seen many changes in the way the world works from e-commerce to advanced manufacturing, and they have created opportunities as well as disruptions. I asked @SecretaryAcosta how @USDOL is tackling the challenges facing American workers due to #automation and #AI. https://t.co/1SVjftd2I1I call on the IRS to grant extensions to anyone who is unable to pay their taxes on time through their website because of today’s failure. As a member of the Subcommittee on Oversight, I am committed to working with the IRS to find solutions.The notion that on #TaxDay – when millions of hardworking people across the country are trying to pay their taxes lawfully and on time – the IRS’ online payment system suddenly crashes, shows there’s still much work to be done in addressing this critical issue. https://t.co/xQxW2VevwfICYMI: It's time for Congress to ensure our #nationalparks have the resources they need so the public can enjoy all they have to offer. I strongly support the National Parks Service Legacy Act to help protect our #publiclands for future generations. https://t.co/7VTtatmh7sCongressional Republicans falsely sold the #GOPTaxScam as a bill for the middle class, when in reality, the wealthiest 1%  will ultimately get 83% of the benefits. They promise that the benefits will trickle down to hard working Americans, but they never do and they never will. https://t.co/vdp3NnLO2JThe #GOPTaxScam will raise taxes on 86 million middle-class Americans over 10 years, while causing Americans’ health insurance premiums to skyrocket, all to pay for $2.3 trillion in tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest. #TaxDay https://t.co/55Rt7h0abtTomorrow is #TaxDay! If you haven’t filed your taxes yet, take a look at these tips from @IRSnews to protect your identity and avoid mistakes. https://t.co/ZbluZnueUvA happy #Vaisakhi to all in #WA01 who celebrate! https://t.co/1IF8c0jugIICYMI: I agree with Commissioner @JRosenworcel. It’s long past time to bring back the #OTA to help educate Congress on critical issues that are only becoming more prevalent, and I'll continue calling on Congress to fully restore it. https://t.co/ZOMY8YhiTDI sent a bipartisan letter to @CMSGov today urging @SeemaCMS to support the shift to value-based health care and give health provider networks time to develop, reduce costs and improve #Medicare #ACOs. https://t.co/YXWoTfT3DVOur libraries provide a place where the community can come together to learn &amp; experience new things. Excited to hear about the @KCLS &amp; @Googleorg partnership to help ignite a spark in future creators at their new Bellevue #STEAM makerspace! #tbt #ideaX #NationalLibraryWeek https://t.co/SnCFylfdYYLike the #GOPTaxBill, this is a con. They don't suddenly care about deficits and debt. It's part of the plan. Increase our deficits and then use that as an excuse to shamelessly force damaging cuts to vital services such as #Medicare, #SocialSecurity and #Medicaid. https://t.co/hiBHrRyePKCan't say I'm surprised, but the @HouseGOP’s hypocrisy to call for a balanced budget amendment after exploding our deficits with nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts that mostly benefit millionaires and big corporations is staggering.I joined 47 of my colleagues in opposition to the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State. “We believe that Mr. Pompeo’s track record of opposing equal rights for the #LGBTI community, and his support for the use of torture...should disqualify him from consideration.” https://t.co/gx67mN24TtWith 40% of #WA jobs tied to trade, we're the most trade dependent state, and many of my constituents rely on open markets for their business. In Ways and Means today, I asked @SeaportNW CEO John Wolfe how the administration's trade policies may affect jobs and our local economy. https://t.co/8eb4LeRelJEvery year, millions of Americans file their tax returns, and it’s our job to ensure they're protected from enterprising criminals. My and @RepErikPaulsen's bill would protect taxpayers from tax identity theft and fraud, and I'm pleased it passed through committee today. https://t.co/I5rDQ3ITlvAnd while this bill is clearly an incredibly important step forward, there's much work to do. Let’s build on today's progress. We need to stop cutting the IRS budget and thus its effectiveness, and invest in modernizing their systems to get the job done for American taxpayers.It's long past time the IRS got rid of their fax machines &amp; '60s IT systems and entered the digital age. I joined @RepMikeBishop today in passing the 21st Century IRS Act through committee to enhance IRS security measures, keep taxpayers safe and ease burdens on small businesses. https://t.co/cPkw9hrNEGI'm pleased @HUDgov is awarding #WA housing authorities $1.5M+ to increase access to affordable housing for our #veterans. I've pushed for robust funding for the critical HUD-VASH, and I'll keep working until all our veterans get the support &amp; benefits they deserve &amp; have earned.We have an obligation to care for those who have risked their lives and made painful sacrifices for our families and our freedoms, which includes making sure all our #veterans have a safe and affordable place to call home. https://t.co/r5IdOeMbPXThe deadline for the 2018 Congressional Art Competition is this Friday!

This new funding provides a great opportunity to develop treatments &amp; cures that will improve the lives of countless people &amp; families. https://t.co/uXsXMjULDwAs a former immunology researcher, I know firsthand the importance of investing in #research. Through bipartisan work, I’ve helped secure a historic $7 billion increase in @NIH funding since joining Congress, including $3 billion in the recent omnibus spending bill. https://t.co/c7oS4txVanICYMI: It's the natural environment that surrounds us is that makes living in the #PNW so special. If you enjoy hiking and taking in the beautiful #WA01, take a moment to weigh in on proposed improvements to Pacific Northwest Trail. https://t.co/f5Fk532d0uI joined @RepDonBeyer and @RepCicilline in urging @POTUS to fire @EPAScottPruitt for unethical behavior, wasteful use of taxpayer money, and numerous actions that contravene the @EPA’s mission. https://t.co/K3GTOIJnC2 https://t.co/cnxpWX7PB4I toured the incredible @GIX_edu campus today to learn more about how they're bringing universities and companies together to come up with bold solutions to complex challenges. https://t.co/Rr4DezxHSGAlways a pleasure to chat with @UWBothell students and staff! Thank you for joining me today to share your ideas and concerns for our future. https://t.co/8drOuWFxC1I joined @PSETalk yesterday to see their Baker River Hydroelectric Project and talk about ways to continue developing clean and renewable energy while also ensuring we're doing all we can to protect salmon and conserve our natural environment. https://t.co/Bndg5YepDKI visited #PACCAR's technical center today to talk with their staff about the process of designing, manufacturing and testing their trucks and engines. And got to take a @KenworthTruckCo and a @PeterbiltMotors out for a spin! https://t.co/aKIYVIMhhPRev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. helped start a movement to combat inequality, and that progress didn't end with his death. But there's much work left to do, so today, 50 years on, we keep marching until we have an equal society for all. #goodtrouble #MLK50 https://t.co/H2wmGvIXVrMaking sure everyone has a safe and affordable place to call home is a moral imperative that we must keep working to address, and can only be solved with the close coordination of local, state, and federal government, and I'm committed to doing my part.That's why I joined low income housing residents, @ImagineHousing and @ccsww today, to hear directly from them about what we can do to work together and build on that success.Working with @SenatorCantwell, I’m proud we’ve secured the first expansion of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program in a decade. This important program has demonstrated success in delivering affordable housing to American families, but it's only a first step. https://t.co/hKJczdE80sIt was great to talk with members of the #Woodinville Rotary today! Thank you for sharing what you believe Congress should prioritize and focus on for the rest of the year. https://t.co/HnnC7m0AjMHappy Easter, #WA01!Thank you to everyone who came out to share your thoughts at my community forums in Duvall and Carnation today! I appreciate hearing from you. https://t.co/QL9pEUmbnCA happy Pesach and a blessed Good Friday to all in #WA01 that observe.Addiction is a disease, not a crime, and no one plans to be homeless. Too many families in #WA &amp; across the country are struggling. Congress must do more to support successful diversion programs &amp; ensure everyone has a safe &amp; affordable place to call home. https://t.co/bewkcRCBMrI joined @SnoCoSheriff Sgt. Huri for a ride-along today from the Diversion Center to Monroe to see firsthand how our LEOs are directly engaging with our community to combat homelessness and addiction. https://t.co/S67H6VctcnGreat to meet with the inaugural class of @WSUMedicine students today to hear about why they want to become physicians and the impact they hope to have on the future of medicine and healthcare. https://t.co/22FiM3OnZKMy, oh my, it's #OpeningDay Let's go, @Mariners! https://t.co/zbtotrKGs8Always a pleasure to visit @bgcskagit to see the great work they do for the kids in our community! And truly an honor to be named a Congressional Champion. I'll keep fighting for the kids in #WA01 and the programs that give them the opportunities to reach their full potential. https://t.co/rBMrzy0DikThank you to the students of Mount Vernon High School for spending some time today to share your thoughts with me! You are an inspiration. Stay active and engaged, and you will change our future. https://t.co/VeP7mCe7vTAs we mark #NationalVietnamWarVeteransDay, I joined @vietnamwar50th in thanking and honoring #WA Vietnam War veterans during a pinning ceremony to recognize their service and sacrifices. https://t.co/Fb7aV1otYQI toured Mid-Mountain Materials with @ImpactWA today to talk about how apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs can ensure we have the skilled workforce we need for the future and connect hard-working Americans with good manufacturing jobs in #WA. https://t.co/lnFeUuBBZ6Access to nutritious meals is an absolute necessity, and it's shameful that some of my colleagues are talking about cutting vital nutrition programs. Instead, we should work on reducing hunger and helping people become self-sufficient by finding good-paying, long-term employment.I had the opportunity to join volunteers at the Granite Falls Community Coalition food bank today. A big THANK YOU for all of the hard work they do to provide healthy food to those in our community who are struggling. No one should have to go hungry. https://t.co/NkrZ1nBq7mI chose to enter politics to help ensure everyone has access to basic needs &amp; an opportunity to provide for their family. And while my legislation to expand #LIHTC was in the omnibus, there's more we can do to lift families out of poverty &amp; increase access to affordable housing.Organizations like @MarysPlaceWA are doing incredible work providing homeless women and children with a safe community to get back on their feet. No parent wants to be in a position where they can’t provide shelter for their family. https://t.co/HwNDfEJKkK.@WashingtonTrade knows starting #tradewars with our partners isn’t the answer and will only cause more chaos and confusion in the markets, costing Americans good-paying jobs. We need targeted enforcement of our trade agreements to address the real challenges we face. https://t.co/xgMmhqCTkiIt was great to hear about @Accenture’s #apprenticeship program, helping ensure we have workers ready for 21st century jobs! https://t.co/BZHrvlNlM0To all the students, parents, faculty, staff and everyone out there today, I’m with you, I hear you, and I won’t stop pushing for commonsense reforms to stop the scourge of gun violence in our communities. #EnoughIsEnough #NeverAgain https://t.co/ReCCEUjyRUSorry I missed you all! But thank you for also coming to my D.C. office to share your stories and for representing MPHS, the Tulalip Tribe and #WA01 so well. You all give me hope for our future. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/6ATKtxQ8ESIt’s long past time for Republicans to stop sabotaging the ACA and start working across the aisle on solutions that help build on the progress we’ve made to bring down healthcare costs and provide stability for individuals and families. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/BasELvCNbBToo often, we forget that #healthcare is about more than numbers. It’s about real people. Eight years ago, the ACA became law, allowing millions of Americans to finally gain coverage. We can't go back to a time when getting sick meant going bankrupt. https://t.co/Iz7IXLwc4qThis was a compromise and I’m disappointed bipartisan proposals like the #DREAM Act were not included. There is no reason Congress shouldn’t act on this immediately.That said, this comes six months into the fiscal year. Short-term, crisis-driven legislating is the most expensive and least efficient way to budget, and it keeps us from working on other priorities we need to address for our nation’s future.While not perfect, I'm pleased the funding bill includes priorities I've been working on such as @NIH funding, funding to combat #opioids, investments in #infrastructure, and my bill to increase access to low-income housing.Lawmakers must do more to ensure we fund resources &amp; research efforts to prevent future landslides from becoming national tragedies. That's why I introduced the bipartisan National Landslide Preparedness Act to help communities better prepare for when landslides occur. #OsoStrongToday is the fourth anniversary of the tragic #Oso landslide, which in an instant took the lives of 43 of our neighbors. This community will always be near and dear to my heart. https://t.co/W3T4nHavRvHey, King County! I want to hear from you. I'll be hosting two community forums in Duvall and Carnation on 3/31, so come on out and join me! https://t.co/9DxKVH8pBtWashington’s small businesses make up 98% of all employers in the state – and more than half of the state’s private-sector workforce. By working together with organizations like @wsbdc, we can help our small businesses succeed and encourage sustained economic growth. #sbdcdayICYMI: The Trump administration’s reckless decision to end the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program is another attack on women's health education driven by Republicans' rigid ideology over scientific progress and evidence-based policy.  https://t.co/rWYKqWDQacThis is what democracy looks like. Proud that #WA is taking steps to get dark money out of politics and make it easier for the people's voices to be heard. Now it's time for Congress do the same. https://t.co/hkYAwxXp9SAs home to 3,000+ farms, #WA01 farmers produce some of the best berries and dairy. I'm pushing for programs that support specialty and organic crops, cutting edge research, conservation and access to markets around the world so our #agriculture industry thrives. #NationalAgDay https://t.co/OfYpV2ekE9ICYMI: I joined @RepAdamSchiff and @RepPeterDeFazio in calling for investments in #earthquake early warning systems to help save lives and protect our critical infrastructure and utilities to keep future natural disasters from becoming national tragedies. https://t.co/tJ6vYTIgWBHappy Birthday, Zach! You may be older, but I can still see that little boy. Love you! https://t.co/mwhUlurh2qCalling all #WA01 high school students! The 2018 Congressional Art Competition is in full swing. Due date is April 13. Learn more here: https://t.co/Xk07w3qOPC @conginst.@su_wbb has already made history, time to make some more! Let’s go Redhawks! #TogetherWeSoar https://t.co/Zd9KkDukz7My heart goes out to the family of Congresswoman @louiseslaughter. A dedicated advocate for our nation’s values, her voice and presence will be deeply missed.ICYMI: The Darrington Youth Coalition visited D.C. to learn more about how they can help lead their community in combating the #opioid epidemic and preventing alcohol and drug abuse. @EverettHerald https://t.co/2HzaxWQn2qReal #taxreform would have ended this cycle of retroactive extensions and jockeying over uncertain tax policies. Congress shouldn't pick winners and losers, but should strive for a tax code that finally provides certainty to taxpayers so they can plan for the future.Last year, I hoped we’d have a serious conversation on reforming the tax code in a way that gives every American the opportunity to succeed. That didn't happen. To be clear, the #GOPTaxScam was a giveaway to corporations, not real tax reform that supports hardworking families. https://t.co/LLgZ0KemrlI join students across the country in calling on Congress to act now to help #EndGunViolence. It's powerful to see so many young people getting involved and leading the national discussion. They are our future, and the future looks bright. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/9PmiOZjJ21Saddened to hear of the passing of Dr. Stephen Hawking. The world is forever grateful for his astounding contributions to physics, as well as the hope and inspiration he instilled in many.  https://t.co/1YXL24UA6ZI’m joining @vietnamwar50th to thank and honor #Vietnam veterans and their families. If you or a family member are eligible and would like a Vietnam Veteran lapel pin, join me in Mount Vernon on 3/29..@SpeakerRyan should let us vote on, at the very least, bipartisan bills to strengthen background checks and end the ban on federally funded research. But I want to hear from you too - what should Congress do to end #gunviolence? 

Share your thoughts:Happy Birthday, @GirlScouts! As an alumna, thanks for all of your great work building girls of courage, confidence and character over the past 106 years. Here's to many more years of inspiring future leaders! #GIRLagenda #GirlScoutsDayAs the 2nd largest market for a nearly $10 billion illegal trade in endangered wildlife products, we have an obligation to end illegal trafficking. Reversing this ban sends a terrible message to the rest of the world, and undermines important progress we've made over the years.ICYMI: I firmly believe that threatened or endangered species should not be killed for sport. So it was incredibly disappointing that the Trump administration decided last week to repeal a ban on importing elephant trophies into the U.S. https://t.co/JzUReElGpoDuring #WomensHistoryMonth, we celebrate the incredible achievements of the women who have helped shape history. And each March 8th, we celebrate #InternationalWomensDay to honor the women making #HERstory now and inspire those who will build on our progress in the future. https://t.co/uE4Z6WdekrAs co-chair of the Kidney Caucus and a member of the Caucus for Women’s Issues, I joined the @KidneyFund today in their efforts to educate Congress on women and kidney disease and what we can do to help. #WorldKidneyDay #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/MJ2e9Ct66nWelcome home, Ichiro! https://t.co/dMpJPm1Oz1When people join together and speak freely, they can effect change that makes our country stronger and better for the next generation. As we mark the anniversary of #bloodysunday, we reaffirm our commitment to continue the fight for equal rights for everyone. #goodtrouble https://t.co/n9BOJa5TDvICYMI: Members on both sides of the aisle agree, there is a problem, but starting a trade war with our responsible partners is not the answer. Doing so will cost #WA jobs and raise prices on consumers.Oil drilling off the Pacific Northwest coastline poses a devastating threat to the fishing, shellfish and tourism industries at the heart of our state’s economy. I’ll continue to work with my #WA and #OR colleagues to #ProtectOurCoast. https://t.co/8e8myVtiL1Congratulations to Redmond High School for winning their regional and advancing to the National Finals of the @DOE_SC_NSB National Science Bowl! #NSB2018 @lakewashschools https://t.co/iJ4ShtOLUI https://t.co/whLIhIEekyI joined my #WA Democratic colleagues in calling on House leadership to bring up a permanent solution for #DACA, so #DREAMers can carry on their contributions to our country without fear. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/JppjtcsstzThanks to all of the #WA01 farmers who came out to @CravenFarm in Snohomish today! I appreciate hearing from you. Working together, we can create sound #agriculture and food policy that lets us plan for the future. https://t.co/K140DoVBRsI joined @Facebook, @NAWBONational and @OneRedmond for a Boost Your Business seminar to talk about how we can help #smallbusinesses succeed. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/fTMTxHBLo9It’s inspiring to see so many young people excited and engaged to make our community and country a better place. A big thank you to Mr. Hayman and his AP Government students for the great discussion today! @lssd https://t.co/fLP2AugKjYOur natural environment is what makes living in the Pacific Northwest so special. Conservation and preservation are critical to preserving the quality of life we cherish, and I'll continue to fight so future generations can enjoy the #PNW as we do today. https://t.co/FSFEe9LHQMThis terrible proposal from @BetsyDeVosED and the Trump administration would harm student borrowers and override states like #WA who are trying to protect them. We should be supporting students, not predatory lending practices. @markets https://t.co/EJiJPpGM9YGreat to see #WA leading the way to restore #netneutrality protections! It's time for Congress to do the same and pass @USRepMikeDoyle's bill to #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/nQJv2Mp52KThanks for having me to talk about how we can lead in promoting 21st century trade policies! https://t.co/V2s0aBYYVeI am joining colleagues in signing on to a discharge petition to force @SpeakerRyan and @HouseGOP leadership to hold a vote on bipartisan legislation I've cosponsored to strengthen #NICS &amp; improve background checks. We need 216. Has your Rep signed on? https://t.co/a2wAveykYrI am fighting for a free and open internet. That’s why I joined @USRepMikeDoyle and more than 140 colleagues in introducing legislation to help #SaveTheInternet by overturning the @FCC’s repeal of #netneutrality. https://t.co/BLHBj9K3sICongress must update our laws by passing the #CLOUDAct. It’s important all sides come together around a solution that gives technology users confidence their #privacy rights are protected while ensuring law enforcement agencies have access to information needed to keep us safe. https://t.co/jh3oIRp2wPAs lawmakers, we have a responsibility to protect our communities. Now, not after the next tragedy, is the time for Congress to act to end the epidemic of #gunviolence. That's why I joined @RepCicilline and @RepTedDeutch today to introduce the Assault Weapons Ban. #NeverAgainFrom better wages and benefits to safer working conditions and more reasonable hours, organized labor has secured many key victories for middle-class families. I'll keep fighting to defend collective bargaining rights and prevent further erosion of the middle-class. #WeRiseCalling all #WA01 teachers! Apply by 3/1 to attend a free @NEHgov summer professional development program! Sites across the country are ready to share their history with you and your students. https://t.co/SFlrS1VvvBICYMI: President Trump’s proposal to cut $213 billion from nutrition programs is unacceptable. We should be working to ensure these programs are preserved to expand economic opportunity by helping people find good-paying, long-term employment. https://t.co/Qe0RSoNnMUHappy 286th Birthday to the father of our country and the namesake of our state! https://t.co/22kfvRTuNwI toured the Technology Development Center with @PortBellingham, @WWU, @BhamTechCollege &amp; @TheFoundryWA to discuss the importance of applied research &amp; technical training to ensure we have the skilled workforce needed to keep making some of the world's best products here in #WA. https://t.co/ZoTbrjvLwgGreat to see the work @iTekenergy is doing here in #WA. To preserve our way of life and grow our economy, we need to take control of our energy future. Clean energy tech creates jobs, reduces costs, strengthens our national security and improves our standard of living. https://t.co/AAPFhFREzsThanks to everyone who took the time to chat with me this morning at the Canyon Park – Park and Ride. I really appreciate hearing from you! https://t.co/MyHoOlKN12As your representative in Congress, one of the most important aspects of my job is to stay informed of the thoughts and opinions of my constituents. Join me tomorrow morning at 7:00 for #CongressOnYourCorner at the Canyon Park - Park and Ride. https://t.co/wjqcgjsUelICYMI: Lawmakers need to ensure we fund resources and research efforts to prevent future natural disasters from becoming national tragedies. My legislation boosts scientific progress and helps communities better prepare for when landslides do occur. https://t.co/2NZyfpjg5eThe Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program educates teens on sexual harassment prevention, healthy relationships, delaying sex and protection against HIV/AIDS. The administration ending these grants does nothing to support good health among our youth. @PPGNHI https://t.co/pxz1MA8UGzAnd does he really think these investors will fund critical, but less lucrative projects in rural communities like Concrete or Darrington, and others like them across the country that need these infrastructure investments to support farmers, families and small businesses?I asked @USTreasury Secretary Mnuchin about his comments that the administration’s #infrastructure plan will depend on foreign investment. Why would we allow foreign investors to charge us to use our roads and bridges? https://t.co/nGaqXwcizVI asked @USTreasury Secretary Mnuchin about bipartisan legislation I helped introduce to level the playing field for local brick and mortar businesses throughout our country. For too long, they have been at an unfair competitive disadvantage to out of state online retailers. https://t.co/pKU1oLDCElDavid is right, "without action, ideas stay ideas and children die." Congress has plenty of ideas w/bipartisan support: 
-federally funded research on gun violence
-background checks on all sales
-banning bump stocks.
Now, not the next tragedy, is the time to act. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/RbvAkRkZJUTerrible news out of Florida. My heart goes out to the students and their families and my thoughts are with all the first responders. No one should fear going to school.The reckless #TrumpBudget guts funding for basic necessities like healthcare, nutrition, housing and education by striping care from seniors, food from children and higher ed opportunities from working families. We need a bipartisan plan that truly reflects America’s values. https://t.co/H8tQBJQDmJThe reckless #TrumpBudget would strip healthcare from seniors by cutting #Medicare, #Medicaid and relies on misleading math, not real dollars, for medical research at @NIH. I asked @SecAzar why. https://t.co/9flfSzv17VThe reckless #TrumpBudget slashes $213B from #SNAP &amp; changes part of it to an ill-conceived  "Blue Apron-type program” (although BA has fresh food - this wouldn't). I ran out of time with @MickMulvaneyOMB, but plenty of questions still need answering. https://t.co/E1e3rq9TJN https://t.co/UGLfeDxZ6c.@JoeBiden's dad is right. "Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value." The #TrumpBudget is a terrible deal for our country. https://t.co/u6ZGnWYxJTImproving our #infrastructure is bipartisan, and we should be able to come to an agreement that emphasizes need, not profit potential. https://t.co/UAUDAny4PbThe President's #infrastructure plan fails to provide adequate funding to get the job done. An echo of the #GOPTaxBill, it is designed to benefit wealthy investors, leaving behind communities that have critical needs but few matching dollars.I had a great time joining students from Rose Hill and Benjamin Rush elementary schools today crafting #ValentinesForVets to thank the brave men and women for their service. https://t.co/0ZcfBs9vjYGood meeting with Mayor @jmarchione9 today to talk about how we can work together to expand economic opportunity in Redmond and throughout #WA01. https://t.co/5SBgjybRkkIt is appalling that the Trump administration plans to let states terminate @PPFA as a healthcare provider for people on #Medicaid. We should be improving access to medical services to more people, not making it harder for those who need it most. https://t.co/A9EZak9Ew9I met with @SkagitGov and Western Washington Agricultural Association today to talk about the importance of investments in agricultural #infrastructure projects for #WA01 #farmers. https://t.co/DKasJ1rpZBI joined Commissioner Janicki, Mayor Johnson and Cascades Job Corps at Helping Hands Food Bank today. No child should have to go hungry, and it’s shameful that some of my colleagues want to cut vital #nutrition assistance programs. #Food4Kids https://t.co/tH6ofX6ydA#OTD, the 2014 Farm Bill was signed. As we look ahead to the 2018 #FarmBill, I'll continue advocating for #WA01 farmers and producers. We should build on support for specialty and #organic crops, cutting edge research, #conservation of our forests and #nutrition assistance. https://t.co/K1EpyML2WII helped introduce the bipartisan #CLOUDAct with @RepDougCollins to update our electronic #privacy laws. The bill gives technology users confidence that their privacy rights will be protected while providing a clear legal framework for law enforcement. 
https://t.co/gP1zJhxOLlI joined @SenatorCantwell and other #PNW lawmakers on a bipartisan letter to @SecretaryZinke expressing our opposition to oil drilling along our coasts. https://t.co/vpiKbYxa80The #FMLA was the first step toward giving workers the security to succeed both at work and home. But workers shouldn't have to choose between their health or keeping their paychecks. It's time to act to ensure working families are healthy and financially stable. #FMLA25 https://t.co/EcGswDTzvrGreat to hear from #WA01 farmers today! It's an honor to represent a district with a thriving #agriculture industry, with more than 3,000 farms that produce some of the best berries, dairy and more. https://t.co/0aQKLahsmQI met with @CaseyPrograms today to talk about #FosterCare and the importance of working together to ensure all young people have the opportunity to achieve their dreams. https://t.co/jysfPF1hFTICYMI: “All of the programs [the President] talked about, the opioid crisis or infrastructure, important programs that we need to support, but it takes money to do that and we have a government that is only operating a few weeks at a time right now." @KUOW https://t.co/w0ffu9v14bIt was great to join Ms. Tennis and her 8th grade class at #StellaSchola today! Education is the foundation of our kid's success, and we have the responsibility to ensure every child has access to a high-quality education, no matter where they live or how much their family makes. https://t.co/YbL8pjlFrhIn case there was any question about why we're standing together to say #TimesUp. https://t.co/zzyNEb2oJAI joined @GallupHigherEd's panel discussion today on the disruptions of #AI on the workforce and implications for higher education. Congress needs to be forward-looking when crafting policies to help ensure Americans have the skills they need to succeed in the #futureofwork. https://t.co/93gWuRixD2Relieved to hear my colleagues are all okay. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those in the vehicle.My goal in Congress is to bring people together to find #bipartisan solutions to our nation’s problems. While at #SOTU, @POTUS makes claims he wants to meet in the middle but his actions of the past year have shown that’s far from true. Let’s make America bipartisan again.It has become crystal clear that sexual harassment is rampant throughout all industries in our country. So to show solidarity with all workers who have experienced sexual harassment, I’m wearing black to the #SOTU and saying #TimesUP. #SOTUBLACKOUT https://t.co/cutVORNNzENine years ago, we made progress when President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. But women still make only 79 cents to every dollar our male counterparts earn. We must continue the call for #equalpay for equal work.It was great speaking with @NPR’s @Yukinoguchi about the future of work, portable benefits and my bill, the Portable Benefits for Independent Workers Pilot Program Act. Our economy is changing and our laws and policies have not caught up with the way the economy works today. https://t.co/DFqvbl6jXbOne year ago, I joined thousands at airports across the nation in response to Trump's reckless #muslimban. I introduced the #NoReligiousRegistryAct because intolerance &amp; hatred have no place in our society, and I won’t stop fighting for the constitutional rights of all Americans. https://t.co/bpZBk5DgY8ICYMI: Read my op-ed on the need for a renegotiated #NAFTA, and future trade deals, to reflect the thriving 21st century digital economy and ensure information can flow freely across national borders and intellectual property will be strongly protected. https://t.co/X0i78EvasUCongress needs to do more to stop the flow of illegal #opioids into our country.

Next year will be the one! #EdgarHOFAn efficient and functioning #infrastructure system is critical to#WA01 families and businesses.
