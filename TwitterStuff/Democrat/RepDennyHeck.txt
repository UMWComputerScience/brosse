Today, and all days, #FamiliesBelongTogether.More than 10,000 people have been killed in Eastern Europe since the 2014 invasion of Crimea and Russia wants to further destabilize the region by building an oil pipeline. The U.S. should act to stop Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. https://t.co/ZoofIseQQqUnlike some leaders, I'm interested in doing more listening here than tweeting. Who do you recommend I follow? Please reply with your suggestions!Folks from home send me mail. I respond to every inquiry, and sometimes I like to share the Q&amp;A with all of you. Wendy from Olympia reached out to me about HUD rent increases: https://t.co/jYk9tPlQ2IHundreds of you have reached out, and I've listened. I share your outrage about the family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/hHGGehbbELCongress can and should do more to protect our southern resident orca population, which is down to just 75 whales. Let's build awareness nationally before we lose more of these iconic NW creatures. #NationalOrcaProtectionMonth https://t.co/blJRLbwceNThis past January I talked about why unions are so important to our country on the House floor. It was true then, it's true today. #Janus https://t.co/6BvCFdnaFDI agree with the @NRDC: The Janus ruling harms us all. https://t.co/StMxEMERmx #JanusWell, this is not the end. Democrats have got a #BetterDeal for working people. Check it out here: https://t.co/ARjurzDuISAccording to @BLS_gov, union workers employed by state government in the U.S. earn on average 17 percent more than their non-union counterparts, and union workers employed by a local government in the U.S. earn 35 percent more than their non-union counterparts.According to @equitablegrowth, from 1980 to 2014, wages for the bottom half of income earners grew by one percent, while wages for the top one percent of earners grew by 205 percent.The Supreme Court’s ruling in Janus v. AFSCME will affect 17.3 million public employees, including public school teachers, firefighters, and police officers.I continue to ask those in power, when does America get a raise? As housing, health care, and everyday costs of living skyrocket, we need to do all we can to empower workers and allow them the tools to earn fair pay and benefits.In fact, we need to find ways we can attract more talent to replace a rapidly retiring public sector workforce.When our courts make it harder for workers to advocate for fair working conditions, they hurt our public sector’s ability to attract talent. That will end up harming all of us.This Supreme Court decision accepts the flawed position of special interests with deep pockets who are dedicated to destroying organized labor.Unions will continue to defend the rights of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and all public sector workers who serve our communities with courage and bravery every day.Our district is strong and prosperous because of the public servants who educate our children, put out fires, and patrol our streets.I know because I was raised in a union family, and would not be where I am today without the unions of which my parents were proud members.Throughout our history, the strong voice of unions has served as a critical part of growing our economy and middle class. #JANUSvsAFSCME13 states have multiple voting rights violations over the past 25 years – the Voting Rights Advancement Act would ensure that they don’t enact any more election changes which are unfair to voters #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/rVe0vgOzHNThere’s nothing more important than our right to vote. But 5 years after Shelby County v. Holder, that right is under attack because of gerrymandering, voter ID laws, voter purges and more.

I stand committed to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance solutions that prevent addiction and invest in treatment for those who need help.Track down expired or unwanted medication lying around the house, and drop them off at your nearest prescription take back location. To find a location near you, visit https://t.co/qtkcHe5mbHOne simple step to reduce the risk of opioid abuse in our community is properly disposing of old or unwanted opioid medications. Chances are if you can find these drugs in your medicine cabinet, your children, a friend, or a family member can stumble onto them just as easily.Refugees make our nation stronger. That's why I'm proud to cosponsor H.Res. 395, on #WorldRefugeeDay. https://t.co/4ZgBgjLbGnAccording to reporting of @McClatchyDC, buyers tied to Russia, former Soviet republics paid $109 million cash for Trump properties. https://t.co/TbQqKLzEdPOn #WorldRefugeeDay, I'm proud to support @RepTedLieu and @RosLehtinen's bill, H.Res 395, to reaffirm U.S. commitment to protect refugees. #RefugeesWelcome https://t.co/Wed3mw3FOCHouse Intel Dems are still investigating Russian interference, and the Russians are still interfering.

It's so powerful to see a community come together like this: https://t.co/yVQ4WTe99oThere is no era in American history where we have looked back at separating families as necessary and just.

This decision will create an increasingly unstable world. This Administration has let down our allies and put our safety in extreme jeopardy. #IranDealThis move will also hurt the politically moderate movement in Iran, and empower the hardliners who are against working with the West. They will point to today as a reason never to trust the United States as a serious negotiator.  #IranDealWithout this agreement, we have no way to stop Russia from returning it to Iran who could use it to develop nuclear warheads, or Russia could use their possession of it to force us to make concessions in other foreign policy matters. #IranDealFor example, Russia has 25,000 lbs of low-enriched uranium they received from Iran as part of the JCPOA implementation. This ensured that Iran no longer had the resources to manufacture a nuclear weapon. #IranDealIf this deal falls apart, the consequences will be numerous. #IranDealThe Iran nuclear agreement has successfully blocked Iran from developing or obtaining nuclear weapons. Not only does our violation of the agreement damage the credibility of the United States, but walking away will also make use less safe. #IranDealThe decision to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census will have long-lasting consequences for cities &amp; states and jeopardizes the disbursement of funding for essential services for everyone. https://t.co/ndMp3d0yB9Including a citizenship question in the #2020Census only serves to suppress participation &amp; will result in inaccurate data that does not reflect the makeup of our nation. https://t.co/IdSHxLRFZGOur economy depends on dedicated educators who prepare our students for the workforce and inspire them to pursue their dreams.

More must be done. https://t.co/Wz1WSX0UQhMore economic sanctions against the key oligarchs can help curtail this effort to attack our democracy.  Squeezing their wallets puts the squeeze on Putin.People are being killed. President Trump should focus his ire on Putin, and apply more economic pressure to this oppressive regime which continues to threaten the U.S. and our allies.Sanctioning the Russian oligarchs who are connected to organize crime  and help finance these criminal acts on Putin’s behalf is becoming increasingly urgent.This is really only step one of many necessary steps to demonstrate that we are serious about their movements to attack Western democracies.The expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S., including from the Russian consulate in Seattle, is the right move but President Trump can and should do more to dissuade further Russian aggression.  https://t.co/8sGBTubQ1NInterested in applying to a U.S. service academy? https://t.co/V2HKJqL8BbI know the ACA is not perfect.

Listen to my constituents who have benefited under this landmark law. Listen to Sherry from Olympia: https://t.co/BZDKIfsPrBSince the ACA became law, over 20 million Americans have been able to access coverage. https://t.co/PLtnqinZw2The ACA made preventative care and birth control free, and banned insurers from discriminating against pre-existing conditions, selling junk insurance, or enacting lifetime limits. https://t.co/vd7M3yzukFEight years ago today, the Affordable Care Act became law. https://t.co/Zm2dOxeN7aCongrats to #WA10 manufacturer @AlaffiaSkinCare on the nationwide expansion of their retail network!
