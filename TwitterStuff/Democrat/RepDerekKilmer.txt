Yesterday, I visited w/ 22 women at the NW Detention Center who haven’t been with their kids in weeks. This is wrong. Congress needs to vote on bipartisan immigration reform, and the president needs to reunite families right away. #FamiliesBelongTogther

https://t.co/WlCU1qNn39Thanks for meeting with me and for the work you do in our community. https://t.co/PumCCrriK8HAPPENING NOW: I'm having a conversation with some of the folks who are helping our friends and neighbors battling #opioid addiction and leading the effort to address this public health crisis. We are on Facebook Live. You can tune in here📺: https://t.co/3tlMJgQm6pToday's vote tally 121 for &amp; 301 against the #immigration bill was a bipartisan rejection of a compromise between the far right and very far right. I'm for protecting our border, reforming the system and certainty for dreamers. That's why I'm for the bipartisan #USAAct.Today w/ @CongressmanGT @SenAmyKlobuchar @sensasse &amp; a bipartisan group of lawmakers, I introduced the Skills Investment Act of 2018. It creates lifelong learning accounts. Workers can use these tax-advantaged savings accounts to learn new skills &amp; thrive in our changing economy.Public unions fight for better pay, fair working hours and safe workplaces. That benefits every worker.  #Janus #union https://t.co/zZ6hku5ggqI’m disappointed by today’s Supreme Court decision to uphold the travel ban. This is bad policy that Congress needs to fix. #SCOTUSCongress should make it easier to participate in our democracy, not harder. On the 5th anniversary of Shelby County v. Holder, Congress should protect and expand the right to vote by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act. #RestoreTheVoteUpdate #3: I was unable to meet with any parents today but will keep trying. ICE has offered a tour later this week and I will return. In the meantime, I’ll keep fighting for our American values. #familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/vK0pX5IoygUpdate #2: The Presidents exec order did not reunite separated families. It’s difficult just to visit them. The challenge of reuniting families will be immense. Especially for young children who can’t communicate. #familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/ekzclIfu61I was scheduled to inspect the NW Detention Center and meet w/ parents separated from their children today. ICE cancelled the tour, but I'm going to try to meet parents during visiting hours. #familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/qiSoblrEsiI am sad to learn that Natalie Bryson, a leader in the Kitsap community, my friend and a mentor has passed on. Last week I sent her a special message from the floor of the House, and I wanted to share it in tribute to her today. https://t.co/HykhOWObA3The #LWCF has built parks in places like Tacoma and protected forestland and shellfish beds in Kitsap and Mason Counties. The LWCF's 600 projects in our region support WA's $1.6bn outdoor economy, and thousands of jobs. Congress must prevent it from expiring in 100 days.Today the House passed a deeply partisan #FarmBill, the same exact one it failed to pass in May. The Farm Bill is supposed to be about people, but this bill is not. I spoke out against it in May, and it is just as bad now as it was then. https://t.co/hwybgvczn8We are a nation of laws, and we're also a nation of immigrants. Today I spoke with @KUOW's @billradkeradio about the President's family separation policy, the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct and the bipartisan path forward on immigration. https://t.co/sGvpKjpsiGToday I'm joining 190 Members of Congress to introduce the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to push back on the President's and @DHSgov's cruel family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether .#KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/ltbPLA1EqJThis is awful. And it’s just plain wrong. 

Make no mistake about it: the President has the power to stop separating families immediately. He should do that. And then he should work with both parties in Congress to pass comprehensive #immigration reform. 

https://t.co/h60gP7ROaaIf it’s Father’s Day that can only mean one thing — the Manchester Salmon Bake.  Tess and I were on cookie duty this year.  Thanks to everyone who came out to support the local library.   Happy Father’s Day!  #fathersday https://t.co/9bEWLRiJ5qTonight, I am giving thanks for the chance to represent our region and all of the people who make it home. From my family to everybody celebrating together with their friends and family tonight, Eid Mubarak. 

#EidMubarakThanks to the Army Corps of Engineers for this important #infrastructure investment in Grays Harbor. https://t.co/GHhZ5ypXFlIt all makes sense now, except one thing: can someone (maybe 
@HamillHimself) explain what the whole midi-chlorians thing was about? 
https://t.co/3YW48opARMAppointed officials at the FCC shouldnt be setting the rules on  #netneutrality, members of Congress who are accountable to the people should be. Last time Congress passed a major telecom bill (1996) they probably had to watch a VHS on how to use Netscape. Time for telecom reform https://t.co/v32ljbo1jQYesterday I met with Housing Resources Bainbridge and Helpline. America's shortage of affordable #housing fuels a whole bunch of other policy issues from homelessness to skyrocketing home prices. Read the @HouseNewDems report by @RepDennyHeck for more: https://t.co/H9tfDMXKO8 https://t.co/RTodABETvRDo no harm. That's rule #1 for doctors, and that should be rule #1 for Congress too. This Congress's harmful health care choices have driven up WA premiums by 19%. For WA families that's the difference between affording health care or not. WA ought to be getting a #abetterdeal https://t.co/2qkGjucetoTalk is cheap. Congress should pass the Honest Ads Act and set Internet-wide laws that shine a light on the murky world of political advertising. #honestads https://t.co/aSboFm57DFThere’s too much money in politics. It’s creating gridlock and pushing out people who want to solve problems. Worst of all its causing people to lose faith in their government. I’m proud to co-chair the Reformers Caucus. Looking forward to meeting today https://t.co/qFsCKmTDcOI'm honored to receive @nature_org's Conservation Champion Award. The fight to protect our public lands and waters is a fight for jobs and our region's identity. Let's protect our economy by opposing offshore drilling and grow it by passing the National Park Service Legacy Act. https://t.co/5widwRVebtOffshore drilling risks everything. 

Today, I proposed a bipartisan amendment to block drilling off our coast. While the amendment failed, there are more chances down the road. I'll keep fighting for our coasts. #ProtectOurCoast https://t.co/ptB9HVRn49In the land of the free and the home of the brave, every brave veteran ought to have a home. It's unacceptable to me that there are 40,056 homeless veterans in the United States. Congress should pass the Homeless #Veteran Families Act. Here's more: https://t.co/snyOftckwSThe president's health care changes mean WA residents will see a 19% average increase in premiums this year, &amp; now his prescription drug plan means higher drug prices for Medicare's sickest patients. WA's middle class and seniors can't afford #Trumpcare https://t.co/IOkTIMwBF0Tribal communities deserve equal treatment under the law. When they don't get it, it hurts local jobs. For example, there's an 1834 law that bans distilleries on tribal lands. Rep. @HerreraBeutler &amp; I wrote a bill to fix that. @RSI explains why it matters https://t.co/PRy8eZtSbdToday’s #SCOTUS opinion underscores the importance of nationwide nondiscrimination protections.  When an American walks into a store, they shouldn’t have to wonder whether they’ll be denied service because of who they love or who they are.The #JobsReport growth is uneven. From 2011-16 rural areas added just 3% of new jobs. This AM at the State of Grays Harbor, I highlighted successes like Aberdeen's @HESCOGroup and called for Congress to invest in #infrastructure &amp; #broadband so rural job reports look like this 📈 https://t.co/KRNyAp7Hp2Over the last few days I had the chance to meet with young people from across our region who are seeking nomination to our military service academies. They always inspire me. Couldn't join us? Here's the link to more information: https://t.co/gnwoE45TsOAnytime I'm nearby, I try to sandwich time in between meetings for a stop at the @TacomasMarkets #nomnomnom https://t.co/WeS3UqFhJVEach May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. As the month winds down, I reflected on what that means for our region here: https://t.co/CQhA77Btsn  

#APAHMNothing beats our neck of the woods. https://t.co/9cB4QRS715Facebook's announcement today is a positive step. Voters deserve to know who's influencing our elections. Voluntary steps are a good start, but Congress should pass the #HonestAds Act to shine a light on the murky world of political advertising. https://t.co/VNclf2fiDKGreat to see the record-breaking turnout today for Puget Sound Day on the Hill. Together, we've been able to protect funding that keeps the Sound healthy &amp; we've won investments that will help slow stormwater runoff. Let's keep pushing to #SaveOurSound 🌅Want to attend a military service academy? The application for a nomination is online now! My team will be in Bremerton later this week and in Tacoma next week to answer questions. More on my Facebook page: https://t.co/gIZEMUBR3U https://t.co/8plmR8SOYaThere's too much 💰 in politics. Today, Dems in Congress rolled out a #ABetterDeal to give people back their voices. It includes ideas I've led on like online ad disclosures, campaign finance reforms, bans on foreign money and protecting the right to 🗳. https://t.co/FIYSTlEejjEvery time I fly to DC, I've started my commute with 2 things: 1-reading the @SI_PeterKing @themmqb column and 2-writing my daughters a letter about what Congress is (or more realistically isn't) doing in the week ahead. Bummed that 50% of my routine is changing. Good luck Peter.It is a privilege to represent you. Thank you for your service. #ArmedForcesDay2018 https://t.co/GYN1lCsmXzToday’s the anniversary of the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens. I still remember watching the news in first grade. Today, I'm fighting hard for early warning systems that could help save lives the next time there’s a major geologic event. #mtsthelens https://t.co/I6dpxXoHvbThe #FarmBill is supposed to be about people. What I'm voting on today isn't for us. I am voting no. Congress should work on a bipartisan Farm Bill that actually helps farmers and the families who use the Farm Bill's nutrition assistance to make ends meet https://t.co/aWH3BcxXcuThis week is National Police Week. Thank you to our neighbors who show up to work each day willing to put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe. Today I am holding Deputy Daniel McCartney, his wife and his three boys in my thoughts. #PoliceWeek2018 https://t.co/oBdWsKp11tI just signed a petition to force a vote on comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform because #Dreamers deserve a vote! They are our neighbors, serving in our military, starting businesses and paying taxes. As a nation of immigrants, we’re better than this. #queenofthehill 🗽“Lean forward. Take the challenging jobs. Try to improve the process. Look for a better way to do things...Look forward to being a part of something that’s greater than yourselves." – Rear Admiral Kristen Fabry. 

Congratulations on your promotion! 🇺🇸
https://t.co/Nnfcuim1tAThe Senate just passed #NetNeutrality legislation. I support a similar measure in the House. I think it is time to reform our aging telecom laws so they're up to speed with technology, and they protect consumers' rights.It is #timetobuild.  Here's where Congress should start: https://t.co/9SNaHphTSx #InfrastructureWeekThis week, I dropped in on the training center for @IronWorkers_PNW, Local 86. It is time to invest in our bridges and roads--these folks are up for the challenges &amp; rewarding work the skilled trades offer. Congress: time to get moving on infrastructure reform #infrastructureweek https://t.co/LNllUrWJO3Big thanks to @PattyMurray and @SenatorCantwell. All three of us have worked to support the FTA's Capital Investment Grant program, which made the grant possible. This expansion to Tacoma Link will improve access to the Stadium Business District, Medicle Mile and Hilltop.The FTA juts approved a $75m grant to double the size of Tacoma's lightrail and add 6 stations. That's great news for the City of Destiny--the light rail system will connect more workers to jobs, shoppers to businesses, and neighborhoods to each other. 🚈 #InfrastructureWeek20183,500 reasons for Congress to pass the #HonestAds Act. https://t.co/MKNFkvCLe8Looking forward to kicking off the @pgpfoundation #FiscalSummit in a few minutes. I’ll be speaking with @RepTomReed about how Congress can work together to tackle the nation’s fiscal challenges. Up early? Watch here: https://t.co/VPw5mOD5ccToday the Planetary Caucus officially launched. I met @RobertPicardo &amp; I wasn’t sure whether to call him Doctor or Coach! The Caucus's goal is to ensure America keeps investing in #space. Everything we use to @exploreplanets is built down here, which means #jobs in our region. https://t.co/pNfMsWbv5kAmerica's competitiveness in the global economy is directly tied to our fiscal health. Congress should invest in our kids' futures without saddling them with debt. Tomorrow @RepTomReed and I will discuss a way forward at the @pgpfoundation's #FiscalSummit  https://t.co/9smSHjjpDjGreat convo happening now on the #PellDivide w/@ThirdWayEDU.  Pell Grants are a great tool, but the tool is getting rusty. Congress should pass the Pathways to an Affordable Education Act which reforms Pell and helps more people get the skills to compete. https://t.co/RwX6zNpFXqCensus experts say the citizenship question could lead to millions of people - including legal residents - not participating in the #2020Census.

I'm looking forward to sharing ways Congress can more responsibly manage the nation's finances and offering some ideas to create more opportunities in our changing economy. More here: https://t.co/9smSHjjpDjMany #SmallBusinesses employ workers in the skilled trades. They're hiring. 70% of the nation's construction companies have unfilled jobs.

Yesterday, I reminded the EPA‘s Scott Pruitt of that. He spent millions this year on fancy travel and soundproofing his office but $0 for waterproofing our schools or protecting Puget Sound. https://t.co/mZLrQBCn4rPresident Trump promised he would staff his administration with the best people. But he picked a politician to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who openly admits that he only meets with lobbyists who gave to his campaigns. We deserve better. https://t.co/69cKGsuq2B.@EmmanuelMacron visited Congress today. His visit is a good reminder that America can create more opportunities for folks here at home when it plays an active role abroad. We should remain in the #ParisAccords and work more with our partners like #France 🇫🇷🇺🇸Few people captured what makes our region so special better than Ruth Kirk. She was literally a trail blazer.

Thanks Ruth: https://t.co/yZ2j5MUhOXPeople pay big money to visit the awesome place we call home. Tourists spend more than $21.4b annually in our state and that means jobs—177k of them.

For 40 yrs, the Boat School has equipped folks with the skills they need to compete in the changing economy.

To join email your name and number to kilmer.teletownhall@mail.house.gov.Last week’s Facebook hearings made for good TV, but Congress did nothing to address the problems in our elections. The #HonestAds Act is a no-brainer. Here are some other ways Congress could help folks take back our democracy from special interests. https://t.co/C0qUntzm91"The researchers couldn't find any trace, in federal records or online, of half of the 228 groups it tracked that purchased Facebook ads about controversial political issues in that six-week stretch.” Hey Congress, let’s pass the #HonestAds Act. https://t.co/KT5eEFsWNhRSVPs to kilmer.teletownhall@mail.house.gov should include your name and phone number and are due by midnight Pacific on Tuesday.There was a lot of talk last week about #Facebook, but no action on the #HonestAds Act. This Wed, @IssueOneReform’s CEO @Nick_Penniman will join my teletownhall at 6pm PST. We'll talk about how Congress can get gov working better for you. RSVP: Kilmer.teletownhall@mail.house.govYou spoke out against outrageous park fee hikes. It worked! The @NatlParkService will only raise entry fees by $5 rather than tripling them. Let's solve the park maintenance backlog. Congress should pass the National Parks Service Legacy Act. #parksforall https://t.co/4Y8a5mWgEMToday, on #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we pause to remember those lost.

There’s a better way to pay for park upgrades than raising visitor fees, which will hurt our economy. That’s why I wrote the National Parks Service Legacy Act. I asked Sec. Zinke for an update about this today: https://t.co/xIxyuATdRYDrilling off our coasts risks our economy and way of life.

Let’s go Tacoma! 🤞🏻https://t.co/p2q5dN1rbGImagine counting down the days until retirement and finding out you owe years longer than everyone else you work with, even though you worked the same amount of time. That’s happening to federal workers at places like the shipyard. I'm working to fix it: https://t.co/lqbeULFDatBusy day today but it was fueled by the #bestcornedbeefhashever. Thanks to Laura and the team at Hudson Point Cafe in Port Townsend for the great start! https://t.co/qzmh9jzfwKThis afternoon, I joined the Port Townsend Rotary to hear about what they’re doing in our communities to grow businesses and create great jobs. Count me as your partner. https://t.co/88mAA10WMYYoung people are leading the way in our changing economy and in changing our nation for the better.

Share this post with talented students in our region—just over three weeks left! More here: https://t.co/8cYdmdAwcGThis AM I talked w/ @nataliebrandk5 about how America can counter Russian aggression against our allies and online. The UK Caucus I co-chair recently sent @10DowningStreet a letter of support from the American people. Good to see decisive action today. https://t.co/G4x7O8JhSq https://t.co/BYowxJ1rJXOur region’s identity and economy are directly tied to Puget Sound's health. The president budgeted $0 for Puget Sound recovery funding. I pushed back from my seat on @AppropsDems. This week's budget included $28 million to keep the Sound healthy https://t.co/vNkDBGzE5sI’m lucky to work with so many folks committed to service, like our region’s mayors &amp; city councils, county executives and commissioners, &amp; folks in Olympia all working to grow opportunities. Good things happen when everyone’s rowing in the same direction https://t.co/LmqN23AAYG@MDeWitt760 @MateoAlto You guys are touching on a big problem. I agree-the process is messed up.  I wrote about this recently here https://t.co/0LTmP6Z4ZS@AnnMRavel It is vital we find out what the @FEC needs to do its job. It is also important to pass the #HonestAds Act, to show who is buying the political ads we see online.In the Pacific Northwest we know the next big earthquake or tsunami is not a matter of if, but when. Today’s funding bill increased funds for vital earthquake early warning systems that will buy folks on our coasts lifesaving time in an emergency. 

https://t.co/I6dpxXoHvbThe spending bill that passed the House today included a provision I authored telling the FEC to get to work fighting foreign influence in America’s elections. Earlier today, I talked about why that matters with @thehill. Check it out here.: https://t.co/vApPs1ivS0While no deal's perfect, there's a lot in the funding bill Congress passed today that will help Washington state. Here's more: https://t.co/f5n42Rn9E0For generations, keeping the Navy at sea has been what we do. Today I spoke with the Puget Sound Ship Repair Association about ways we can create opportunities to help the industry and create more skilled workers. https://t.co/5hu6kvj77QAmerica’s National Parks are overdue for repairs. Fixing them up means jobs for our region. Today, the bill I wrote w/@HurdOnTheHill to get the job done (and the jobs growing) cleared an important step in the process to getting a vote. Check it out: https://t.co/lCB0cskJM3The @EximBankUS helps businesses small and large get the loans they need to sell products made in our state to customers abroad. That means jobs for folks in our region. Our leaders ought to have a plan to get this agency fully running. It matters: https://t.co/yRC8YnSQsICheck out the latest way the Composite Recycling Technology Center in Port Angeles have created jobs using new technologies. Through a local partnership program, more than 150 new carbon fiber benches will be installed in PA this year. https://t.co/GnLxPmVjiFLooking for the latest local distillery? You probably won’t find it in Indian Country thanks to a 184-year old law. @HerreraBeutler &amp; I want to change that. Congress should let tribal communities get in on the jobs this booming sector creates. https://t.co/MRHFmZXBsnIn the Northwest, we know the next big earthquake is a question of when, not if. That’s why I’ll keep pushing the government to fund early earthquake warning systems, and support smart infrastructure investment. https://t.co/SkBiglSCH3Happy #StPatricksDay Looking for some music to celebrate?

Enter the Congressional Art Competition. One artist from our region will have their artwork installed in the Capitol, and the winning artist will win a trip for two to see it!

Can you name all of them? Tweet me with your guessesFederal #workstudy opens doors to great opportunities. Congress should modernize it so students get skills they can add to their resume when they graduate. That’s why @RepBonamici and I introduced the Opportunities for Success Act this week.This week is #sunshineweek. From campaign finance reform to open data policies, here’s more on what I’m doing to make sure government is accessible and accountable to you. https://t.co/dkcBM8bBIUThe economy may be changing, but Americans still want the #OpportunitytoEarn a great living and a great job...Congress needs to get to work on an agenda to help them do it.Washington state exports nearly $80 billion in goods annually and a lot of those goods move through our waterways. I joined folks from the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association yesterday to discuss how Congress can be a better partner. https://t.co/P00mFIqKrGDarn right we are.

One big way: fund the Secure Rural Schools and Payment in Lieu of Taxes programs. I’m speaking more about this later today. Here's some background on why this matters: https://t.co/Y2GwqoQOwGRight now, WA leaders are meeting in Olympia to discuss the president’s plan to drill off our coast. Drilling jeopardizes our fishing and tourism economy. A spill could affect every coastal town I represent.

And thanks also to your students for their thoughtful comments and opinions. It is a privilege to represent you. https://t.co/3zrml7FnheLast week students at Central Kitsap High School walked out of school calling for Congress to do something to make schools safer. They also wrote this  op-ed in the Kitsap Sun. Today I met with them and asked them to help me send a message back to Congress https://t.co/U5NisOB49y https://t.co/b9d0TI8BvaToday I joined @exploreplanets and scientists working to return rock samples from Mars by 2020 so scientists on Earth can study them. Projects like these inspire kids to study STEM and create jobs on Earth in WA. #Mars2020 literally rocks. https://t.co/mKOVQYseUQToday I stood w/ @RepTedDeutch who represents Parkland, FL, and Republicans @RepDonBacon @RepHalRogers and @RepRutherfordFL and @sandyhook to call for Congress to protect our kids. Congress should show some courage and act now. The #STOPSchoolViolenceAct is a good start. https://t.co/Q1mUyTx7D3Jobs in our region from our oceans, to our forests to our national parks depend on a clean environment. That’s why I fight so hard for policies that protect the #environment. Today @LCVoters gave me a 💯on their #LCscoredcard for my record on the environment. Thanks!It’s a bird, it’s a crane!

Today I was named to the bipartisan committee of Senators and Representatives tasked with fixing the problem. I'm excited for the chance to end the uncertainty and bring your voice back to DC.I work for you and one of my most important roles is bridging the gap between folks from our region and your government. You asked for an extension of the public comment period on the Navy’s training plans, and the Navy listened. https://t.co/22ZMJFAedaAn economy that works for everyone has opportunities for workers to learn the skills they need to compete. This article shows how important this is: with the right skills, folks in our region will out-compete everybody, everywhere, every day, forever. https://t.co/mmKGWpstu0A lot has happened over the last two weeks. Catch up on the latest news from both Washingtons here: https://t.co/e77OMwSOm8In addition to the need for the #HonestAds Act, today’s #Russia indictments show Congress needs to get serious about #cybersecurity, and the president needs to appoint commissioners to the #FEC. I wrote him this week on that, &amp; I have legislation to help states secure cyberspace.More here on #HonestAds, a bill I introduced in the House: https://t.co/mDoXzwih9lToday 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities were indicted for buying online political ads in an attempt to influence how you vote.

This needs to get done. https://t.co/BQBiIEjoaShttps://t.co/SC99VCDd6JThe federal government’s commitment to tribal communities isn’t discretionary. I joined the @NCAI1944 to talk about how Congress can do a better job living up to its end of the deal. https://t.co/Q2PDeBFiGxOne of the challenges facing Congress is that people in both parties struggle to find common ground. @RepJimRenacci &amp; I co-chair the Bipartisan Working Group. We've worked on 57 pieces of legislation together. I guess you could say he’s my #CongressionalValentine #cupidonthehill https://t.co/mPVYXk8zEVThe President’s budget reads like a copy of the #HungerGames. His infrastructure plan sticks states and local govs with the bill, and lets his buddies on Wall Street pick which projects get funded. There's a better way: check out the @HouseNewDems plan https://t.co/3pqQm97G81Tribes from across the US are converging in DC this week to tell their stories through the @NCAI1944.

Another reason why the @statedep is so important and deserves Congress’s and the President’s support. https://t.co/3GPIsr0ygmThe #SOTU included moving stories about communities facing the #opioid crisis. Our community knows this fight. Congress should pass the Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse Treatment &amp; Accessibility Act because there are hundreds of stories like Noah's https://t.co/g74pVWgjR7Proud of my friend @RepJoeKennedy who reminds us that the values that unite us as Americans are far more powerful than the politics that divide us.https://t.co/cddnfnjh1EI’m getting ready to attend the #StateoftheUnion with Mark Martinez, President of Washington’s Building and Construction Trades Council because I want to highlight the importance of investing in #infrastructure so that we can build an economy that works for everyone. https://t.co/F8y4Bj93vDIt’s no secret foreign actors want to influence American voters. In the 2016 elections Washington was one of 21 states Russian hackers targeted. @oversightdems are trying to learn more. This is why the #HonestActsAct and electoral reform is so important. https://t.co/oiIBxdlcReI’m hopeful President Trump will talk about rural broadband in tomorrow’s #stateoftheunion.

That’s because @NOAA’s early warning buoys can detect potential tsunamis long before expected landfall. That’s a lifesaver. Let’s keep pushing for investments in this critical tool. https://t.co/VsAuQIFPFeThis week, America dropped out of the top 10 in @business’s annual innovation rating. Congress needs to invest in #STEM education and value-added manufacturing. Until that happens, other countries will out-compete us and eat our lunch: https://t.co/udDr1Dg75VI'm glad that the shutdown is over and federal workers from our region can go to work. Congress should stop the partisan bickering and the blame games. Let's focus on a bipartisan, long-term budget and other important priorities.

Time for a bipartisan, long-term solution.House leadership wants to send Members home today despite the threat of a shutdown. I just voted no on a Motion to Adjourn because Congress should stay and do its job by passing a bipartisan, long-term spending deal.Apprenticeship programs are a powerful training tool for employers, and a path to the middle class for workers.

Here’s why: https://t.co/4UOV63cRMHI’ll be following this closely as the NTSB does their work, and will use the full power of this office to help the people who are affected by this tragedy and to try to prevent future tragedies like this.Thanks to the passengers who got out of their cars immediately after the incident and bravely pitched in to help people—that tells you all you need to know about how strong our region is. We have each other’s backs.Thanks to the federal, state, and local officials who are working to respond to this as well as to the news organizations who have been working to keep everyone informed with the facts.Thanks to all of our amazing first responders and medical teams around the region who responded so well and so quickly, to the teams at Joint Base Lewis-McChord who helped out today, the Washington State Patrol, the Red Cross and our community blood centersOn behalf of our community, I took to the House floor to express our condolences to everyone affected by the #AmtrakDerailment today. I am thinking about everyone back home tonight. https://t.co/oCTgLySI6EIf you want to see a tax plan that gives most of the benefits to corporations and the wealthy &amp; adds $1 trillion to our debt, check out Congress's. Want a tax plan that actually helps the middle class and grows our economy responsibly? Check out this: https://t.co/avbGDqHgMrI pray for the safety of those affected by the derailment of Amtrak 501 near Dupont including passengers, commuters &amp; first responders. I stand ready to work with Amtrak, state &amp; federal officials as they manage the response to this incident.Today I joined a ribbon-cutting for the new @Amtrak Cascades Tacoma Dome Station &amp; the Tacoma Trestle replacement. The project means more options for commuters &amp; better service which will keep commuters and our economy moving.

https://t.co/WEsXD7u4I7Today, we remember the terrible tragedy at #SandyHook. Congress shouldn’t have more moments of silence for those who were lost that day. It’s time for action for them: https://t.co/AL8ULKanTDIn the latest installment of my podcast, I speak with @RepRoKhanna of California about #netneutrality, public service, and the travesty that is the refereeing of the fight in Rocky IV.

RT to tell your friends: https://t.co/GOu9uZ26OY)) https://t.co/aoQK2ndFCsDon’t fall for the #taxbill. https://t.co/dUo8o57Q65Message to the #taxreform Conference Committee: These aren’t the tax cuts we’re looking for https://t.co/VACbwPMhWYThe Treasury analysis of the #taxbill suggests that tax cuts alone won’t pay for the bill. That means cuts to things that help build the middle class. Here’s a good breakdown of what’s at stake: https://t.co/954ZWptPsXWe are #stillin the #ParisAgreement so coastal tribal communities like the Quinault Nation don’t have to be relocated because of sea-level rise. https://t.co/vt6JlWXJWgPleased to see that after 325 days, we finally have a nominee for ambassador to South Korea. #Diplomacy https://t.co/EverzmFDd1After a bomb threat was called in to the Stroum Jewish Community Center in February, folks from our region told me the law didn't classify the threat as a hate crime. Today we said “enough is enough” and passed a bill I co-wrote that fixes that problem.

https://t.co/FVlIlr2UoKThe #budget passes by going from the House to the Senate to the @WhiteHouse. Last I checked R's ran all 3.  I’m missing time w/ my constituents because going it alone isn’t working. They’re asking Dems to save the day. We've asked to compromise for months https://t.co/O84usxuBEWI had to skip an export workshop with small businesses in my district today because Republicans aren’t willing to compromise on a bipartisan budget. They spent eight months passing partisan spending bills, and now want Dems to vote for them? https://t.co/5f110HvU7CThis week the House quietly passed a measure that would strip federal workers of workplace protections designed to insulate the civil service from political influence. I opposed it. https://t.co/OpWDiFlGPOThe more we learn about the #tax bill, the worse it gets. I support meaningful reform, but oppose the current “plan.” It adds a lot of #debt which is bad for the economy and jobs. Looks like the Senate is realizing it too https://t.co/RZElMUplUcThanks for following along this week w/ what is important to me during these #budget conversations. These priorities impact our local economy &amp; jobs, keep folks healthy, &amp; protect our environment. I want to hear what's important to you. Reach out to me: https://t.co/vWDRdXFjgoGood morning, it was great talking with everyone last night. I hope if you participated you found the conversation as helpful as I did. Thanks for your time and thoughtful questions. https://t.co/zgho8YuUCtBusy #budget meetings with the Appropriations committee today. We heard from the Dep. Sec. of @Interior about relief efforts for #USVI and #PuertoRico and from @DEAHQ Acting Admin Robert Patterson about the #opioidcrisis. https://t.co/CwGjKiTT2FThis month was #NativeAmericanHeritageMonth. I’ve visited w/each of the 11 tribal communities whose homes are situated in the district I represent. It is a privilege to advocate for them in Congress: https://t.co/pXDrJIBOFYTonight’s the night! Join me at 6:15pm PT for another telephone town hall. If you forgot to sign up, email kilmer.teletownhall@mail.house.gov for more information.Today I spoke w/ @KOMOnews from deep in the basement of the Capitol about the  #budget, fisheries disaster relief &amp; meaningful #taxreform that actually helps the middle class. Keep an eye out for the Connect to Congress segment soon. Here's a quick preview https://t.co/iEtEIdtipZ https://t.co/jIBhbDncvIFolks are counting on Congress to make health care more affordable for more people. That’s why I’m working to protect children’s health care through #CHIP, and supporting measures that would stop rising premiums for folks shopping on @WAplanfinder: https://t.co/8tDdUM3BEmOver the last yr &amp; a half, natural disasters have wreaked havoc on our fisheries &amp; forests. I’ve fought for fisheries recovery funding &amp; a long-term wildfire borrowing fix. Congress &amp; the President need to step up &amp; fully fund relief https://t.co/BpLdV8onm0It’s time for another telephone #townhall. Join me this Thursday at 6:15pm Pacific this Thursday, November 30. Let me know what is important to you! https://t.co/VFiogDXkATHappy Thanksgiving to you and yours! https://t.co/LxKYmWhdwvThanks to @OlympicOutdoor in Kitsap County for hosting me today! We talked small biz jobs and the importance of stopping the proposed National Park admission fee increase and my plan to fund park maintenance, the National Parks Legacy Act. https://t.co/8uliE7k8IuThanks to everyone who has reached out to my office. I oppose the Trump Admin’s proposal to end #NetNeutrality rules. I support a free and open internet. Keep speaking up on this. Click here to make your voice heard https://t.co/tvoIB5KUf8We spoke up, and the pressure is on. @Interior extended the period for people to weigh in on the proposed National Parks fee hike to December 22. Speak up! There are better ways to fund maintenance like the National Park Legacy Act. #hiketrailsnotfees https://t.co/GtHFa56WRKTimber 2.0 is the next great Washington story and it is happening right here in our backyard—cross-laminated timber provides economic opportunity in our neck of the woods.

Your money should never be used to cover up wrongdoing. I support @SenGillibrand &amp; @RepSpeier’s plan to clean up this place https://t.co/76Pg4Zpez6Billy Frank Jr. told people seeking justice to “tell your story.” For 60 years, @USCCRgov has listened and amplified the voices across our community through the Quiet Crisis report. I am glad we can partner in the pursuit of justice. https://t.co/mXFouc07vXMore than 3 million people visit Olympic National Park each year. That means jobs—3,800 of them for folks in my area. If less people visit because they can’t afford the entry fee, that’s bad news for us. Keep parks open for everyone. Speak up here: https://t.co/GtHFa4Pm0cThere is better idea for fixing “America’s Best Idea” than sticking visitors with the bill. I have a bipartisan plan to reduce the maintenance backlog.  Read more about the National Park Legacy Act here: https://t.co/U1ZCyNCApn #ParksforAllI support nature hikes, not entry fee hikes. Speak up against the fee hike before Thanksgiving here: https://t.co/GtHFa4Pm0c #ParksforAllA fitting tribute to Richard F. Gordon Jr. His inspiring life of exploration with @nasa and service with the @USNavy helped America plant a flag on the moon. Thanks to him we understand our world and the universe beyond it a little better. 
https://t.co/lVBqOFeySRQuick summary of how the #taxbill treats the middle class. https://t.co/NbdOaWrSxzI offered to work with Republicans on #taxreform because I believe we need good tax reform. Instead #specialinterests wrote it behind closed doors.The #TaxBill adds trillions to the debt, it will lead to slower economic growth than paid-for tax reform. As a result of the growing debt, Americans will see slower wage growth, higher interest payments, and fewer jobs.I voted against the #tax bill today. It caters to the wealthy, raises #middleclass taxes &amp; adds to the debt which slows growth. https://t.co/iwjszRCZTB #derekvotes https://t.co/YcJwo4xIikThe House just passed a bill I wrote that makes government more transparent and gives the public more access to government data so Americans can invent new technology, start businesses and create jobs.
