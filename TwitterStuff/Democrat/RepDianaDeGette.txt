In @denverpost I’m sharing what I saw during my trip last weekend to the U.S. border and an @ICEgov detention facility in Aurora. It’s clear from what I witnessed that we must do better as a nation to reunite families and treat all migrants with dignity. https://t.co/P5QdtXGSzwToday, principled individuals in our community and many others across America are taking to the streets and uniting to declare: #FamiliesBelongTogether. Victims of #FamilySeparation are counting on us to keep up this vital activism until all are reunited. We won't let them down. https://t.co/CYxlrzljHmIn this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including sharing details from my recent trip to the U.S. border, laying out my plan to reunite families and achieve immigration reform, responding to #SCOTUS rulings and wishing you a happy #FourthofJuly. https://t.co/6blRpLVdo3#AnthonyKennedy's retirement from #SCOTUS puts our precarious #reprorights in grave danger. One more anti-choice justice could tip this already-divided court, hampering women's health for generations. We can't let Trump and his GOP allies get their way. https://t.co/5CViU4rq9A https://t.co/gaWPWES16VThe #Janus decision strikes a major blow to public sector employees and will undermine teachers, police officers, firefighters and countless others who serve our community. We must continue to fight for strong workplace rights and fair working conditions for all Americans. https://t.co/12E8B81VN5#NetNeutrality protects small businesses and innovators in our community by ensuring they have a level playing field online. The Trump @FCC’s repeal has gut those protections. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/JtzmH5Hnq0Because of #NIFLAvBecerra, crisis pregnancy centers will be able to intentionally mislead, confuse, and misinform women about their health care options. What a disgrace. #EndTheLies https://t.co/OkDH4nD2GbIt's a dark and shameful day in this country when the highest court in the land refuses to condemn the bigotry on display in Trump's #MuslimBan. While I respect #SCOTUS' authority, I am horrified by its decision and will continue working to end this terrible policy. https://t.co/eXEAPMQ9zeMore details from my visit to the U.S. border and Aurora's @ICEgov detention facility this weekend. The parents and children I met, caught in the ongoing #FamilySeparation crisis, are people, not pawns – and our president needs to understand that. https://t.co/0jB7sOcyIMThis weekend, I heard heartbreaking stories directly from mothers and fathers whose children were ripped away as they sought refuge in this country. We must ensure the injustices they’ve faced are not in vain. We must reunite families and change our laws. https://t.co/0ABUsOu59DThat "long and complicated legal process" is called #DueProcess, and it's a cornerstone of our #democracy – the very reason people have long sought refuge here. President Trump’s startling lack of basic constitutional knowledge, as well as empathy, is extremely concerning. https://t.co/7sKyXn888sFive years ago, #SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, and since then, more than two dozen states have enacted laws making it harder to register and cast a ballot. Congress must pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act to stop this trend. https://t.co/DY8BDoKQjmOn @KOANewsRadio, I spoke to @AprilZesbaugh and @ContactLenz_KOA about what I gleaned from my fact finding trips this weekend to the U.S. border in Texas and the @ICEgov detention facility in Aurora as part of my ongoing efforts to end #FamilySeparation. Take a listen: https://t.co/Olk9yWhXn8At today’s #SaveTheChildren rally at the CO. State Capitol, I encouraged my fellow Coloradans to keep up the fight to end #FamilySeparation. My trip to the border this weekend and the passion for justice exhibited by my constituents have strengthened my resolve to achieve this. https://t.co/FxLpZBDc0YMore of my proposals to address the current immigration crisis. https://t.co/A1XMga8n0fI met with several bereft refugees at the Aurora detention center. They deserve far better than to be treated this way for seeking asylum in the USA - shattered families, unacceptably long waits under lock and key. Here are some of my proposals to address these issues and more. https://t.co/cCTB4l7677Parents w/ kids ripped away under the Trump #FamilySeparation campaign are at the ICE detention center here. The trauma continues as they await reunion; even then they’ll remain confined while their asylum cases are considered. I’m going to hear and help them tell their stories. https://t.co/b40FvBvzeRToday at the U.S.-Mexico border, I saw 45 refugee women who had been separated from their children, people waiting desperately to enter our country to seek refuge, and children as young as nine months in detention. Here’s what I plan to do about it: https://t.co/7zTfSFrVlSAt the Gateway International Bridge in Brownsville, Texas, speaking with people waiting to cross the border. Many have been waiting hours and even days make this short journey to seek asylum. We can protect our borders while also allowing refugees — a basic human right. https://t.co/Um48hkM1yFHeaded to Brownsville, the next stop on our visit to the border, where we’re witnessing  effects of Trump’s #FamilySeparation policy. His vague order this week has no provisions for reuniting shattered #refugee families and will still keep them locked up illegally. Disgraceful. https://t.co/SFg1XAb8c5The Trump admin. is failing so far to reunite families ripped apart through its “zero-tolerance” policy. Here on my trip to the U.S. border in McAllen, Texas, I’m calling for the creation of a special Czar to oversee reunification efforts and bring families together faster. https://t.co/vuKZk4jg5xOur delegation to the US. border is gathering to traverse the path of refugees, including those traumatized by #FamilySeparation. We’ll shine a spotlight, bear witness and keep pressure on @POTUS to work on a quick, comprehensive solution to the crisis he caused. More tomorrow. https://t.co/q6ImztCFaDAs I head to the U.S. border, here’s an update on my work to end refugee #FamilySeparation &amp; ensure family reunification, including sponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, demanding @SecNielsen's resignation, calling for hearings on the crisis and more. https://t.co/wyClsbBBCmThe Trump Administration has been disturbingly silent on the whereabouts and treatment of migrant girls separated from their families. What are they hiding? #WhereAreTheGirls? https://t.co/HZxlwWpKpkWe're using every available means to ensure that refugees traumatized by Trump’s cruel #FamilySeparation policy are reunited and that there is clarity about the condition and whereabouts of the more than 2,000 children victimized by this national disgrace. https://t.co/48YGG3fSVvThis crisis is far from over. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, then return to working on a comprehensive solution to our country’s broken immigration system. My full statement: https://t.co/YPJ5wsG4BsThis weekend, I will travel with congressional colleagues to the Southwest U.S. border to observe detention centers there and to meet with detainees. This Executive Order has changed nothing for them, and it won't erase their pain.2,300 children - from toddlers to teens - have been separated from their parents. Did the administration ever have any concrete plans to eventually reunite them? This Executive Order doesn’t even lay out a framework, which makes this situation even more tragic.Keeping asylee families in cages on charges that might not even apply to them is evil. We are a nation of laws, not some arbitrarily cruel authoritarian regime. Coming into this country without documentation is at worst a misdemeanor that does not call for ripping families apart.I call on all people of conscience across America to continue pushing Trump toward a more just and complete solution to the refugee crisis he created that hasn't been solved through his order - which was too little, too late.Trump’s belated Executive Order ending #FamilySeparation doesn't truly end it, since this vague order does nothing to reverse the damage his cruel campaign has inflicted. Children and their parents remain behind fences, locked doors and even the gates of military bases.I joined nearly 60 House Dem. women in sending a letter to @SecAzar and @SecNielsen asking: #WhereAreTheGirls &amp; very young children who have been separated at the border? The admin. has provided disturbingly little info on their whereabouts &amp; well-being. https://t.co/UWqxPagGND https://t.co/eyxWhHoa7mThis had to be deliberate. https://t.co/QgBQyJ92UpAmericans have placed tremendous pressure on @POTUS to end #FamilySeparation; our advocacy is working. We must keep it up to ensure follow-through and reunite these families, and move on to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/YLnVjqcZCCWe've raised the alarm about #FamilySeparation many times w/high Trump officials. On Friday, noting @EnergyCommerce colleagues share these concerns, I called for hearings. Today we made that official. More: https://t.co/R6dpA7m8qi https://t.co/UH2oPk36JDToday we recognize people fleeing persecution and war. In previous years, I've reflected on America's role in helping them, but now our country is creating a refugee crisis of our own. We must #KeepFamiliesTogether at our border, especially those seeking asylum. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/wQlPX936dKJoined fellow @HouseDemocrats, leading immigration advocates and a group of children, symbolic of those being ripped from their parents, to demand an end to #FamilySeparation at the U.S. border. @POTUS can stop this cruelty at any time. Why won't he? #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pTBPR4yjwg.@SecNielsen must resign or be fired from her position at @DHSgov over #FamilySeparation and her repeated lies and misrepresentations about the policy. Her lack of understanding of the law and total insensitivity to these families make her unfit to serve. https://t.co/5mrOh65vtA https://t.co/jf0DtGWiU1Today we introduced the Keep Families Together Act, HR 6135. It will stop @DHSgov from continuing the inhumane new #FamilySeparation campaign, which further traumatizes vulnerable children and their parents and is rightly being met with outrage worldwide. https://t.co/wYsPP3BekJ https://t.co/f0pzLnUqaYMore from @KOANewsRadio: The #FamilySeparation crisis and the fight to #ProtectDreamers are both symptoms of our broken immigration system. There is widespread support for bipartisan reform, but we must first unite to overcome a president and his dangerous immigration agenda. https://t.co/fHSrBCI1j9The Trump admin. is using vulnerable children as pawns in its fear campaign against immigrants and efforts to secure funding for a wasteful border wall. Meanwhile, families are being ripped apart by this startling lack of empathy. Hear more from my interview with @KOANewsRadio: https://t.co/8PXEE9PPQwOn @KOANewsRadio, I laid out why I oppose the cruel Trump #FamilySeparation campaign and spoke about my upcoming trip to the border to witness it first-hand. This is another result of the #GOP's refusal to pass immigration reform, and it can't continue. https://t.co/1a0K5HFJoU.@POTUS new #familyseparation campaign is inhumane. I’ll travel w/ 20+ other leaders to see the scene of this crime against humanity, how it harms vulnerable people and damages our nation’s stature. Must keep the pressure on to end this shameful chapter. https://t.co/2yNpoxtfm6I've long worked to end @POTUS' heinous "zero-tolerance" policy that is causing #FamilySeparation. This weekend, I will travel to the U.S - Mexico border in McAllen, TX to meet with those affected and further highlight why this cruelty must end. https://t.co/IaaiY1SvLn https://t.co/rvQqRmsq7nA shout-out to pioneering engineer, physicist &amp; astronaut Sally Ride. On this day 35 years ago, she became the 1st American woman in space. She went on to forge #STEM paths for other women, encouraging a new generation of girls to aim for the stars. #LGBTPrideMonth @SallyRideSci https://t.co/64o36eoyEYI've taken @Facebook to task over #privacy concerns, but it remains a key way to connect people. Today the company is teaching local #SMBs how to expand their digital platform at its Community Boost event, where I spoke to attendees about my efforts to restore #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/R270Yq4dwfHappy #FathersDay! Today I’m honoring my late father and my husband, Lino, who has been a devoted dad to our two daughters. To all men who have taken on the responsibility of loving, nurturing and teaching the kids in your lives: Today is your day. https://t.co/w3zYwadfARIn this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including working toward comprehensive immigration reform, restoring #NetNeutrality, celebrating a win for the #diabetes community, promoting environmental justice, encouraging bipartisanship and more.  https://t.co/2fvbkXqrhcBig development in the effort to #BootPruitt: Government’s top ethics official tells @EPAgov Inspector General to expand current inquiries &amp; get to the bottom of @EPAScottPruitt’s ethics messes so he can consider recommending disciplinary steps to @POTUS. https://t.co/s56BM80azS#FamilySeparation at the border is inhumane. I support the Keep Families Together Act, to be introduced next week. It will bar @DHSgov from separating kids from their parents except in very narrow, extraordinary circumstances - with independent oversight. The cruelty must end. https://t.co/dWJ2zboL6YAt a @HouseCommerce hearing with senior Trump administration appointees today, I highlighted the heinous practice of #FamilySeparation at the border. Committee Dems will soon send a letter to the chairman to call for a hearing on the topic, which is simply too inhumane to ignore. https://t.co/FdSmrpZLYBOne more day in DC, including a key hearing on public health – stay tuned for more on that – and House votes on the hazard of imported synthetic drugs. Then it’s back home to Colorado after a busy week here. Sign up for my newsletter to read all about it! https://t.co/q4toLUqO62It’s not the @Rockies, but it’s great once again to be at the #CongressionalBaseballGame with members of Team DeGette cheering on my fellow Democrats. Win or lose, this beloved, bipartisan event is always victorious in uniting Congress through America’s pastime. Let’s play ball! https://t.co/iyhMiRn6qdThe findings in the #IGreport are troubling, but it’s important to know that they have nothing to do with the #RussiaInvestigation. The report also doesn’t show any bias within the @FBI or any “deep state” in favor of Hillary Clinton. #WeDemandTheTruth https://t.co/C5zJz6kPBoAt a @HouseCommerce hearing on protecting chemical facilities from terrorism, I questioned experts about measures to safeguard nearby residents against toxic emissions from these facilities, including @Suncor's refinery near Elyria-Swansea, a potential hazard for thousands. https://t.co/Iaa6s9QAHAI support @RepBarbaraLee’s RESPECT resolution because it will help right a long-standing wrong. The war on drugs has devastated communities of color; we must ensure training and job opportunities in the legal #marijuana industry are open for all Americans. https://t.co/dnC2ZIRPDQWonderful seeing @believeEan of @COLatinoForum while he's here in DC. We discussed the importance of risk management plans for industrial facilities such as @Suncor's facility in Elyria-Swansea, along with other environmental justice issues that are important to our region. https://t.co/sJykQW2KyEHappy to meet with Tara Prendergast and Lydia Waligorski, who are both helping to aid @CCADV1's mission of ending domestic violence in Colorado. Strengthening lifelines such as #VOCA and #VAWA will also help put a stop to this horrific abuse in our state and across America. https://t.co/8kLuQXZQLZDenying asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence is just plain wrong. I'm wearing a #PurpleRibbon today to express my opposition to this new policy by @POTUS and AG Sessions This country must remain a haven to those in desperate need of safety and security. https://t.co/MhDLVOJF3fColorado members of @CWAUnion are visiting Washington. They're rightly concerned about the #GOPTaxScam's harmful effects on working families who are struggling to get by. My fellow Democrats and I are pushing back, offering #ABetterDeal for all Americans. https://t.co/80lNyMObTLThough @HouseGOP leaders have ensured the failure of our discharge petition to bring immigration bills such as the #DreamAct up for a vote, it's not the end of our fight. I'll continue working to pass smart policies that #ProtectDreamers and safeguard families. https://t.co/iDvfFlneCeGood news for those w/diabetes who are on #Medicare: You can now link continuous glucose monitors to cell phones/tablets without concern about losing federal benefits. @RepTomReed &amp; I teamed up to get this change made. It will help 300K people nationwide. https://t.co/rzr08INzWYChick-fil-A staff don’t work on Sundays, but it seems @EPAScottPruitt and his staff were working overtime on the taxpayer dime to get his wife a job there or, as we’re now learning, with high-dollar donors or at a conservative dark money group. Yet another reason to #BootPruitt. https://t.co/Y4hTIeFc6GTalking #bipartisanship in Congress on topics ranging from #marijuana to the spaceport application with colleagues from the Centennial State and members of @ColoradoBRT who came to town for their annual Colorado Capital Conference. ⁦@jaredpolis⁩ ⁦⁦@RepTipton⁩ https://t.co/hNIzI5LWVNIn the two years since the horrific shooting at #Pulse nightclub, our country has lost even more parents, siblings, and friends to gun violence.

Population growth and #climatechange pose challenges, but sustainability efforts can help ensure clean water - and beer - remain on tap. https://t.co/4gQfbJlDXFBefore the Affordable Care Act, insurers denied coverage for many people with these #PreExistingConditions. That changed with the #ACA, but @POTUS' choice not to defend this protection in court could take us back to those dark days. We can’t let it happen. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/Yk089fCZ3eAn important reminder: You can apply for a #DACA renewal even if your last application was rejected specifically due to not meeting the October 5, 2017 deadline.

Millions rely on this life-saving coverage. We must continue fighting to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/qCTqMmnigDOur next community forum is happening tomorrow at @BRGrizzlies. From immigration to @EPAScottPruitt to #gunsafety and more, we have a lot to cover, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts, which have always guided my decision-making. RSVP here: https://t.co/h0qZpb68Kh https://t.co/GPhBnU5eEIThis is 3.6 million kids too many. More troubling is that e-cigarettes and cigars were some of the most commonly used tobacco products among adolescents. Another good reason to ban flavors in these products, which I urged in a letter I led to @US_FDA. https://t.co/C5AGQeXPPl https://t.co/cQIbKYj0loThe poster boys for western conservatism? Sessions &amp; @EPAScottPruitt, with their many attacks on our values and environment - on top of a bevy of scandals that have raised the bipartisan call to #BootPruitt. Today especially, I’m proud always to have been a Colorado progressive. https://t.co/ssdn2aMtF4Gut-wrenching: “Since his arrival in Michigan, family members said, a day has not gone by when the boy has failed to ask in Spanish, ‘When will I see my papa?’ They tell him the truth. They do not know. No one knows.”

This is simply inhumane.

https://t.co/pTPoj0rQWOI've sponsored a resolution condemning @POTUS' "zero-tolerance" policy letting federal authorities separate parents and children at the border. This startling lack of humanity goes against our country's core values. We must work to protect these families. https://t.co/lJPNdBcE3j https://t.co/5FsDXh9gB7Ritz Carlton lotion: Just the right remedy for dry skin after a long flight in First Class.

Protecting and advancing equality, equity and freedoms for all has long been a top priority, particularly now when so many rights are threatened as never before. https://t.co/vgmWE5WaOZIt’s been 55 years since the passage of the #EqualPayAct, and we've made progress in that time, but the #paygap remains. That’s why I urge my colleagues to stand up for families and our economy by passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct. https://t.co/gqA3uSbRBc53 years ago, #GriswoldvCT established our right to #birthcontrol access, helping to guaranteed women the freedom to make their own choices about their career, their family, and their health. We won’t let @POTUS or anyone else take us backward. #ThanksGriswoldColoradans voted for responsible marijuana legalization, and our state is better off because of it. That's why I'm supporting the #STATESAct, to ensure residents are protected from the federal government's meddling into these freedoms within our borders. https://t.co/VtBclymSOS https://t.co/M3VCh51UBKI led more than 100 of my colleagues in sending @EPAScottPruitt a letter demanding he withdraw the recently-proposed "transparency rule" that would let @EPA selectively suppress scientific evidence.

Since #CitizensUnited, the cost of our elections and the amount of misinformation continues to skyrocket, and we must work to give power back to the people. https://t.co/vClABgBcZyThese two heartbreaking articles further highlight the startling lack of humanity in our broken immigration system, exacerbated by the Trump administration's total lack of respect &amp; empathy given to the families caught in its grip. https://t.co/EHoV3f9QbZ  https://t.co/W50SuyOVbW#DoddFrank helped stabilize lower-income communities hard-hit by the Great Recession. @POTUS' action takes away these protections from discriminatory and predatory lending and empowers bad actors once more, setting the stage for another collapse. https://t.co/SfdYPLvVXAOur fourth annual Resource Fair for Seniors and Caregivers is happening on Monday, June 4.

RSVP here: https://t.co/Z5sJDZn5F9 https://t.co/xzR1mev9V0I joined @PPFA today in pushing back on @POTUS' new #TitleX domestic gag rule. Women deserve access to – as well as knowledge of – the full range of #reprorights available to them. Forcing health care providers to censor this information is not only wrong, it's dangerous. https://t.co/oN0VEucc8FKudos to @aafp, @AmerAcadPeds, @acognews and @ACPinternists for issuing principles to protect the patient-physician relationship. This principle is particularly key. Keeping providers from giving patients info and options about their health is akin to legislative malpractice. https://t.co/1SB4yjtfC1Right now, you can still apply to renew your DACA. If you meet the requirements to apply for DACA renewal, you should apply → https://t.co/zezSgvAqxy https://t.co/zGIa6vH7QMDuring #NCIALobbyDays, I spoke about my work to foster the growth of the cannabis industry in Colorado and across America. Congress can protect these new jobs and opportunities by passing my bipartisan Respect States' and Citizens' Rights Act. https://t.co/pbP3V0nZDhHonored to join my colleagues in leading this letter in defense of every American's right to health care. Rolling back anti-discrimination rules in order to let providers and insurers deprive people of health care is an affront to what our country stands for: equality under law. https://t.co/EnnD4ieKHjLarry Nassar’s horrific assaults on more than 250 athletes must never happen to anyone again. At a @HouseCommerce hearing today, I questioned authorities from U.S. Olympics and other sports on what they’re doing to protect their 13 million athletes from sexual abuse. https://t.co/K7MToApOYVToday is #FosterYouthShadowDay in Congress. I’m hosting Alisiana, a bright student and former #fosteryouth from Colorado, pictured here on the far right. And it's great to see my fellow @EnergyCommerce colleagues supporting this occasion, as well. #fosteryouthvoices https://t.co/Gri8OXnOu6Today I was pleased to meet with Colorado members of @NATCA visiting Washington. I'm working to support them by opposing #GOP attempts to gut retirement benefits for air traffic controllers and other federal employees. #NATCAinWashington https://t.co/8mFxw1W9cBA nice thank-you to current U.S. military personnel and families: Between #MemorialDay and Labor Day, you’ll have free admission to #bluestarmuseums in CO and across America. It’s just one of the many ways your service and sacrifice ought to be recognized. https://t.co/12BPwUQ79uOn #ColoradoPublicLandsDay, we honor the spectacular landscapes enjoyed by Coloradans and visitors alike, and pledge to push back on @POTUS' unprecedented assault against them. One way we can do this is by passing the Colorado Wilderness Act, which I will reintroduce this summer. https://t.co/Fl3SQ1xh1OIn this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including protecting #TitleX, restoring #NetNeutrality, combating #opioids, opposing the failed #GOPFarmBill, helping CO seniors and their caregivers, and wishing #RamadanKareem to all observing the holiday. https://t.co/pXpTl0L8xY.@HHSGov hasn’t yet released the #TitleX proposed rule that would gut this program, which provides health care to the underserved. Eroding it to please the extreme anti-choice crowd would hurt many women and families. We must stay vigilant. #ProtectTitleX. https://t.co/1X4pZGp29CMore innocent lives lost. More bright futures tragically cut short. More families left to grieve. This happens far too often, and yet our leaders continue refusing to pass #gunsafety legislation to help end it. This is the moral imperative of our time. What are we waiting for? https://t.co/gKg2460gy6The Trump administration will stop at nothing to undermine women’s health. Its proposed rule on #TitleX, expected later today, has one purpose: to limit women’s access to care. It shows a callous disregard for the wellbeing of American women and families. https://t.co/OOPsP1eoaEThe #GOPFarmBill will kick 400,000 U.S. households off of #SNAP, so don’t believe the Republican claims that not a single person will lose benefits. This is just one reason I'm opposing this damaging, partisan spending bill that undermines farmers and families. https://t.co/T2cbezoolTOn #IDAHOT, we celebrate the global #LGBTQ community and recognize the work that remains to ensure their full equality around the world. Too many are justifiably fearful of living openly, facing social and legal barriers to this right. We support them on this day and every day. https://t.co/C7bsTWePa3The future of the internet is at stake in our fight against the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality. But there's good news: Senate Dems vote today to #SaveTheInternet.  I’m supporting the same legislation here in the House that will bring #NetNeutrality back. https://t.co/YpFE1mQrzf https://t.co/RmglxgH5B4Wishing a #RamadanKareem to all celebrating this important commemoration in Colorado, across America and around the world. May you grow closer to your faith, your values and your loved ones during this special time. https://t.co/xr5PS9xwuEEvery day, &gt;820 women in developing countries die due to childbirth-related complications, including #UnsafeAbortion. The #GlobalGagRule harms women in under-resourced communities, placing lifesaving #ReproHealth services out of reach. I'm working to end this policy for good. https://t.co/RZMTVR0vHnI led more than 200 of my colleagues in sending a letter to @SecAzar opposing a proposed #TitleX domestic gag rule. This edict would prevent providers from receiving Title X funds if they even mention abortion to their patients. This is unconscionable. https://t.co/2VvlhrJOMZ https://t.co/so3uvEo3EOI filed a comment to @BetsyDeVosED opposing @usedgov's delay of Equity in IDEA, which seeks to address disparities in the treatment of students of color. This gap is present in Denver public schools, and we must work to end it nationwide, despite @POTUS' attacks on these efforts. https://t.co/LlV7hCF52mToday we lost a dedicated public servant, seasoned leader, and good friend to many. Condolences to the loved ones of Mayor Stephen D. Hogan, a Colorado original who will be deeply missed.Happy #MothersDay! Our job isn't always easy, but the hard work is worth it as we love, nurture and instill good values in our kids. Thanks to my own mother who lives on through the lessons she taught me, and to my daughters. Being their mom remains my greatest joy of my life. https://t.co/q0fq5LLrGHIn this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including opposing @POTUS' #IranDeal decision, advancing legislation to improve public health, fighting #opioids, opposing #budgetcuts, taking action on local priorities, and celebrating #MothersDay. https://t.co/7v3vExj7XRPleased to work w/@RepTomReed on a bipartisan bill we've introduced to expand #Medicare coverage for #diabetes self-care training. With it, beneficiaries will learn techniques for managing and coping with this complex disease’s effects. Read the bill here: https://t.co/Pf0nfMMcqO.@POTUS' #drugprices proposal contains some good ideas, such as providing free generic drugs to seniors, but in true Trump fashion, offers flash with little substance. His #GOPTaxScam handed pharmaceutical companies a huge tax break, and this plan gives back little to consumers.Today I convened a meeting with local stakeholders to address high lead levels in drinking water in some Denver homes caused by corrosion of lead pipes. Our productive discussion brings us a step closer to fixing this public health threat. https://t.co/KYVri1pDMaWhat moms need: Quality, coordinated, woman-centered #healthcare. What #momsdontneed: Continued attacks on the #ACA, #Medicaid and Planned Parenthood. @POTUS and the GOP Congress should remember this on #MothersDay and every day. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/yLmkfbOhJeAs leader of the @ProChoiceCaucus, I #ActForWomen every day in part by championing smart legislation such as the Women's Health Protection Act. We must ensure that women are protected from anti-choice politicians in all 50 states. https://t.co/Ydr7t2LKP4#Reprorights are a priority for most Americans, and yet they’re under siege by the Trump admin. and congressional GOP. As @SecAzar prepares to testify in the Senate today, I joined @PPFA leaders, senators and fellow House members in decrying @HHSgov attacks on women’s rights. https://t.co/yVVaCyITC9Today @HouseGOP refused to address the price of prescription drugs. Meanwhile, Americans continue to suffer under crippling costs. That’s a raw deal. The American people deserve #ABetterDeal on this priority and many more. https://t.co/iMyGZ7drZXWhile my Democratic colleagues and I work for greater protections &amp; services for student loan borrowers - 776,000 in Colorado alone - this administration shuns them to serve corporate interests. The next generation deserves better: We should set them up for success, debt-free. https://t.co/JvQ97uZLVEThe @FCC took away a free and open Internet. Today, Senate Democrats are one step closer to forcing a vote to #SaveTheInternet. I’m supporting legislation here in the House that will bring #NetNeutrality back.  We must ensure equity for all online. https://t.co/ef0aW7mKNGNeedless delays in bringing safe over-the-counter medicines to market will soon be a thing of the past, now that @HouseCommerce has passed my bipartisan bill streamlining the way @US_FDA reviews such medicines (H.R. 5333). Now let's make it law. https://t.co/APQf4tlIZ7 https://t.co/aehFTAk7lRWhile @POTUS and his Cabinet live the high life, he's asking the #GOP Congress to strip $15 billion from programs that help the vulnerable, such as #CHIP and public housing support. This heartless administration asks everyone to sacrifice except the president and his cronies. https://t.co/FWtljYMT8mToday, I was pleased to meet with a group of Colorado members of @NationalNurses. They're visiting Washington to advocate for #MedicareForAll and better workplace safety, both of which will improve our health care system for patients and those who care for them. #NursesWeek https://t.co/7vOxujZS2l.@POTUS' #sanctions announcement is a setback both for U.S. international leadership and global stability. The #IranDeal is designed to maintain the goal of a non-nuclear #Iran; we shouldn’t break our obligations now, but should instead work w/ other countries toward that goal. https://t.co/oHxR51trwzWeeks after giving tax breaks to the wealthy through the #GOPTaxScam, the #Trumpbudget was released; it guts housing benefits for families struggling to pay rent. This is wrong, plain and simple. Affordable housing is a right. #OurHomesOurVoices #CutsHurt https://t.co/8SqVxTwynpThe Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, where I serve as ranking member, is questioning #opioid pill distributors to determine the root causes of egregious pill dumping in WV. We need answers to aid similar investigations in Colorado and to end #opioid abuse for good. https://t.co/VpE9DBm3yyOn #TeacherAppreciationDay, I thank every educator, including my late mother, who has chosen to educate and inspire people of every age. But our gratitude isn't enough. We must ensure teachers have the tools they need to help their students succeed. We can do much more. https://t.co/mk1g1KEXs7Tune in as I hold major drug distributors accountable at this morning’s hearing on #opioid dumping in WVa, #Colorado and other states. What did they know, and when? Why didn’t they report suspiciously large orders to @DEAHQ &amp; @TheJusticeDept as required? https://t.co/fzDsXYSDzLIn a desperate effort to appear fiscally responsible, @POTUS is urging his #GOP allies to sacrifice health care for children from low-income homes. It’s an attack on the most vulnerable among us. We must fight to save #CHIP from this cruel chopping block. https://t.co/yC40QAqkHiI sent a letter to @EPAScottPruitt demanding more information on his shady real estate transactions in Oklahoma and Washington. Recent reports show he left out vital details on these shady dealings when I questioned him about them last week. #BootPruitt https://t.co/RKA5v7rpd5 https://t.co/vleQO0fLDnI've requested local, state and federal stakeholders join me on May 11 for a meeting to determine the best plan of action to lower lead levels in Denver’s drinking water. Corrosive pipes are the culprit, and we need to fix this quickly to protect public health. https://t.co/wfVirpHDTIIt will take all of us to change the future of health.

He’s always been a real pro. Throughout the paper's recent struggles, he has offered a brave and passionate voice in defense of good journalism. We hear you, Chuck. #pressfreedomGreat to again gather with African American leaders in our community for a wide-ranging lunch discussion. We'll keep working together to achieve progress on equitable health care, #gunsafety, discrimination, voting rights, affordable housing and more despite #GOP opposition. https://t.co/ESThOwt5fYI grilled @EPAScottPruitt on his ethical lapses last week, and now more are piling up. @EnergyCommerce colleagues and I today sent him a letter demanding answers regarding his landlord's alleged influence on critical @EPA appointments. https://t.co/KA1R3jxaWj https://t.co/aDUAiyyvsCOn #WorldPressFreedomDay , I enjoyed meeting with reporters and editors from a variety of local community papers to answer their questions about my work in Congress. It was a productive discussion, and I thank them for their important work keeping Coloradans informed. https://t.co/PZlTNOVxHLI'm sharing highlights from Tuesday's live telephone town hall. In this clip, I speak about what it will take to pass a #climatechange bill in Congress. GOP leadership has blocked this effort, but I've been building coalitions to ensure action is taken if Dems win back the House. https://t.co/4bbTeOx4FNWhat a wonderful night celebrating @parkhillnews and its staff. Since 1961, this paper has helped create a more vibrant community in Denver's Park Hill neighborhood while keeping residents informed. Today, on #WorldPressFreedomDay, and every day, it's worth supporting. https://t.co/thraOleSDVToday I joined experts from @CO_CDHS and @SwedishMedical to discuss the federal response to the #opioid crisis. Many hospitals want to give patients an alternative to opioids from the start, and my bipartisan bill, H.R. 5197, can aid in this effort. https://t.co/c69GZZxH3RMay is #AsianPacificAmericanHeritageMonth, an occasion to celebrate this diverse and dynamic group of Americans numbering more than 22 million. For centuries, they've shaped Colorado communities while working to achieve the American dream, and we pledge to support them. #APAHM https://t.co/16IDhvpQhpMy live telephone town hall is about to begin.

You can still stream it live at https://t.co/RzOWMCNvss. https://t.co/BjdRVhtrcn.@EPA’s announcement today that our region is out of compliance with ozone standards set in 2015 is only a first step toward reducing pollution.

Understanding the U.S. Constitution is vital, now and for all time. #WTPFinals @DPSNewsNow#TakeBackDay makes it easy to safely dispose of unused prescription drugs.

The House just passed my legislation giving airports greater ability to develop their non-federal property, as long as it doesn't hinder FAA efforts to operate them safely and efficiently. Removing this red tape helps airports raise revenue and improve infrastructure.I asked @EPAScottPruitt about some of his shady dealings at an @EnergyCommerce hearing. He tried to dodge these questions, but I wouldn't let him get away with it. It's Congress' duty to hold fellow public servants accountable when they betray the public trust. #BootPruitt https://t.co/ydPVS8cPXN.@EPAScottPruitt’s ethical lapses continue to pile up. @USGAO concluded EPA broke the law in constructing Pruitt’s $43,000 “privacy booth.” I just questioned him at @EnergyCommerce, and will keep working to hold him accountable for the shady dealings under his watch. #BootPruitt https://t.co/7nQfZF8ofzGood to see these folks giving @EPAScottPruitt a warm welcome as he arrives at Capitol Hill. He's testifying before the @EnergyCommerce committee, and my Democratic colleagues and I plan to get answers from him about his many ethical lapses. #BootPruitt https://t.co/0zmsZK8IDRGOP @HouseCommerce leaders are attempting to remedy their slow response to the #opioid epidemic by hastily marking up more than 60 bills. They should look to #21stCenturyCures as a model for thorough, bipartisan policymaking that can save lives – not this mad-dash approach. https://t.co/p7bHCSjHuSNewly-released data from @usedgov reveals that African American students are disproportionately disciplined in Denver public schools, further contributing to the cycle of racism. The district is working to reverse this trend, but more must be done. https://t.co/DuL5RlXpoeVive la science! @EmmanuelMacron#SCOTUS has the opportunity to strike down @POTUS' discriminatory #MuslimBan for good. I hope they heed the warnings of countless Americans, refugees and national security experts who have long said this unlawful, heartless edict isn't making us any safer. https://t.co/xF7imVEJ55Thanks @MelMcIntire and @RollCall for a good discussion of how this country can achieve quality, affordable health care for all. There are potential bipartisan solutions to the high cost of care, including rising drug prices; it will take political will to see them through.We’re about to start.

You make us proud. https://t.co/nVRNNi0qls.@US_FDA's crackdown on the sale of e-cigs to minors is a good start, but the agency should also ban the manufacture of all flavored e-cigs, which often get kids on the path to addiction.

Step 3) They profit twice while the middle class suffers

Across our state for nearly two decades, families and communities have been traumatized time and again. This nation must enact more sensible gun safety measures to avoid such tragedies. #NationalSchoolWalkout https://t.co/lxXVzWqFUsI’ve joined more than 100 House members protesting @JusticeDept plans to end two programs that provide vital legal assistance to #immigrants.

My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family during this difficult time..@EPAScottPruitt's ethical lapses continue to mount: a free stay at @TheBroadmoor luxury resort thanks to Colorado developers whom he briefed on his many environmental rollbacks. Shady dealings such as these point to a pattern for Mr. Pruitt. https://t.co/8xmOUeI4Eg.@EPAScottPruitt found his predecessors’ official car fell short of his standards.

This tragic chapter reminds us of our responsibility to oppose discrimination, injustice and any form of fascism - before it's too late. #YomHaShoah2018 https://t.co/oV3aFGgrkSAs the 2018 hurricane season approaches, the electric grid in #PuertoRico and #USVI is still not completely restored following #Maria's damage last year. This is unacceptable. At a @HouseCommerce hearing, I stressed the need to repair and modernize this American infrastructure. https://t.co/N3kWkC2cvfAs founder and CEO of #Facebook, #MarkZuckerberg appears to be strangely uninformed about how little the company has been required to pay out in previous #privacy lawsuits. My questions and his answers reveal the need for a stronger regulatory framework to protect users’ data. https://t.co/COU6AeUiBwAn especially revealing moment during my line of questioning to #MarkZuckerberg. Clearly, there is no incentive for #Facebook to self-regulate and better protect consumers' personal data. Privacy violations are apparently just the cost of doing business. https://t.co/BUKhHfmOMPIn a few minutes, I'll ask tough questions of #Facebook CEO #MarkZuckerberg about what must be done to better protect personal data online. Things have to change, and not just at Facebook, to ensure everyone's safety. Watch the hearing live here: https://t.co/fzObBxX9ss https://t.co/fItKg7q5aiI'm prepared to ask #MarkZuckerberg tough but important questions about Americans' data security when he comes before @HouseCommerce shortly. As co-chair of the Privacy Caucus, I've long been focused on this issue and expect today will be a step toward stronger safeguards.#MarkZuckerberg testifies before @HouseCommerce tomorrow about Facebook's use and protection of personal data, and the questions to him you've submitted on my social media will help guide my own line of questioning. If you haven't already, tell me what you'd like to ask him. https://t.co/gPs2C1nTRIOn #EqualPayDay, we confront the double burden of sexism &amp; racism in the fight to achieve pay equity. Women on average earn 80 cents to every dollar earned by a man, but the gap is even wider for black women and Latinas. Equality is far away, but we'll keep working to achieve it. https://t.co/oS3ZUlkrvPAt our request, five Inspector General inquiries are taking place regarding @EPAScottPruitt's actions. He is the poster child for the ethical challenges of this administration, headed by a man who pledged to drain the swamp. Scott Pruitt IS the swamp, and it's time for him to go. https://t.co/CinJb7CavGU.S. deficit is ballooning thanks largely to the #GOPTaxScam giveaway to corporations and the ultra-wealthy, plus the hastily-passed $1.3 trillion #omnibus spending bill. This week, the GOP will try to save face with a cosmetic balanced budget amendment. We're not fooled. https://t.co/vqyvMtuUYS#Naloxone is useful to fight #opioid abuse, but it does little to end the cycle of addiction. The @Surgeon_General, @POTUS and all our leaders must do more to tackle this epidemic where it starts, instead of outsourcing emergency response to the public. https://t.co/6wGFwQ7d0xToday is the last day to submit your artwork to my district office for the Congressional Art Competition. The winner will travel to Washington, where your art will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol. I'm looking forward to seeing this year's entries. https://t.co/WZZLPU59Po https://t.co/pyInEUhSxxAs more info about @EPAScottPruitt's ethically iffy actions comes to light, the importance of getting answers becomes ever greater. In reply to our previous requests, @EPA’s Inspector General has launched inquiries into Pruitt's activities and he must answer this call as well. https://t.co/JSKmIclyii.@EPAScottPruitt's dishonest dealings as head of @EPA continue to keep pace with his wanton disregard for our environment. @Washingtonpost reports he used a provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act to bring his cronies on board at the agency. #BootPruitt https://t.co/LUxeZ1kp2dIt’s time to #BootPruitt. @EPAScottPruitt should step down or be fired. From reckless spending to cozy relationships with industry to unusual personnel practices, he continues to undermine @EPA's mission and morale. It's time to restore integrity to the agency. https://t.co/RIr3PmwjWTMark Zuckerberg’s first appearance before Congress is next week. He’ll testify to @EnergyCommerce about @facebook's use and protection of personal data, esp. given the @CamAnalytica scandal. RT with the questions you'd like him to answer. I'll work to ensure your voice is heard. https://t.co/tp4a8IrWrUDr. King's life was tragically cut short 50 years ago, but the global movement for equality he inspired lives on. As we reflect on the legacy of this iconic American, we thank him for making us better by boldly revealing persistent inequality and challenging us to end it. #MLK50 https://t.co/Vrb4n5iyjJ.@EPAScottPruitt should step down or be fired. He's crossed too many ethical lines, from reckless spending to cozy relationships with industry to unusual personnel practices undermining @EPA mission and morale. I’m done asking questions. Time for him to go. https://t.co/Trei022bBu.@EPA is rolling back standards for light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emissions &amp; fuel economy. This will boost oil consumption, increase air pollution and cost drivers more at the pump. I support the Clean and Efficient Cars Act, which would reverse @EPAScottPruitt’s rollback. https://t.co/j7N4eTxAWRIs @EPAScottPruitt getting a sweet deal on housing at below-market rates from an energy industry lobbyist – and if so, has this influenced decisions he’s made at @EPA? I’m looking into it together with @EnergyCommerce colleagues
https://t.co/Mva9uDc8T1 https://t.co/k3cWSf67f3On #CesarChavezDay, we honor the life and legacy of this iconic leader whose efforts helped achieve economic and social justice for so many. His message still rings true as we carry on his work to empower the underrepresented in America and around the world. https://t.co/lbV5eDQFn9Including a citizenship question in the #2020Census will suppress participation. As a result, immigrant communities will be deprived of fair representation and vital government programs for health, education and more. https://t.co/TcYqRR6WmMOn this #OpeningDay, our hope springs eternal for the @Rockies. Here’s to the start of a great season! https://t.co/y2WlFhDggF.@EPAScottPruitt has treated himself to the high life on the taxpayers' dime while working to harm public health &amp; the environment. My @EnergyCommerce colleagues and I are investigating these reckless spending habits. Our work has prompted reviews by the EPA Inspector General. https://t.co/XhXWehar2R35,000 people are killed every year in this country by #gunviolence, and none must be forgotten. 19 years after Daniel Mauser and 12 others were killed in Columbine, we must unite to #endgunviolence for good. For Daniel, and for every victim, we say #NeverAgain. https://t.co/zsZI9kH16KI joined more than 100 @HouseDemocrats in sending a letter to @SecAzar demanding @HHSGov withdraw its Refusal of Care rule, which would make it easier for health care providers to discriminate against women &amp; #LGBTQ. Doctors must always #PutPatientsFirst. https://t.co/lI9ZH2Mwe4 https://t.co/etBe48k2e4Congrats to @DenverHealthMed, which has been named an #LGBTQ Healthcare Equality Leader this year, earning a perfect score from @HRC. Hospitals must be attuned to the unique needs of their #LGBTQ patients and staff, and I commend this local health facility for leading the way. https://t.co/tGnffymVBJThe Trump administration's move to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census is a shameless attempt to deprive immigrant communities of civil rights, fair representation, and vital gov't programs. We must fight to ensure all can stand and be counted. https://t.co/ppBtY2bx6E https://t.co/81zi2W2pwGAt @EPARegion8 headquarters in Denver today, I demanded that agency leaders halt environmental rollbacks and end their wasteful spending. While @EPAScottPruitt throws taxpayer money at flying first class, the health of Colorado's lands and its people suffer. https://t.co/d2lRYKaewY.@Sunrun is helping fuel CO's alternative energy boom, and today I was pleased to tour their Denver design center and speak with staff about my work supporting #solarpower. This includes cosponsoring the #LiftAmericaAct and opposing @POTUS' broad tariff on imported solar panels. https://t.co/wHeYhqlxziAbhorrent. It’s clear @POTUS is doubling down on his bigotry to distract from his crumbling presidency. It won't work. This is the same #transban that was blocked by the courts, and we'll keep fighting to end it for good. https://t.co/Ma8t00pIybIn this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including the hastily passed #omnibus, getting answers on #opioids, supporting #reprorights at #SCOTUS, celebrating #21stCenturyCures and wishing #ACA a happy eighth anniversary. https://t.co/JPf1SDMkOg.@POTUS' appointment of @AmbJohnBolton to serve as National Security Advisor is disastrous. He could not secure Senate confirmation to become UN Ambassador in 2005, he refuses to acknowledge #Russia's meddling in our elections and he has vilified our intelligence community.#HBD to the #AffordableCareAct, which was signed into law eight years ago today. It has weathered numerous repeal attempts by Republicans, who still work to sabotage and weaken it. But it has survived thanks to millions of Americans united to #ProtectOurCare. Let's keep it up. https://t.co/DXhuzkxdSNThe GOP-led Congress has tried many times to repeal the #ACA. Failing that, they and the President continue to sabotage the law by weakening it wherever possible rather than working with Dems to improve it. Nearly eight years on, the fight continues to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/Hl6CKD1ciSHonored to receive the @usafmc's Statesmanship Award this evening for my bipartisan work w/ @RepFredUpton on #21stCenturyCures. Recognition from such a distinguished group of public servants speaks to the resonance of this groundbreaking law, which is already helping save lives. https://t.co/Ak2LCqBlDnIn our ongoing review of @EPAScottPruitt's luxury travel, my colleagues and I have learned that his security detail has also accompanied him on first class flights. He needs to explain this and more when he appears before @EnergyCommerce next month. https://t.co/fdgIJzradVKids cannot learn if they are constantly worried or fearful of discrimination. That's why I am once again cosponsoring the Student Non-Discrimination Act, which helps protect #LGBTQ students across America by prohibiting this abuse. #LetKidsLearn #SNDA https://t.co/893OvMF5AIAt @EnergyCommerce second hearing of the week on the #opioids crisis, I questioned a panel of experts representing @CDCGov, @samhsagov and @US_FDA, about ways to improve the efficacy of policies and programs meant to curb this epidemic. #21stCenturyCures is helping this mission. https://t.co/daddkHzf3wHad a chance to catch up with two Centennial State visitors representing @NARALColorado, here in DC for a rally as oral arguments in #NIFLAvBecerra started at #SCOTUS. I’m proud to have led the amicus brief arguing for transparency and #reprorights in this case. https://t.co/4TMyayR2LdThe Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee today examined @DEAHQ's failure to keep manufacturers from shipping millions of #opioid pills to small West Virginia pharmacies. I asked agency officials how this happened. We must stop such pill dumping in WV and across the country. https://t.co/PKOOA7U5fP#6MonthsAfterMaria #PuertoRico and its islands are still in crisis. National attention may have waned, but tens of thousands of our fellow Americans remain without permanent shelter, water or electricity. As hurricane season approaches, I'll continue working to provide relief. https://t.co/Brcmrv3wK515 years ago, our country invaded #Iraq, a move I opposed in one of my proudest votes in Congress. The loss of life among U.S. troops, our allies, and innocent Iraqi civilians has been far greater than anyone predicted. I pray we've learned from this costly and ongoing mistake.Congratulations to all the Colorado Paralympians who contributed to #TeamUSA’s amazing performance – including Tyler Carron and @Nikko1515, who helped propel the U.S. sled hockey team to its third gold medal in a row. To us, you all are champions! https://t.co/fn3uXDrmYgNo matter who wins this poll, the contest that counts is coming up this Saturday. Best of luck to @DU_Hockey as our home team fights to make it to the #FrozenFour and once again claim the title of National Champions. Go Pios! https://t.co/tZfyuuMee1Congratulations to my colleague @RepMarcyKaptur, who has just become the longest serving woman in the House of Representatives. Thank you for blazing a trail for women from all walks of life to run for office, make a difference and empower their communities. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/6zxkfN2ZDuA wide array of Coloradans took part in today’s community forum. Among them: these young people with @BridgeProjectCO, which helps children living in Denver public housing neighborhoods achieve their dreams through access to higher education and trade schools. https://t.co/KLqg4DumuyThanks to all who took part in our community forum today. We covered a lot of ground. For those who were unable to attend, the video is on my Facebook page: https://t.co/z2UUhyd1t1 https://t.co/RflXz7xxdGLooking forward to my community forum today - come join us! RSVP here: https://t.co/gPDHJhPDcb https://t.co/JaX2HM71qUIn this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including my efforts supporting common-sense #gunsafety reforms, promoting government transparency and keeping you informed via last Monday’s telephone town hall and this Sunday’s community forum. https://t.co/6I7C2pn2N9The passing of my fellow @ProChoiceCaucus co-chair and colleague, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, is a tremendous loss. She was a warrior for all the issues she cared about, particularly the crusade for #reprorights. I’ll miss her wisdom and wit every day. https://t.co/2Igv8Er7O1It's not too late to RSVP for my next community forum this Sunday. I'm looking forward to a great discussion on many issues, from the #GOPTaxScam to the battles to #ProtectDreamers, pass #gunsafety legislation and more. RSVP here -&gt; https://t.co/gPDHJhPDcb https://t.co/TXLCauAm19Great to meet with Colorado members of @NACHC to discuss the critical importance of protecting #CHCs, #340B and #Medicaid. I’m honored to receive their Distinguished Community Health Advocate Award. I'll continue working in Congress to ensure these lifelines are strengthened. https://t.co/YRLG4EGCoC#HBD to Supreme Court Justice #RuthBaderGinsburg, aka #NotoriousRBG, a defender of progressive values and a pioneer for women in the field of law. I've admired her since my own days as a civil rights lawyer and still find inspiration in her fierce commitment to equality. https://t.co/mhG3vVky1eIt's vital we get big money and hidden special interests out of politics, but the GOP is working to increase their influence. That's why I joined more than 100 members of Congress in opposing their actions. Government should be accountable to all people, not the privileged few. https://t.co/5VG1wOsYRrI'm immensely proud of the students in our community and others across America who took part in #NationalWalkoutDay. Peaceful protest is a powerful means to enact lasting change. These kids were willing to get into some "good trouble," as @RepJohnLewis would say. @DPSNewsNow https://t.co/7quEv4qdWpOne month after #Parkland, I'm standing in solidarity with students in Colorado and across America protesting #gunviolence at the #EnoughIsEnough rally at the U.S. Capitol. These kids are demanding Congress buck the @NRA and pass #gunsafety legislation. We won't let them down. https://t.co/NhL68yF4V87,000 pairs of kids' shoes on the U.S. Capitol lawn represent the young lives lost to #gunviolence since Sandy Hook. Columbine victim Danny Mauser is also honored; his dad, Tom, wears these shoes in his memory nearly 19 years later. One month after #Parkland, we say #NeverAgain. https://t.co/eZUOAmzHBJDuring last night's telephone town hall, a caller asked how people can ensure their voice positively influences what's happening in DC. I suggest calling my office, where a real person will work to address your questions and concerns. No endless voicemail loop here. https://t.co/URh0cEkAzCI enjoyed speaking with nearly 3,000 of you at yesterday's telephone town hall, where I answered your questions on a variety of topics, including our broken immigration system. We must ensure fair and compassionate reforms for #Dreamers and all undocumented in this country. https://t.co/flNhxUpBE4Yesterday: Russia “clearly” behind Skripal poisoning.
Today: Fired via tweet.
#TillersonOutThanks again to the 2800 people who took part in today's tele-town hall. We covered a lot of ground; I'll share some highlights over the next couple days. In this excerpt, I discuss potential bipartisan solutions to the challenges that the U.S. health care system faces. https://t.co/sWVhcnPcx3My telephone town hall for aging adults and their caregivers is happening now. Call in by dialing 866-383-2726 or stream and ask questions online here: https://t.co/RzOWMCNvss https://t.co/xj2ezkgrfJ.@POTUS' refusal to hold the Russian government accountable is an outrage, setting the stage for possible future attacks on our elections in Colorado and across America. We're demanding he do his job and impose sanctions on Russia to protect the integrity of our democracy. https://t.co/rqIBLw1MKrToday I met in Denver with representatives of the @AmDiabetesAssn and @TheEndoSociety to discuss insulin pricing. The cost of this life-saving drug is skyrocketing, &amp; I'm conducting an inquiry to find answers and solutions with my fellow Diabetes Caucus co-chair, @RepTomReed. https://t.co/FDBuJ4Yzvr.@POTUS' infrastructure proposal would gut bedrock environmental, clean water, and clean air protections under the guise of speeding up projects. Don't be fooled by his shoddy #InfrastructureScam; we need real programs that create jobs while protecting our environment.What's happening in Washington has significant impact in Colorado. I'm convening a community forum this Sunday, March 18, to discuss these issues and more. Your thoughts and ideas are important, and I'd love to hear them. RSVP here: https://t.co/gPDHJi7e3J https://t.co/xy0kcyUy34It's not too late to sign up for my telephone town hall for aging adults and their caregivers this afternoon. I'll be discussing my work in Congress and answering your questions. Register to receive a call or stream it live. Talk to you soon! https://t.co/bqsT2KrQJESaddened at the passing of #DorothyHeight, a champion for women and African Americans for nearly eight decades. Through it all, she fought to unite the oppressed in the struggle for equality. We thank her for a lifetime of service and pledge to build upon her legacy.In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including my ongoing work to protect #Dreamers, an inquiry into possible conflicts of interest at @EPA, sharing info on upcoming local events I'm hosting, and celebrating #InternationalWomensDay. https://t.co/eonXv4MSKVThe effort to #ProtectDreamers continues. I’ve just updated Coloradans who are engaged in this fight about my ongoing work to pass the #DreamAct. Among other things, this bill would provide a pathway to citizenship. Advocacy in DC and communities across the country is helping. https://t.co/U333CN2ABQToday the #Paralympics began in #PyeongChang, and Colorado is well represented with 14 athletes on #TeamUSA -- more than any other state. I'm sending best wishes to all these men and women, whose perseverance and skill help them triumph over adversity. You are all winners! https://t.co/NNVn6FIkiYOn Monday, March 12 at 4 p.m. MT, I’ll hold a live telephone town hall to answer your questions about my work in Congress. Register in advance to receive a call when the event begins, or watch it live. I'm looking forward to this important discussion. https://t.co/bqsT2KrQJE https://t.co/uRajLwv1fSAt an Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing, I questioned experts about persistent obstacles to fighting flu outbreaks. They spoke of the need to update vaccine-development methods, which Congress must work to support. @EnergyCommerce @SGottliebFDA @CDCDirector https://t.co/IGPpiSKNN1Happy #InternationalWomensDay! The theme of this year's commemoration is #PressForProgress, highlighting the ongoing efforts to achieve gender parity worldwide by ensuring access to education, health care, #reprorights, equal pay and more. Equality is in everyone's interest. https://t.co/tAFKIpwtwBWonderful news! The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the rights of #trans individuals to be protected under the Civil Rights Act. Now Congress should pass the #EqualityAct to ensure #LGBTQ people are covered under this landmark law nationwide. https://t.co/tA3WysVYN8It's clear the #GOP doesn't want to talk about #gunviolence, but Americans are demanding that Congress address this epidemic. I joined @EnergyCommerce Dems in sending a letter to Chairman @repgregwalden requesting hearings to tackle the issue. https://t.co/4ZhMFFvbNDFellow Democrats on @EnergyCommerce and I have written to Chairman @repgregwalden: Hold hearings on #gunviolence now. It’s the committee’s duty to address critical issues within its jurisdiction, and we must tackle this nationwide public health crisis. https://t.co/4ZhMFFvbNDThe Violence Against Women Act, which I proudly supported, was reauthorized five years ago today. Congress needs to renew this historic law again before it expires this fall, and this country must continue working to end domestic violence. #VAWACurrent and former firemen are visiting DC on behalf of the Colorado Professional Fire Fighters. I'm working hard to pass legislation that helps these everyday heroes, including #HR931, a bipartisan bill that establishes the first national cancer registry for firefighters. https://t.co/BbrdRgkMl4FACT: Democrats have offered 23 motions to bring the #DREAMAct up for a vote in the House. @HouseGOP has blocked every single one. Running? Hardly. We are standing firm to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/3huBz3ZSGaPleased to deliver opening remarks at @ACLAlabs' annual meeting, where I spoke about my ongoing efforts in Congress to advance patients' access to life-saving diagnostics, including working to pass the bipartisan Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act w/@RepLarryBucshon. #ACLA18 https://t.co/F8T2OTmxiwThe #congressionalartcompetition is underway, and all eligible high school students in our community with a passion for visual arts are encouraged to apply.

Details here: https://t.co/YaBc11OuyO https://t.co/hxkU9nbUsSSenior @EPA appointees, including one from Colorado, are moonlighting as political consultants, raising serious concerns that their outside work could compromise the agency’s mission. I’m demanding answers together with fellow @EnergyCommerce leaders. https://t.co/GfIiCB5w0bCongrats to native Coloradan (and family friend) Bryan Fogel, whose @IcarusNetflix earned the #Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Thank you for highlighting the serious problem of #doping in athletics; you’ve inspired my ongoing work in Congress on this issue. Kudos to you!Today the @Selma50Jubilee includes a reenactment of the bridge crossing from #Selma to Montgomery. I followed that path 20 years ago with the formidable @RepJohnLewis and our congressional colleagues. The struggle for justice continues as we commemorate this historic moment. https://t.co/JEBgCzMw2bIn this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including working in Washington and Colorado to end #gunviolence, fighting to restore #NetNeutrality, taking action on #opioid abuse, protecting our #Dreamers and celebrating #WomensHistoryMonth. https://t.co/wr7Xgm7lvEStudents at @denversouthhigh are committed to ending #gunviolence for good! I'm here to discuss my work in Congress to pass #gunsafety legislation, which has been strengthened by the passionate advocacy of young people working to achieve real and lasting change. @DPSNewsNow https://t.co/i0CN2JSopgStarting the day off right with a visit to Denver's La Casita for a Cafecito Coffee, a collaborative gathering of Latina businesswomen. I was pleased to speak with this influential group about my work promoting economic empowerment &amp; entrepreneurship, protecting #Dreamers &amp; more. https://t.co/cELba0qShKLooking forward to visiting @denversouthhigh, my alma mater, for a discussion today with students about my work on #gunsafety, their concerns, and how they can help end mass shootings. Their efforts in the wake of the tragedy in #Parkland have been impressive. @DPSNewsNowOne year ago today, @SecretaryZinke was confirmed to head @Interior, and in that time has launched an assault on our public lands, shrinking our national monuments and working to open them for mining and drilling. #WhatWouldTeddySay? Probably a few choice words. #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/D4Srz0cF30This #WomensHistoryMonth , we honor every woman who has worked to improve our world and advance gender equality. Many of their battles are not yet won, and it's up to us to continue the fight. We can all play a historic role in advancing women’s rights when we are united. https://t.co/7OqlVP1EwfA reminder that under the leadership of @EPAScottPruitt, scientific #censorship continues. This is what the #ClimateChange page on @EPA's website looks like now. #DefendClimate https://t.co/h6OCETAckF https://t.co/uOmowqezAiI've never been afraid of the @NRA. It’s heartening now to see more and more colleagues stand up to them. A record 200 of us are cosponsoring the bipartisan #ThompsonKing Background Checks Bill that strengthens the system and helps keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.Republicans promised their #GOPTaxScam would make filing easier, but it's causing confusion for employers and employees alike. @IRSnews has announced an online calculator to check withholdings; use it to ensure you're not overpaying or underpaying #taxes. https://t.co/DRqJO8XUrMYet another reason why @SecretaryAzar should #FireScottLloyd. https://t.co/xvJsvRhoEPTrump appointee Scott Lloyd denies undocumented immigrants have rights to care that @SCOTUS has affirmed. He reportedly gets a spreadsheet each week w/info on pregnant teens in custody, including whether they’ve asked for abortions. Outrageous overreach. 
https://t.co/SK4v0QohkvDrug take-back programs, including those organized by @corxconsortium, can help communities tackle #opioid abuse, but only 3% of @DEAHQ-registered facilities conduct them. At today's Health Subcommittee hearing, I asked an official of the agency why these challenges persist. https://t.co/rR89pyOZZcWith @ScottBlackmun leaving, I'll ensure his USOC successor presses on with reforms to prevent further sexual abuse and mistreatment, and provides answers to the questions on these matters that @housecommerce colleagues and I have raised. https://t.co/xz3MGp82ECReydesel, a Colorado #Dreamer, settled in the U.S. when he was 10 and grew up in a mixed-status family. He graduated from East High School, but had to put college on hold until #DACA gave him a path forward. He is now an award-winning student at @CUDenver. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/iDQpaTmDGeToday we introduced legislation in the House and Senate to overturn the @FCC's repeal of #NetNeutrality protections. Coloradans have made it clear they want Congress to preserve these safeguards that help small businesses and consumers alike. We must work to #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/6ix0ROy2L7I’m demanding @SecAzar fire Scott Lloyd for trying to keep vulnerable teens from accessing abortions. Today I joined @AdvocatesTweets in signing his pink slip &amp; supporting their #1in3 campaign, all part of our ongoing efforts to protect #reprorights and seek #JusticeForJane. https://t.co/ruSKohKPtG.@FCC is moving forward with a plan to gut #NetNeutrality; it's critical that we push back now. I'm supporting legislation that will protect #NetNeutrality and #SaveTheInternet for Coloradans and every American. https://t.co/owGgJai2K9Proud to be an original author of the Keep Americans Safe Act (H.R. 4052), a bill making it illegal to purchase or acquire magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. I've long advocated for these types of #gunsafety measures because they make sense and can save lives. https://t.co/eugQ9ImuTFMaria, a Colorado #Dreamer, was born in Mexico City and immigrated with her family to Lakewood, Colorado at age three. She graduated from Jefferson High School and is now a receptionist for an immigration law firm. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/Fpn2dD545ZCongrats to all the Olympians from Colorado who competed in #PyeongChang2018. You’ve done your country proud. We look forward to welcoming you home to celebrate in the Centennial State!Though we don't yet know the details of Secretary Mattis' recommendation, one can only hope it is a clear rebuke of @POTUS' discriminatory #transban, signaling  a continued march toward #LGBTQ equality.  If not, we’ll just keep marching. https://t.co/NGPYWYqJIHWonderful news! @POTUS' effort to scrap this smart Obama-era rule was simply a favor to big business and not based in real evidence. I'm pleased that Judge William Orrick recognized this and ruled accordingly. Our public lands will be healthier for now, but our fight continues. https://t.co/wENYuQrqCD.@FCC is forging ahead with its reckless #NetNeutrality repeal, placing the order today in the Federal Register, giving us only 60 days to reverse the plan before it largely goes into effect. The clock is ticking. Congress must act now to prevent this. https://t.co/SBw9ZeDLt5 https://t.co/W5lT14PUMLBernabe, a #Colorado Dreamer, immigrated with his family from Mexico more than a decade ago. He is a lead immigration paralegal for a local law firm and is enrolled at @msudenver with plans to attend law school. He is also active in local #LGBTQ groups. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/3l4WdlC4bqMoments of silence, thoughts and prayers aren’t enough to commemorate the 17 slain in the #ParklandShooting or any senseless massacre. Congress must do right by them and pass #gunsafety legislation so no community knows this anguish again. #ParklandTownHall #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/rrxOkkUPey#HBD to my good friend and Conscience of the Congress, @repjohnlewis! Whether marching from Selma to Montgomery, leading @HouseDemocrats in a historic sit-in and more for #gunsafety, or inspiring other kinds of “good trouble,” you remain a bedrock of moral leadership. https://t.co/inngEfm8O4A day after @POTUS proposed slashing @EPA budget 23%, @EPAScottPruitt took a 1st Class flight for work.
