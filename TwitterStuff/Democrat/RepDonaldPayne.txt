DV recipients, particularly those from African countries, are  well-educated; and all  Diversity Visa recipients must pass a stringent  background  investigation. 3/President Trump’s so-called ‘pillars of immigration’ are an example  of his divisive agenda. The President called for Congress to eliminate  the Diversity Visa Program, which is an important tool to maintain  fairness in our nation’s #immigration policy. 2/We all knew @POTUS @realDonaldTrump can read, but the question is whether he can lead. His State of the Union address called for unity, but the President’s agenda and policies have divided the country. Actions speak louder than words. 1/The Diversity Visa Program provides opportunities for people to achieve the American Dream. DV recipients are vetted, and they contribute to our economy. #Trump’s racist worldview may represent the Alt-Right, but it doesn’t represent the American People. #SOTUclapback #SOTU@realDonaldTrump It’s clear #Trump doesn’t understand and doesn’t want to understand structural inequalities facing people of color. Shame! #SOTUclapback 2/2@realDonaldTrump wants credit for the reduction in African-American unemployment, but the trend began long before he entered office. His tax policies will actually harm minorities communities in the long run. #SOTU 1/Strangers shouldn’t have to save strangers from gun violence. The #GOP should stop kissing the #NRA’s ring and pass meaningful gun reform.

 @realDonaldTrump #unfit#Republicans need to start governing instead of blaming everything bad on President #Obama. There isn't an Obama boogeyman in the White House...there's a Republican there. When the @HouseGOP is ready to draft a bipartisan budget, they know where to find me. https://t.co/bZzlWzPkUjThe 32,000 children in my district who benefit from #CHIP deserve for the program to be permanently extended to avoid partisan bickering in the future. #NJ10@realDonaldTrump You have constituents evacuating their homes because of a potential tsunami, and THIS is your focus? First-responders are out there putting their lives on the line to save people, and THIS is what you’re worried about? #Kodiak #tsunamiwatchMcCarthy: "...Let's commit that we will pass through both Houses every appropriation bill with full funding for our troops, full funding for our defense, and full funding for every service our government owes to its people." 

Yes, let's fully fund gov't services!@GOPLeader McCarthy: "It's not your mistakes that define you, it's what you learn from them. So, let's commit to each other and to the American public that we will not continue to fund our government through these short-term CRs." . . . 1/ https://t.co/hOk2FmK5cSI'll be voting AGAINST the Senate's continuing resolution, which does not address the longstanding bipartisan issues faced by the American People. #TrumpShutdown2018 My statement: https://t.co/eQb7jK4D70@realDonaldTrump No-Deal Donald Trump can’t hold up his end of a bargain. Not good! Meet with Congress leaders to negotiate in good faith to fully fund government, permanently reauthorize #CHIP, #protectDREAMers, fund community health centers, etc. We CAN do it all! #TrumpShutdownThe last time Republicans turned off the lights on the American People,   our nation lost $24 billion in economic output. The #TrumpShutdown will have the same effect if Republicans do not come to the table and work with Dems on bipartisan solutions. #GovtShutdown #WomenMarch2018 https://t.co/TxolAmBLRDLow-energy, no-deal @realDonaldTrump is tired of governing. Well, #Democrats are ready to get the gov’t running if only the GOP would come to the table in good faith to negotiate a budget that funds bipartisan priorities of the American People. #TrumpShutdown #WomensMarch2018 2/2Republicans spent all their time and votes on tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest few. Now, they have no energy to actually govern. They refuse to permanently extend the Children’s Health Insurance Program, #ProtectDREAMers, or pass a budget. 1/Why does the #GOP refuse to govern? Republicans control…
-the White House
-the House of Representatives
-the Senate
The #TrumpShutdown is their fault, and the American people know it. Democrats are ready to negotiate when Republicans approach us in good faith.Because #Republicans refused to negotiate in good faith with #Democrats on a bipartisan spending bill, the United States government ran out of money at 12:01 this morning.  No sane legislator wants to shut down the federal government, but Republicans just did. #shutdown2018 https://t.co/BZymWMDRHK@SenateMajLdr Your false dichotomy is immoral.

We cannot keep moving from one #shutdown crisis to the next. 1/Republicans have got to start working with Democrats to govern. We can’t keep moving from one shutdown crisis to the next.

They are an integral part of our communities. The Diversity Visa Program MUST be protected. #ProtectDiversityVisas https://t.co/9YXLM9fhVl@realDonaldTrump @POTUS The false narrative that the Diversity Visa Program sends over the worst people from African countries is absurd and ignorant. 6/6@realDonaldTrump @POTUS "African immigrants were more than twice as likely as the U.S. population overall to work in healthcare—32,500 nursing psychiatric or health home aides, more than 46,000 registered nurses and more than 15,700 doctors and surgeons.” We need them, and they need us! 5/@realDonaldTrump (Only 38 percent of @POTUS's favored Norwegian immigrants graduated college with a bachelor's degree or higher.) 4/@realDonaldTrump For one thing, immigrants from Africa are exceedingly well-educated. Whereas only 32 percent of the U.S. born population who are 25 and over have a bachelor's degree, 41 percent of Diversity Visa immigrants from Africa have one. 3/@realDonaldTrump The Diversity Visa Program has allowed the best and brightest from Africa and the Caribbean to legally immigrate to America. Of the sub-Saharan immigrants who have become legal permanent residents, 17% came through the DV Program. 2/ https://t.co/aqEEYHfSZ8@realDonaldTrump The United States was built by and on the backs of Africans who were brought to this country against their will, so to suddenly exclude Africans and Afro-Caribbean people from opportunities to immigrate to this country is shameful. 1/Times may seem severe, but, as Dr. King said in 1968, “only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.” Let us go into 2018 living and doing as Dr. King would have us go—with passion and compassion for peace and justice. #MLKDay #MLK https://t.co/6sNSHHT1rm24 Members of Congress are calling on @realDonaldTrump to put money where his mouth is and fund transportation infrastructure — including the huge jobs-creating Gateway Project. https://t.co/lPrYAaNzEaThe President's comment about Haiti and African countries was vile, disgusting, and ignorant. In today's meeting, he laid bare the administration's racist anti-immigration policy.

https://t.co/O8mLo9TUnlThe century-old Portal Bridge got stuck earlier, snarling commutes. THIS is why we need the Gateway Project to be funded and moving forward, @realDonaldTrump! https://t.co/qdBCv27Jig192,000 children will be separated from their parents with the termination of #TPS.

Congress must step in and #SAVETPSSalvadorans make up the largest group of #TPS holders in the country. They're people who

Tune in on CSPAN or https://t.co/VjSxzv0uSQ soon!The 115th Congress is back in session. Will @HouseGOP finally let us vote on a clean #DREAMAct? Why is #Republican leadership so afraid of this bipartisan legislation? #DreamActNowGovernor Brendan Byrne was a good man. No, he was a great man. He was a kind, compassionate, and upstanding leader for the State of New Jersey. He will be missed. My deepest condolences go to his family and friends. https://t.co/UFLjSVQfoW5/5 We should not focus on myths perpetuated by a childish President to advance his anti-democratic agenda.4/ The integrity of our electoral system is essential to democracy. We should focus on making it easier to vote. We should focus on protecting the cyber security of election infrastructure. And we should focus on finding money to replace outdated, insecure voting machines.3/ Study after study has shown that voter fraud is almost non-existent. If it occurs at all, it does not occur with frequency enough to rig elections. A person is more likely to be struck by lightning than a ballot is likely to be fraudulent.@realDonaldTrump 2/ @POTUS’s #VoterFraud commission was a petulant attempt to distract from his loss of the popular vote, and like nearly everything else the President touches, his commission failed.1/ The President’s voter fraud commission was a ridiculous scam from the start. It “went off the rails” because @realDonaldTrump was off the rails to believe that massive voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote. 
https://t.co/NDcEjuyhKE@realDonaldTrump Also, not all #DACA recipients and #DREAMers are Hispanic. They are Latino, Indian, Filipino... But that doesn’t matter to you since you’re really just dog-whistling to your base and to the alt-right. The American People see right through you, Mr. Trump. #DreamActNow@realDonaldTrump Your petulance is never-ending. YOU terminated DACA in an attempt to distract from your failing presidency and rally your crumbling base. #Democrats, on the other hand, want to protect young people and demand that @HouseGOP leaders let Congress vote 👍🏽 or 👎🏽 on the DREAM Act.¡feliz año nuevo! https://t.co/BWMpXtOwwzHappy New Year! https://t.co/ggtBQs5HY0@realDonaldTrump’s attack on the  Gateway Project, a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar railway #infrastructure project in #Amtrak’s NE Corridor, illustrates that #Trump has no interest in rebuilding #America's infrastructure or putting Americans back to work. #MAGA is a sham. https://t.co/OG7XyLJnljThe lives of DREAMers cannot be held hostage by the President’s petulant demand for an overpriced, unnecessary wall.
