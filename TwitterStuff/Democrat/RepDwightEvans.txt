It’s exhausting to hear about the importance of ‘family values’ from Republicans who are willing to cause undue harm to a vast number of Americans with pre-existing conditions. Our most vulnerable — children and seniors — will suffer greatly if the GOP is successful!Per usual, we have learned NOTHING since our last mass shooting. Every Republican in Congress who doesn’t sign common-sense gun reform legislation will be on notice this November!I’m saddened and disheartened to learn about that tragedy that struck the Capital Gazette newspaper. It’s critical Republicans in Congress stand up and FIGHT alongside my Democratic colleagues for common-sense gun reform. #EnoughIsEnoughCongrats Tom and Frances👏🏾 https://t.co/NoqFkKRuh9The Republican tax plan favored the 1%, wealthy corporations, and continues to hurt hard-working Americans trying to get ahead. It’s about time Republicans work on behalf of the American people instead of their wealthy donors!Thanks @GovernorTomWolf  and the PA General Assembly for its bi-partisan efforts to pass this important piece of legislation that will help Pennsylvanians. https://t.co/m6BUPGaGVa1 in 6 Philadelphia residents use #SNAP as their first line of defense against hunger. Snatching the one resource struggling Americans have to feed their loved ones is cruel!There are more than 600,000 Philadelphians with pre-existing conditions. Every time the GOP attempts to sabotage healthcare they put innocent Americans in harm’s way! It’s sickening and we won't forget their inexcusable tactics this November.Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell BLOCKED Judge Garland’s nomination to the SCOTUS in 2016 b/c of the upcoming Presidential election. Well, Mitch, it’s an election year. Seems about fair we follow your own rule &amp; wait until the next Congress to confirm a nominee.It’s incredibly alarming that our news outlets aren’t allowed to report from INSIDE Trump's migrant tents. President Trump is clearly afraid of what Americans would see if given the chance!I no longer want to hear about ‘family values’ from Republicans if they continue to remain silent about the mistreatment of migrant children from @ICEgov!PA’s #CleanSlate is a perfect example of legislation that should be enacted nationwide! Far too many Americans are struggling to find a job simply b/c of their minor criminal records—it’s about time they get a chance at life—one w/o crippling restrictions! https://t.co/SVg3ZcjKz1#SCOTUS dealt a major blow to our middle class who undeniably depend on #unions for fair wages, access to healthcare, and moving communities of color forward. There are more than 150K union members in Philly and today’s announcement puts families at risk—it’s simply unacceptable! https://t.co/RrAayzR6rVFrom his hateful #Muslimban, to his preposterous #healthcare plan, and his inhumane #immigration policy, we can see this President has no value for family nor country!The US is one of the richest countries in the world, but there are hundreds of thousands of people who don't have enough money to put food on the table.

Instead of increasing #SNAP funds, GOP wants to cut America's most successful anti-hunger program--shameful!I’m incredibly disappointed #SCOTUS decided to uphold Pres. Trump’s divisive &amp; discriminatory #MuslimBan. Since Trump stepped foot in our nation’s sacred Oval Office, he has unraveled every fiber of our democracy and contradicted what it truly means to be a leader.According to PayScale, the cost of housing in PHL is 29 percent HIGHER than the national avg. W/ a dismal $7.25 per hr as min wage in our city it’s essentially impossible for residents to have a place of their own--it's critical we address the need of affordable housing for ALL!Struggling Americans rely on SNAP for survival. It’s cruel to take away a major life-line @GOP. Why do you believe in hurting low-income communities? What happened to helping thy neighbor?Republicans blew a giant hole in the deficit--$1.9 TRILLION to be exact--but to stay 'on brand' they are calling for major cuts to life-saving programs, such as #Medicare in their GOP budget.Tune in at 8 PM to catch me on @cspan as I anchor @OfficialCBC’s Special Order Hour about Republicans hypocrisy on family values--this is something you don’t want to miss!Thanks@State Rep Wheatley👍🏽 https://t.co/Ssd9nTp2ZTYesterday, House Republicans snatched food away from MILLIONS of hard-working Americans. It’s immoral to take food out of the mouths from our neediest communities AFTER passing their terrible tax plan that continues to feed the rich. #HandsOffSNAP #ProtectSNAP https://t.co/4adnWNyHwqUnfortunately, the #GOPFarmBill has passed, BUT, it’s up to all of us to make our voices heard and fight for our children, senior citizens, and veterans who depend on #SNAP for stability &amp; survival!Remember: The THOUSANDS of children who were snatched from their parents at the border could be traumatized for LIFE.The heinous actions led by Trump and his goonies are reprehensible.
 
Come November, Americans will remember that our country ripped innocent children away from their mothers and placed them in cages during the Summer of 2018.Republicans feel it is necessary to be fiscally conservative again, after pouring millions of dollars into their donors’ banks and pushing through their #TaxScam. https://t.co/JMKWefLa0ATrump created an inconceivable family separation policy that left migrant kids desperately crying out to be reunited w/ their parents. Now, he wants credit for reversing a crisis he created!

We aren't fooled, we see that your lack of a moral compass continues to harm thousands!Every day, in the city of Philadelphia,  a family mourns the loss of a loved one at the hands of gun violence.
 
It’s time we speak about the gun violence that occurs in black and brown communities--they too are tired of memorials on their corners. #GunReformNowPresident Trump continues to spew blatant lies about HIS Administration’s #FamilySeparation policy. Let the record show, Trump could easily reverse this policy, but he would rather use traumatized migrant children as bargaining chips.I urge my fellow constituents in #Philadelphia and #Montgomery County to continue making their voices heard against President Trump’s abhorrent zero-tolerance policy that separates migrant children from their parents at the border. We cannot stand for this!My Democratic colleagues and I will continue to hold President Trump accountable for every atrocity that occurs at the border wall.

You cannot rinse your hands of this mess, @realDonaldTrump!Republicans, the ‘party of family values’, continue to be undeniably silent toward Trump’s unconscionable family separation policy.

The world will remember the time when Republicans stepped aside and said nothing to our President about his despicable #FamilySeparation policy.This was a great day for PHiladelphia👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 https://t.co/v5df7cUZ8LLast Saturday, I had the pleasure of hosting a Federal Services Fair in Fairmount Park in #Philadelphia to connect residents with programs and services that are available through the federal government.

The 500,000 Philadelphians who depend on #SNAP for nourishment and survival are lucky to have a senator who cares about their health and economic well-being!This week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse and unspeakable gang violence will not qualify for asylum--his actions will unequivocally put thousands of immigrants in harm’s way as they are seeking safety in the United States.In #Pennsylvania, the average resident has to make $19.53 per hour to afford a 2-bedroom apartment.
 
Despite this, President Trump and his Republican friends are doing all that they can to raise rents &amp; cause Americans undue harm! https://t.co/SO0toV9oSRPhilly has the HIGHEST opioid death rate of any major American city—last year, more than 1,200 people from our city lost their lives from an opioid overdose. It’s critical for a GOP-led Congress to enact a long-term funding solution that’ll properly address our opioid epidemic!While our kids are struggling to learn in crumbling school buildings, they are breathing in toxic asbestos fibers, &amp; EPA Admin Pruitt announced that his agency won’t evaluate health risks of asbestos.

This is just 1 of the reasons why we must #BootPruitt. https://t.co/tdycMIkHWZWhile I 👏🏾 @dominos work on fixing America’s beat-up roads—Congress should be fixing our ailing infrastructure!

Rs have made it abundantly clear that they’ll continue to prioritize the need of the 1% instead of the needs of the middle and working class—it’s truly unacceptable!The Trump Administration is hard at work gutting a key provision in the Affordable Care Act: the protection of individuals with pre-existing conditions.

For years, Republicans said people with pre-existing conditions wouldn’t be harmed—that.was.a.lie. https://t.co/OEFA3T3wkCIt’s cruel and inhumane to separate children from their parents who are simply seeking asylum in the United States. Shame on President Trump and his Administration! #EndFamilySeparationPHL student activists are demanding that their fed, local, &amp; state reps enact common-sense gun reform to stop the onslaught of gun violence in their city.

I've held a Criminal Justice Reform Roundtable w/ Congressman Jerrold Nadler (NY-10), spoke alongside Gov. Wolf + rapper Meek Mill about the need for criminal justice reform, met w/ @ProjectHOME about affordable housing.1/4 @keatondnichols, thanks for asking! As you may know, poverty doesn't happen overnight and cities like PHL arrived at an insane 26% poverty rate b/c of the criminal justice system, discriminatory housing practices, deindustrialization, &amp; lack of access to a quality education. https://t.co/rQhyPRhv83Neighborhoods in Philadelphia experience gun violence on a daily basis. Philadelphians deserve to feel safe and walk down the street without fear! #EnoughIsEnoughThe poverty rate in Philly is at a staggering 26% and between the years 2000 and 2014, the city has lost nearly 24,000 affordable housing units.

As elected officials, we must ensure that every American has a roof over their head.

All too often we forget about the Americans who work multiple jobs and still can’t meet their basic needs!The national dialogue on common-sense gun reform MUST include the trauma caused by everyday gun violence.

Far too many communities of color feel that their first-hand experience w/ gun violence and their solutions to fix it are ignored and neglected.President Trump threw paper towels at grief-stricken Puerto Ricans just DAYS after Hurricane Maria struck their island—of course, he isn’t capable of properly addressing the THOUSANDS of Americans who have died on his watch.America’s schools are deteriorating &amp; nothing is being done about. In PHL, the avg age of a school building is 70-yrs-old.

It's entirely unacceptable for our students to be expected to succeed in classrooms that are crumbling right before their very eyes. https://t.co/1H47Eyuxqghttps://t.co/FrwodxdAnOhttps://t.co/nlTx53CgVJhttps://t.co/209W25cBEKhttps://t.co/E2In0ea4BKVoting Matters!!!! https://t.co/bs3Ao259jzhttps://t.co/r56AXaVjXUThank you to Central High School students for stopping by my office and asking my staff &amp; I poignant questions about the criminal justice system and common-sense gun reform.

GOP-led Congress has failed this young woman &amp; 1000s of others. https://t.co/TreRxw2ewJWe can’t “hope and pray” that gun violence will go away—we must take action and enact common-sense gun reform to prevent another tragedy before it’s too late!🦅player, @MalcolmJenkins, kneeled during the national anthem to protest racial injustices across USA while participating in charities to create change.

The notion that NFL players simply kneel w/o taking concrete actions to solve the injustices that they're protesting is absurdPro Tip: Any Member of Congress who takes $$$ from the NRA should stop offering their thoughts &amp; prayers to families who lost their loved ones at the hands of gun violence.

You are part of the problem, not the solution!PHL is just 1 of many cities throughout America that grapples w/ the cost of updating aging school buildings.

That’s why my bill, HR 922, would amend the tax code to allow schools to qualify for a tax credit that will address the crumbling infrastructure. https://t.co/dSS5xmBZbMToo many young people are dying because of the senseless gun violence throughout Philadelphia.

It’s critical we include people like 17-year old Sandrea Williams, who died nearly two weeks ago in West Philly, as we demand #GunReformNow! Enough is enough!President Trump's tweets do not put food on the kitchen table, increase wages, make housing more affordable, or decrease the gun violence in Philadelphia.

Instead, his tweets highlight his lack of understanding about the current struggles millions of Americans face.The # of thoughts &amp; prayers Republicans have offered in the wake of tragic gun violence far succeeds the # of times they have joined my Dem colleagues and me on legislation to enact common-sense #gunreform.

The time for action is NOW—myself &amp; thousands of others have had enough!I strongly encourage Republicans to work alongside my Democratic colleagues and me to create a CLEAN #FarmBill. Let’s prove to the American people that it’s possible for Congress to work together!Republicans in Congress work harder at the expense of poor people, than when it comes to fighting for common-sense #GunReform which effects everybody.

Once again, their silence and inaction is deafening.According to @phillydotcom, there are more than 700,000 people in the PHL area who are food insecure. In Philly alone, 1 in 6 residents are food insecure &amp; look to #SNAP to put food on the kitchen table. Demand the GOP to keep their #HandsOffSNAP!I voted against the #GOPFarmBill because it would leave 70,000 Pennsylvania households to lose #SNAP eligibility and Philly residents have too much to lose under a GOP-leadership.
 
I’ll continue to vote NO on the #FarmBill if it includes ANY cuts to #SNAP!(May 4th) Pres. Trump at NRA Convention: *Our human rights are under siege…but they’ll never be under siege as long as I’m your President*
 
(May 18th) Pres. Trump: *We send our support for those at #SantaFe HS in TX*
 
We need elected officials that fight on behalf of our kids!Childhood hunger in North Philly has TRIPLED among families who’ve worked more than 20 hours a week.

The idea that those on #SNAP don’t work is a bold-faced lie Republicans continue to spew without FACTS.In Philadelphia, there are residents who are simply trying to survive everyday gun violence AND put food on the kitchen table. 
 
If the GOP really wants to move America forward, they should INCREASE #SNAP $$ and PASS #GunReformNow!When a family loses their loved one at the hands of gun violence, we must do more than offer condolences. We must stand beside them to fight the NRA and the politicians who don’t support common-sense gun reform!https://t.co/k8YrgAwTIVDemand action from your Representatives! Remember, come November, if they continue to sit on their hands and remain silent about common-sense gun reform: Vote. Them. Out.Because of YOU, the Republican #FarmBill FAILED to pass the House. While we celebrate this win, we must stay engaged and hold Republicans accountable for attempting to cut #SNAP and rip food away from millions of Americans.When President Trump spoke at the NRA convention a few weeks ago, NO guns were allowed in the building—yet, our President wants teachers to carry weapons to protect students. An extremely problematic idea, most Americans don’t agree with.Yet again another community is shaken by grief &amp; tragedy after Santa Fe HS shooting in TX. The constant inaction from @GOP lead Congress is unacceptable. We need to come together to stand up to the #NRA and demand action. Our future depends on it. #EnoughIsEnoughAt this very moment, the Republican party is doing everything in their power to push through their awful #FarmBill that will throw 2 MILLION poor Americans off #SNAP, our best anti-hunger program in the country.

Dial 202-224-3121 and tell your MoC to vote NO on the #GOPFarmBill!The GOP #FarmBill will cause 70,000 #Pennsylvania households to lose #SNAP eligibility. This is unacceptable and I’ll make sure my voice is heard loud and clear about why this partisan Farm Bill will cause undue harm to our communities!Republicans are doing all that they can to cram their shameful #FarmBill through Congress.

I urge everyone in Philadelphia and around the country to call their Representative at 202-224-3121 and DEMAND they stand up for those in poverty who rely on #SNAP!In 2016, candidate Donald J. Trump asked African-Americans, “What the HELL do you have to lose?”

Under his leadership and a Republican-led Congress, poor African-Americans will lose their only access affordable, quality food (#SNAP) and healthcare for their children (#CHIP).There are Members of Congress who  once used the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, #SNAP, when their families fell on hard times.

Now, in 2018, Republicans want to make it harder for poor Americans to get food assistance they need. This is immoral!64% of #SNAP recipients are children, elderly, &amp; people w/ disabilities.

$20 BILLION in cuts will cause a massive ripple effect in our neighborhoods.

The Republican Party is in the business of making Americans struggle and live in anguish. It's cruel and inhumane.With a depressing $7.25/hour for minimum wage and high housing costs, Philadelphians are in dire need of affordable housing. It is critical that Congress addresses America’s affordable housing crisis—everyone should have a safe place to live!Our most vulnerable citizens—children, the elderly, and people w/ disability—are at the greatest risk if the #GOPFarmBill passes the House and Senate!

Like and RT to urge @SpeakerRyan, #HandsOffSNAP!The #GOPFarmBill could force 2 MILLION Americans off #SNAP, which is the most successful anti-hunger program in our country. We can’t allow this to happen! Make your voice heard loud and clear for the @GOP to keep their #HandsOffSNAP!Nationwide, hard-working Americans are finding it extremely difficult to secure affordable housing. In Philly, the struggle to find reasonably priced housing is no different. It’s essential for Congress to look at models that work b/c bold solutions are needed to fix this issue!Let’s not forget that a Republican-led Congress is trying to cut $7 billion from #CHIP, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, that 176,000 sick Pennsylvanians rely on.

We must make our voices heard to stop this senseless act in Congress!I'm are sick &amp; tired of the gun violence that plagues our city. I'm sick &amp; tired of the condolences from Republicans that don’t include gun reform.

Come November, we'll remember if you stood up to the NRA or crumbled under their pressure. https://t.co/gHH4vU4O47https://t.co/ZzCKNS9sPJ#GOPTaxScam ballooned the national deficit to $1 Trillion. Now Rs are covering up their failed attempt at Tax Reform by✂️$20 BILLION from #SNAP, an anti-hunger program that feeds 42 MIL.

@GOP--everyone sees your thinly veiled attack on working poor for what it is: Disgraceful!Yesterday, my dear colleague &amp; friend, @RepMcGovern said, “when I was growing up it was school bullies that went after kids’ lunch money, it wasn’t the US Congress.”

And, he's absolutely right! It's cruel + utterly shameful for GOP to go after children who are living in poverty.ANY cuts to #SNAP - America's best anti-hunger program - will only drive more citizens into poverty, and the blame must fall squarely on Republicans. They’ve made it impossible for my Democratic colleagues and I to collaborate w/ them on the #2018FarmBill.Searching for a job?  Happening tomorrow in the 2nd Congressional District. https://t.co/DrEzNPJI1fAlways great to worship at African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas St. Thomas celebrates Women's Day with Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie https://t.co/6xO1KDmcsnA staggering 400,000 Philadelphians live in poverty and each and every day they are concerned about making ends meet.

We must raise the minimum wage to a LIVABLE amount so Americans can support their families!Republicans in the House and Senate are making backroom deals to push their 2018 #FarmBill into law. This bill will snatch food from the mouths of the most vulnerable seniors and children.

Call your Rep today to demand:  #HandsOffSNAP!More than 9 million children &amp; their mothers rely on #CHIP for quality, affordable #healthcare. It is abhorrent for Republicans to cut this life-saving program, cause undue harm to communities nationwide, &amp; pull the rug right from under the feet of our most vulnerable neighbors!It’s #InfrastructureWeek (again) and President Trump and a Republican-led Congress have yet to keep their promises to the American people. Roads, bridges, and school buildings are still crumbling. It’s #TimeToBuild once and for all!Republicans are trying to push a message that #CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) costs the American taxpayer too much money. Interesting, b/c the #GOPTaxscam gave $1.4 TRILLION to corporations and their wealthy donors. Once again, the GOP put the 1% before sick children.The min wage in Philadelphia is a dismal $7.25/hour, while the avg rent in our city is $1,423. To pay for rent, residents must work 50 hrs/week. That doesn’t include the cost of food, medicine, &amp; other necessities.

We NEED a livable wage!Four: Two-thirds of #SNAP recipients are children, elderly, and people w/ disabilities. 

Five:  “You want everyone to reach their full potential” w/ less food in their stomachs?

Six: Your party’s agenda is riddled w/ policies that move America backwards, not forward.There are so many problems w/ this tweet. 

One: There are 6.6 mill jobs available for SKILLED workers. 

Two: The #2018FarmBill will, in fact, push more Americans into poverty.

Three: work. requirements. don't. work.

(there's more) https://t.co/zHVDMQMtkLThe Republican Party is on the verge of passing a #FarmBill which includes work requirements and major cuts to SNAP.

CC: @GOPAny MoC who votes in favor of cutting $7 BILLION from Children’s Health Insurance Program (#CHIP) doesn’t deserve to represent their district anymore. It’s heartless to cut billions of dollars from a program that sick children depend on, &amp; yet continue to throw money at the 1%.W. Philly has the highest poverty rate across our city. This is the result of awful policies that have inflicted pain on our communities for decades! I’m urging @SpeakerRyan to read #JobsAndJustice b/c our communities deserve better!There are 400,000 Philadelphians who live in poverty. They want a stable job w/ a livable wage, affordable housing, #healthcare, and a great school for their children. They want a Congress that can work together to help them move forward. Enough bickering, we need solutions!Still waiting for President Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner to provide solutions to our criminal justice system. I strongly suggest they read @OfficialCBC’s #JobsAndJustice Act for policy solutions that properly address decades of harmful justice policies.According to @ProjectHOME, in 2016, there were about 15,000 people in homeless shelters in Philadelphia, and more than 6,500 indivs living on the streets, in cars, &amp; in abandoned buildings. It’s imperative that we address the need for affordable housing in our city!.@SpeakerRyan, nearly 9,000 low-income children and their mothers in my district receive healthcare through #CHIP. ANY cuts to this essential, life-saving program will cause undue harm to our communities. #BeBest and leave CHIP alone!The Republican agenda is riddled w/ policies that are meant to harm our most vulnerable group of people.

For ex., GOP is looking to cut $7B from the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a program 9M poor children depend on. It’s simply cruel to do this to sick, poor kids!My bill would amend the tax code to allow school buildings to qualify for a tax credit that’s aimed at fixing their aging #infrastructure. 

As your MOC, please understand I’m doing all that I can to address this issue because the safety of our children is crucially important!#DYK the avg age of a PHL school is 70yrs old? @phillydotcom reported that these schools are riddled w/ dangerous amounts of asbestos which can cause our students to become extremely sick.

Serious missteps by Trump and his Administration have left our fellow Americans in extreme hardship.It is the agenda of Trump and a Republican-led Congress to make the lives of poor, hard-working Americans more difficult. Instead of lifting people out of poverty, the reality is, our President and GOP Congress continuously bully our most vulnerable neighbors.Republicans would rather put money in the pockets of the 1% than support legislation like the #JobsAndJustice Act, which will foster economic growth and address the need for #justicereform. https://t.co/kZlitrAFLMDuring the campaign trail, candidate Trump asked an African-American crowd in Philadelphia, “What the HELL do you have to lose?” Since Trump came into office he has proposed dangerous and immoral cuts to social safety programs such as #SNAP and #CHIP. #WeHaveALotToLoseRapper @MeekMill was supposed to spend up to FOUR YEARS in jail for violating his probation. Four years for a minor violation. He’s a perfect example of how the justice system FAILS those who should be rehabilitated, not thrown into jail.Rs ballooned deficit to $1.4 Trillion b/c of their tax cuts for the 1%. NOW, Pres.

The political games they’re playing are at the expense of sick kids and it’s unacceptable &amp; uncalled for!Under #GOPTaxScam, tax cuts were given to wealthy donors. Rs turned their back on American people and put $$ in the pockets of the rich. The tax cuts they gave to the 1% could’ve EASILY provided funding to #SNAP. Instead, they continue to put low-income communities in harm’s way!#DidYouKnow, SNAP gives recipients only $1.40 a meal? That’s it—nothing else! House &amp; Senate Republicans want to snatch the little food senior citizens and children have because of this nutrition assistance program. We should be INCREASING funding to #SNAP, not cutting it!Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out the of Iran Nuclear Deal will inevitably bring us to the brink of war. Those in Philly are already incredibly concerned about job security, healthcare, &amp; safety of their loved ones. Trump’s actions yesterday are a serious lapse in judgement!In PHL there’s a staggering 26% poverty rate &amp; 1 in 6 residents go hungry on an everyday-basis. 1000s of residents in my district rely on SNAP for stability &amp; survival. Yet, GOP continue their thinly-veiled attacks on social safety net programs like #SNAP. RT to say #HandsOffSNAPFor #TeacherAppreciationWeek, I want to give a big shout-out to my favorite teacher, the late Ms. Fannie Burrows, who taught me in 5th grade at Robert Fulton Elem School. Thank you, Ms. Burrows, for instilling confidence in me and making learning fun!!My bill amends the Small Business Act to provide a variety of services that include grants, financial assistance, loans, and other critical services to our #smallbiz. (2/2)As a proud member of the @HouseSBCDems, I’m excited to announce that my bill, HR 1702, the Small #Business Development Centers (SBDC) Improvement Act of 2017, which I introduced, passed the House Floor w/ bipartisan support! (1/2) https://t.co/gggkACgcWHNationwide, teachers are raising their voices loud and clear and demanding that they deserve to earn a living wage. No teacher should have to work multiple jobs to put food on the table for their families! #TeacherAppreciationWeekDuring #TeacherAppreciationWeek, I urge everyone to #ThankATeacher in #Philadelphia for the impactful work they do in the classroom. They don’t get enough credit for the work they do that helps shapes the lives of thousands of students. (2/2)THREAD: On a daily basis, PHL teachers work with students who suffer unbelievable trauma from exposure to violence, hunger, and poverty. Everyday, our teachers navigate this trauma to best support our students. (1/2)There are 176,000 children in PA who rely on Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for stability + survival. Cuts to #CHIP will cause undue harm to our communities and that's why I'm fighting Trump &amp; his cruel policies b/c too many lives are at stake! https://t.co/P4FEzR3mT2U are right! #ProtectSNAP https://t.co/RSzJF3XBSPThe Neubauers are Making Ideas Matter. The Neubauers want to fix Philly schools. Their plan? To sharpen the principal force. https://t.co/dVR0TzVTv2 via @phillydotcomMy bill would use our tax code to allow school buildings to qualify for a tax credit in order to fix our crumbling #school bldgs. I believe we have an obligation to build a stronger tomorrow for all of the #students in our city! https://t.co/B9h36xysx2One of the top things that make families want to lay their roots in a neighborhood is quality schools. That's why the 1st bill I introduced in #Congress was HR 922, the Rehabilitation of Historic Schools Act of 2017.I thank you for being good citizens👍🏽 https://t.co/4Fh1yj143ETY @MeekMill for speaking out about the need for Criminal #JusticeReform in PA. As a life-long resident of #Philadelphia, the criminal justice system has impacted families for generations and enough is enough! As your MoC, I'm working hard to move Philly forward! https://t.co/tED39e21COIndivs are being thrown into jail b/c their possession of marijuana. That’s why I co-sponsored @TulsiGabbard &amp; @RepTomGarrett bill, HR 1227—the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017. This bill would eliminate fed criminal penalties for possessing &amp; growing marijuana!In #Philly, African-Americans are more likely to be arrested than any other racial group. The time is NOW to address the problems in our Criminal Justice System that’s predominately affecting our black and brown communities.That’s why as your representatives in Congress, we are hard at work to ensure the protection of #SNAP, a critical nutrition assistance program, and fight back against Republicans who’ve pushed through a Farm Bill that will cause more undue harm to our communities!As members of the House &amp; Senate Agriculture Committee, we’ve had countless meetings across #Philadelphia and #Pennsylvania to gauge the wants and needs of our constituents. We are incredibly aware of what #PA has to lose under this shameful #2018FarmBill.
