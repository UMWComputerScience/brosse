Every single day something horrific like this happens.

Thanks to @RepTomReed, @RepBuddyCarter &amp; the additional 279 bipartisan House Members who have cosponsored this important bill.Every person deserves the truth when it comes to their health care.

Since he won’t do anything, Congress must act &amp; pass my Central America Family Protection &amp; Reunification Act ASAP. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAG Jeff Sessions &amp; @POTUS cruelly disregard asylum claims related to domestic violence. My legislation rejects this absurdity &amp; brings attention to root causes of migration from Central America. #KeepFamiliesTogetherI introduced Central America Family Protection &amp; Reunification Act w/@RepEspaillat &amp; @NormaJTorres today rejecting heartless #Trump family separation policy &amp; requiring US embassies in CentAm to play robust role in reuniting children with their families #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/28AWfWAJJXA smart, thoughtful, and compassionate Admin. would have ended this policy with a clear plan to reunify children already separated from their families. 
Then again, a smart, thoughtful, and compassionate Admin. would never institute such a cruel policy in the first place. https://t.co/qN3NKJD8XZWhat about the children who have already been separated from their families? How will they be reunited?

What about the families moving forward? They’re going to be jailed, children included?

What about @SecNielsen who lied to the American people? How does she keep her job? https://t.co/o509FMIpnYOh, I thought @POTUS didn’t have the authority to fix this terrible problem which he himself created? Guess that was just #FakeNews. https://t.co/D9yUCxrs9rFamily separation is inhumane and the Administration is not being transparent about the conditions in the child detention centers. My @EnergyCommerce colleagues and I are demanding an immediate hearing to get answers. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/Eb6WvC4wA5.@HouseDemocrats won’t stand by as families are ripped apart by the Trump Administration’s heartless policies. Today I joined @RepJerryNadler and 109 of my colleagues to cosponsor the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct.While the Trump Administration takes children from their families, @HouseGOP is working to take health care from Americans. Today, @HouseGOP proposed a budget that would cut #Medicare and #Medicaid and repeal the #ACA. Unconscionable. https://t.co/2YIDJpNshEIt isn’t enough for @SecNielsen to rip families apart. She also has to lie about doing it, lie about Congress’ role in it, and lie about the President’s ability to end it with one phone call. She needs to resign. #FamiliesBelongTogether.Hey @SecNielsen: there is NO law requiring the separation of families. This is a crisis entirely manufactured by the Trump Administration and it is despicable. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/cDYyJ19xe1This #FathersDay let’s not forget about the dads, and moms, who are living through the hell of being separated from their children due to this Administration’s cruel policies.

Americans demand #ABetterDeal. Today, President Trump failed to offer one.In Oct., when @EnergyCommerce Dems &amp; I voted in favor of letting #Medicare negotiate lower drug prices—which the President once claimed to support—@HouseGOP members voted it down. That idea was absent from President Trump’s speech today. Another in a long list of broken promisesRising drug prices are a key concern for millions of American families. Today, President Trump had an opportunity to champion meaningful, comprehensive action for consumers struggling with the rising costs of prescription drugs – &amp; he failed. My statement: https://t.co/QhmNc4Z7leThere’s a reason leaders like @AmerAcadPeds &amp; @MarchofDimes oppose the Trump Administration’s proposed #CHIP cuts: they put America’s children at risk https://t.co/ZWoWHsY76USOON: I’ll join Leader @NancyPelosi and other colleagues to discuss the #IranDeal.Today, @HouseDemocrats and I voted to consider an ambitious plan to address the high cost of prescription drugs. But instead of fighting Rx drug pricing, @HouseGOP is working to kick millions off of health care. Americans demand #ABetterDeal.New developments in the fight for a free and open internet – Senate vote now expected next week. I support the same #NetNeutrality legislation in the House that will #SaveTheInternet.Scrapping the #IranDeal undermines the leverage we have to address Iran’s ballistic missiles, support for terrorism, and human-rights abuses. President Trump just set us back on those critical goals.President Trump alone bears the responsibility for the consequences of the dangerous decision to pull the plug on the #IranDeal.The President’s decision to walk away from #IranDeal makes it easier for Iran to get a bomb &amp; undermines American credibility on the world stage. #Trump created this crisis.As a former teacher and guidance counselor,  I’m proud to cosponsor the @RepOHalleran resolution supporting increased teacher pay and public education funding. The only way to improve our education system is to strongly support our educators. #TeacherAppreciationDay https://t.co/L5kAHBjDU3The Trump Administration proposal to cut #CHIP, a lifeline for so many kids, is just the latest GOP attempt to take away American families’ health care while giving tax breaks to the 1% https://t.co/D5u7g2qzMcThe allegations made yesterday against the now former AG were dark and deeply troubling. Violence against women cannot be tolerated in any corner of our society, period.

Here we are at the South Riverdale Little League opening in the #Bronx. https://t.co/OH2PzJXKXmTo end the opioid epidemic, we must protect #Medicaid &amp; expand states’ capacity to combat this crisis – while taking care not to hamstring that capacity in any way. Watch my remarks during today’s @EnergyCommerce hearing: https://t.co/VsfJQSEgo5I’m voting no on @HouseGOP's sham “balanced budget amendment.” Here’s why: https://t.co/E7siPU26W0See my questions to Mark #Zuckerberg from this morning's Energy and Commerce Committee hearing. #zuckerberghearings https://t.co/G5WkXJg35UWe need to know if foreign or domestic terrorist organizations, hate groups, criminal networks or other extremist networks have obtained #Facebook user data. Watch me question Mark #Zuckerberg at @EnergyCommerce: https://t.co/CCU2CKRyVJFrom a white supremacist rally in #Charlottesville to ethnic cleansing in #Burma, we’ve seen the scale &amp; reach of extremism balloon, thanks in large part to platforms like #Facebook. I want to know what Mark #Zuckerberg is doing about it. Watch: https://t.co/CCU2CKRyVJI asked Mark #Zuckerberg how #Facebook will combat foreign influence in our elections going forward. Watch this important @EnergyCommerce hearing here https://t.co/CCU2CKRyVJDid you know that only one House Republican has cosponsored the #PaycheckFairnessAct? There is absolutely no reason why any Member of Congress should oppose equal pay for equal work #EqualPayDayDid you know the pay gap grows even wider for women of color? Black women’s #EqualPayDay won’t come until Aug 7 &amp; Latinas’ #EqualPayDay falls on Nov 1, meaning they must work nearly an extra year to match men’s earnings. Enough.#EqualPayDay falls on Apr. 10 this year, the 100th day of 2018, symbolizing the 100 extra days the average American woman had to work just to earn what men did in 2017. It’s time to pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct &amp; close the pay gap once &amp; for allI had the privilege of visiting @Burke_Rehab with the @alzassociation &amp; @NitaLowey last week to talk about pioneering research happening in #Westchester &amp; my efforts to improve patient care through #PCHETA.

W/@GeorgeLatimer37 https://t.co/6G6HMaf5tPProud to join @AGSchneiderman and so many NY colleagues today in standing against this Administration's move to suppress #Census turnout with citizenship questions. We are committed to working together to ensure #NewYork is not disproportionately hurt by this wrongheaded decision https://t.co/9NAiF6PEKEThis is truly disturbing. Just another reason why @TheJusticeDept needs to do a thorough antitrust review the #Sinclair/Tribune merger. The idea that more homes could soon be subjected to this type of Orwellian media is alarming. #SinclairPropaganda https://t.co/xTQyzvfTbSPeople with an autism spectrum disorder too often face stigma and discrimination. This #WorldAutismAwarenessDay, let’s commit to creating a more supportive world. #LightItUpBlueI’d like wish a very #HappyEaster to all those celebrating today!From my family to yours, we'd like to wish everyone celebrating tonight a very happy and joyous #Passover! Chag Sameach!Couldn't agree more, which is why I'm a cosponsor of #HR676, the Expanded &amp; Improved Medicare For All Act, and have been for years. I believe health care is a right, not a privilege that should be reserved for the wealthy. #MedicareForAll #SinglePayerHealthcare https://t.co/l6kVta7iJWAnother bad decision coming from the @EPA under @EPAScottPruitt—this time on fuel economy standards for automobiles. When it comes to reducing carbon emissions and fighting #climatechange, the United States should be leading, not ceding. https://t.co/fbB6fP0qsNAsking about citizenship on the 2020 #Census will only suppress participation and hurt states like #NewYork. We need to prevent that from happening by passing #HR5359 the #2020Census #IDEA Act. I'm proud to cosponsor this bill. https://t.co/8GSz07pqkk“More action is needed to turn the tide on the #OpioidCrisis, which is why I have co-authored these two bipartisan bills,” Engel said.  https://t.co/pkeplaUokg#NY16 residents: Don’t forget to sign up for my e-newsletter for updates regarding what I’m working on in Washington and the community.

Share the risk test for @AmDiabetesAssn #DiabetesAlertDay: https://t.co/JvzAfBTWQDThe #Census determines how federal funds are allocated. The Trump administration's attempt to suppress participation in the 2020 Census will harm Americans, hurt New York, and undermine our democracy. https://t.co/s2Qe03vgRAI absolutely support lifting the @CDCgov ban on studying #GunViolence. I already cosponsor legislation (#HR1832) which allocates the necessary funds for its study. Gun violence is a public health issue and should be treated as such. https://t.co/Ie0AgPpOKqInfringing on women's constitutional rights isn't just wrong - it's dangerous. That's why I am a cosponsor of the #EACHWomanAct. We must #stopthebans https://t.co/Y5rEUsuw7DI met so many amazing people today in #Parkland from all over the country. Their words and actions were inspiring. Gun violence affects us all, whether directly or indirectly, and its long past time we as nation came together to end this terrible epidemic. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/FqK1UvQhEkIn #Parkland, Florida today for #MarchForOurLives. Standing shoulder to shoulder with these brave advocates who are saying #EnoughIsEnough and #NeverAgain. A grateful nation thanks you for making your voices heard. https://t.co/PDtzTOyswAAll the students from #Westchester, the #Bronx, and across our great country who are participating in today's #MarchForOurLives deserve our thanks for their courage, passion, and voice. Read my letter to them in today's @NYDailyNews https://t.co/n4lTTB2479.@POTUS is doubling down on the same failed #TransBan he announced last summer. Numerous courts have already prohibited this ban from being enforced. It's bad for the military, bad for our country, and devastating for #transgender servicemembers. https://t.co/ODxe3cDMyzToday's #omnibusbill failed to help #DREAMers, failed to address our gun violence epidemic, and contained provisions that jeopardize Americans' privacy and threaten human rights. Our Democratic negotiators worked hard, but this bill still had too many shortcomings and I voted NO.@CecileRichards has led so many fights on behalf of @PPFA, women, and all Americans who need comprehensive health care. Thank you for your leadership, and know I will continue to proudly #standwithPP. @PPact @PPHP @PPHPActivist https://t.co/LauGV6mlf6We cannot allow the #Trump Administration to turn @BBGgov into a #propaganda machine. via @TPM https://t.co/EAKJSU0VbfIt’s been six months since #HurricaneMaria hit #PuertoRico. Thousands are still without power, permanent shelter, or water. The #GOP in Congress and the Administration must do more to help PR rebuild. #6MonthsAfterMaria https://t.co/QPSIxco9ehThinking of the students, faculty and first responders after yet another school shooting, this time at Great Mills High School in Maryland. Inaction from Republican leadership is shameful. Congress MUST do more to prevent this.#Medicaid and the protections guaranteed by the #ACA have helped Americans grappling with substance use disorders get the treatment they need. If the Trump Administration is serious about ending the opioid epidemic, its attacks on these lifelines must end https://t.co/CliXJZWWDfThe #MuellerInvestigation must be protected at all costs. It’s time for the @HouseGOP to get serious, put country before party, and pass #HR3654, the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act. We have 121 cosponsors on this bill, all @HouseDemocrats.Congratulations to all the honorees at tonight’s Beth El 64th Annual Gala in #NewRochelle! https://t.co/HuKWe6bNCoBeautiful day for the 7th annual #SoundShore #StPatricksDay Parade!
