After 4 days in custody, he was separated from his son &amp; moved 1,000 miles away. In what world is this ok? https://t.co/oBDyUWlW8VForced family separation is happening in many places.  Once separated, parents are sent to ICE detention centers &amp; children are sent to shelters designated for unaccompanied children. Parents are often unable to find their children and vice versa. https://t.co/xt9sbLphEj https://t.co/fXmTcUamjkThe @AmAcadPeds opposed @DHSgov’s proposal that would separate mothers from their children arriving at the border saying that in “any time of anxiety and stress, children need to be with their parents, family members and caregivers.” https://t.co/EvUBGzOBPOSeparating children from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane &amp; cruel. Seeking asylum is not illegal, in fact, it is written into US immigration laws to ensure that those w/a credible fear of persecution can present their case.#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/79x2RNjT4WFamily unity is recognized as a fundamental human right, enshrined in international law. The #TrumpAdministration’s proposal and subsequent actions to separate immigrant families flies in the face of this norm. It must stop. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Pf0J8dkH4v.@DHSgov denied that they were breaking the sacred bond between parents and children until the @NYT reported that more than 700 children have been separated from their moms &amp; dads since October. https://t.co/hy5eO44Lug#FamiliesBelongTogether  &amp; the practice of punishing parents who are trying to save their children’s lives, and punishing children for being brought to safety by their parents by separating them is fundamentally cruel and un-American. https://t.co/Pb6kglKJSjDenny contributed so much to our community and we will miss our dear friend greatly.

We need to #endfamilyseparation that harms our families, communities, economy &amp; country. #ProtectFamiliesFACT: The #wagegap between mothers and non-mothers is greater than between women and men. #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/4PpTG93hSOMoms overall who work full-time, year round are only paid 71¢ for every $1 paid to dads. But for moms of color the gap is even worse. The #PaycheckFairnessAct would help bridge the wage gap for all moms. Let’s fight for #MomsEqualPay! https://t.co/rH1f15T1A9Congress has failed to pass commonsense legislation to close the loopholes, expand background checks, and improve the safety of our communities by making it more difficult for deadly weapons to fall into the wrong hands. #GunReformNow  https://t.co/9iVqaeYbgWDenny was my dear friend and mentor and I will miss him greatly. https://t.co/tkiLKcUbD8#EverydayRacism is a disease that affects each of us and we must continue to stand against it.
