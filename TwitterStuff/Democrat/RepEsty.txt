Journalists should not have to worry about being shot in their newsroom any more than children should have to worry about being shot in their classroom.  All lives are precious. The madness must stop.Harmful rhetoric that encourages violence against reporters, like those at the Capital Gazette and at papers across the country, must be condemned swiftly and harshly.If it turns out that the shooter chose his victims because they were reporters, that would raise additional concerns. Make no mistake - an attack on our free press is an attack on our democracy.The reporters at the Capital Gazette and their families deserve our compassion, but also deserve Congressional action to reduce gun violence.More families who will be grieving the loss of a loved one who will not be returning home tonight While there is still much we do not know about what happened today in Annapolis and why, what we do know is this: these shootings must stop.The news out of Annapolis is heartbreaking and horrifying. It is incredibly distressing that, yet again, senseless gun violence has claimed more innocent American lives. https://t.co/OotwX2nQEmAmerica, 2018: https://t.co/Ahp6AQkVTnGreat tips from @GovMalloyOffice about how to stay cool and safe during this upcoming heat wave. Those who are looking for a place to get out of the heat can locate a cooling center, which are available in towns and cities across the state, by calling 2-1-1. https://t.co/TUOXR0NW15It's time we honor our pledge to care for all our veterans exposed to Agent Orange and other toxic substances while in service, and with the House passage of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, we are following through on that commitment. https://t.co/1cP3kMeL2dI call upon all of my colleagues — Democrats and Republicans — to put politics aside and work together to pass legislation to undo this anti-Muslim immigration ban.Ever since the President issued his first travel ban last January, I have been in touch with colleagues, constituents, and community leaders, and I stand ready to provide assistance to any Connecticut family who is endangered by these executive orders.This ban has had the effect of keeping students from their studies, scientists from their labs, and parents from their kids. It will not make America safer. In fact, by excluding immigrants based principally on religion endangers our security.Today’s decision will be a stain on our nation's history. But history will also remember which of our political leaders stood up for our American values — and which were willing to judge people based on their faith and country of origin.It deliberately targets people of a single faith, Islam, for discrimination and hostility. It reinforces Islamophobic sentiments at a time when religious communities throughout the country are being targeted by violence.Incredibly disappointed with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the President’s ban on immigration from predominantly Muslim countries. This ban is immoral, inhumane, and fundamentally un-American. https://t.co/5HXMGIuKS2Taking a moment to wish my LGBTQIA+ friends and family a happy National Pride Month! #LGBTEquality https://t.co/kVKf2FixxAI keep replaying the conversations I had with parents in Texas over &amp; over again in my head, hearing the desperation in their voices as they tried to figure out how to see their children. No family should ever be subjected to such mental torment. #KeepFamiliesTogetherIt’s all beyond heartbreaking.I spoke extensively with one woman whose 12 year old son, her only child, was separated from her within 2 hours of being detained. She doesn’t know where he is. She has no other family--no other children.  No parents of her own. Lots of tears and fear.They are not allowed to make phone calls unless they have money on a credit account, which many don’t.  ICE claims that they can/ will find their children if the women ask. The women say they ask every day.The rest don’t know where their children are. Some have been at the facility for a week and some as long as six weeks. All were in tears. Asking for help to find their children.Only one had spoken with her child (a seven year-old now in New York with family). The children are as young as five.This is the Port Isabel Detention Facility, where we met with 15 recently detained women, all of whom had their children separated from them. https://t.co/ObNHUkQaBoExtensive flooding over the last week has made the situation here even worse. https://t.co/YKwTfOHOqLI will continue to post pictures and updates from our trip when permissible. So far we were not allowed to take pictures inside either the intake facility or the processing facilities.The view from the detention facility bus as we’re on our way to the Port Isabel Detention Facility. https://t.co/TLofPSCfzdArrived safely in Texas last night and starting the day at the McAllen Border Control Station. https://t.co/A4Zym7FbjiThis change starts with the leaders of an organization being accountable for their own words and actions and setting the right example for their employees.In fact, many of these employees are veterans themselves. We owe it to our veterans and VA employees to change a workplace cultures that allow for bad behavior to continue. https://t.co/z3uTb8QLFyThe VA employs over 370,000 people across the country whose primary goal is to assist our veterans who have dutifully and honorably served the United States.I stand by my original statement, which can be found here: https://t.co/W2u6FlIvAIWe needed balanced reforms that would have benefited CT farmers, consumers, &amp; tax-payers without gutting vital anti-hunger efforts.It pains me that in order to assist our hardworking farmers, who make a critical contribution to our economy, it had to come at the expense of some of the most vulnerable people in our state.In fact, over 56,000 hardworking people in Connecticut are eligible for and participate in food assistance programs.  And across the country, 265,000 kids will lose access to free school meals.SNAP is critical to preventing hunger and combating poverty in CT and across the country, particularly for families with children and disabled veterans.The #GOPFarmBill was not acceptable for Connecticut families when we voted on it on 5/18 and it was not acceptable today. https://t.co/JC10eRqUOKThat’s why tomorrow, I will be heading to Texas to see first-hand what is happening and report back to my colleagues about the necessary steps Congress should take to fix this humanitarian crisis.As more stories come to light about the treatment of families along our nation’s border, it is apparent now more than ever that we must hold this Administration accountable for its inhumane policies against people w/out documentation. https://t.co/TeETLZ0aoWI'm committed to working across the aisle w/ my colleagues in Congress to reach broader consensus on the full range of immigration issues including DACA, high skill visas, &amp; agricultural visas. We must reach a bipartisan consensus that fully acknowledges &amp; addresses these issues.The immigration bills that House Republicans are calling for votes tomorrow do nothing to resolve the appalling situation at the border and fail to fix our broken immigration system.Simply put, detention centers are no place for children, with or without their parents.What’s more, this runs against a decades-old court-ordered prohibition against holding children in custody long term.According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, keeping children locked up can cause them negative physical and emotional harm, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.This Executive Order still fails to address the fact that keeping children in detention has the potential to do real and permanent harm to vulnerable children. https://t.co/pXLUScIZnuToday, let us honor these refugees' strength and perseverance and amplify their stories of resilience. Let us celebrate their contributions to our communities, who through their shared talents, skills, cultures, and customs, inspire our country to be one of action and integrity.Our country was built on the shared value and commitment that all humans—regardless of where they were born in the world—deserve an opportunity to pursue an education without interruption, to learn and grow as individuals, and to fulfill their dreams.Many of these families have fled violence and threats and are seeking a safe life for themselves in the United States and elsewhere.According to a recent UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report, there were 68.5 million forcibly displaced people in the world, including 25.4 million refugees. That's 2.9 million more refugees than the year before.Today, on #WorldRefugeeDay, it is important we remember the moral obligation we have as a country to assist those who have been displaced due to factors out of their control. https://t.co/dH7Zec0abuThank you for all your hard work and advocacy on such an important cause! #EndALZ https://t.co/kbN32AhCHeTaking in the good weather &amp; reviewing new materials from the @VAResearch team on some of the most pressing issues facing our veterans, including improving access to high-quality women’s health care. https://t.co/Q0lhPDkpEXWe have the resources to fix a badly broken immigration system and create a much fairer, more humane system that works. I will seek out every tool and resource available to stop these separations from occurring, while I continue to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform.The fact that this Administration is separating children from their parents at the border goes against our shared values as Americans. It is also appalling to task our customs and border patrol agents with inflicting this type of harm.To inflict this level of trauma on some of the most vulnerable can only be described as a crisis of conscious within the Trump Administration that in turn reflects on our country as a whole.We, as a nation, have a moral obligation to assist these families. As a mother of three, my heart breaks at the thought of these children waking up each morning not knowing when they will be with their parents again. https://t.co/NXvS9t7ztbWishing a happy 243rd birthday to the @USArmy. Since its inception, our Army soldiers have continued to answer the call to service &amp; selflessly devote their lives to protecting the Constitution of the United States.When we talk about ensuring women have access to high-quality and affordable health care, THIS is what we are talking about. It is about making sure women everywhere, regardless of race or income level, have the opportunity to make the decisions that work best for them. https://t.co/Aq086pYx1zCongratulations! https://t.co/WYTmjz03dTConnecticut has been hit especially hard by this epidemic. In cities and towns throughout Connecticut, families have shared with me devastating stories of confronting opioid addiction. We cannot let our families and communities continue to suffer. https://t.co/KMyZmNyXDMIt's important we include pharmacists in the conversation about how to confront the opioid crisis moving forward--they are crucial in this fight! https://t.co/JFFsSjzaPOToday, and every day, we are #OrlandoStrong. #DisarmHate #HonorWithActionBecause, ultimately, #LoveWins. I know that we will turn our grief into love and progress. That, despite this horrific event, we have seen the strength of our LGBTQIA+ &amp; Latinx communitiesAnd not just a vote on gun safety, but we must also speak out against violence &amp; discrimination as well. We need to bring federal anti-discrimination laws into line with our American values.They deserved so much more. Their lives were painfully and tragically cut short. This Congress owes them the respect they deserve. And that means holding a vote.Here we are, two years later and still not a single vote in Congress on gun safety legislation. This is not how we should be honoring the victims of Pulse Nightclub shooting.We must take action to stop the terrible epidemic of gun violence, which takes 92 lives on a typical day in our country. So many bright futures robbed. So many families torn apart. So many communities left to pick up the shattered pieces.Hatred or violence targeting any community – whether based on religion, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or anything else – is a betrayal of our values as Americans.But words, on their own, are not good enough. We need to address the root causes of this attack and work together to prevent more families from suffering the same heartbreaking loss.It is two years later, and I want the survivors and families of this tragedy to know that I still continue to stand with them, to grieve with them.On the anniversary of the #Pulse Nightclub shooting (and during #Pride Month), we ought to remember that no one should live in fear or endure violence because of who they are and who they love. https://t.co/Bg2CQUz5BnNearly a month after the May 15 storm that devastated #Brookfield &amp; a number of communities across CT-5, folks are still working to rebuild their homes. Unbelievable sight to see. https://t.co/NUcds4SbxMThis is awful: SCOTUS has essentially voted to uphold targeted disenfranchisement that will disproportionately remove poor &amp; minority voters. The fact that someone doesn’t vote in one election doesn’t mean they should lose their access to #VotingRights. https://t.co/wDI5Dac3CyWe still have plenty of work to do in order to make sure our friends, families, and neighbors receive the attention and supplies they need to get back on their feet. https://t.co/EWp8kUoEtjI am pleased to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to guarantee all employees have access to the allocated resources devoted to their professional development and wellbeing.At a time when Congress rightly is being called upon to seriously address long-standing issues of sexual harassment in our workplace, we have an obligation to provide better resources to our members &amp; staff. Making more funds available to OEA is an important step for us to take.No company, no state or federal agency would have an employee assistance staff of six to serve 9,000 employees. Neither should the House of Representatives. Our dedicated staff deserve better.OEA is primarily responsible for assisting employees whose job performance may be negatively affected by professional and personal issues. Currently, OEA's six staff members are expected to serve over 9,000 employees.Late last night, the House voted to pass my amendment to H.R. 5895, which would allocate the Office of Employee Assistance (OEA) additional funding and resources. https://t.co/Fw9GlaToX4We should be spending our time and resources embracing science to solve the longstanding economic and environmental problems facing the American people--issues like climate change, air pollution, contamination of our waterways. Instead, we have to deal with issues like this. https://t.co/6vDedtyf8gTrailblazers like Estelle Griswold changed the course of history for women across the U.S.. #GriswoldvCT brought us closer to achieving full social &amp; economic justice for women. 53 years after this landmark decision, there is no turning back. #ThanksGriswold #ProtectTitleX https://t.co/01R5iVTQiwThank you for your years of support and advocacy on behalf our nation's veterans and their caregivers! https://t.co/MZhQ1c5MqmWho told Betsy DeVos this was a good idea?

https://t.co/bvnMNdUAcDThis afternoon, I released the following statement after the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act. I am proud to that three of my amendments were included in this bipartisan bill! https://t.co/aKWPFfILxaImproving our nation’s water quality should continue to be a priority for Congress. That is why I released the following statement today, regarding the Water Resources and Development Act (WRDA) of 2018. I am proud to say that three of my amendments were added to the bill! https://t.co/n2AwWyckDcI joined students from across the nation to address mounting concerns about the gun violence epidemic that is plaguing our country. It’s time for us to come together and build consensus--- by working together, we can change the culture around gun violence. https://t.co/kIkNFD6ZDXHonored I had a chance to spend the day with Amandalyn and Torry for #NationalFosterYouthDay, who are using their voices to advocate for change in our foster system. Thank you to the National Foster Youth Institute for making this possible! https://t.co/E7BiQ5dDdQWhen our workforce is strong, our country is strong. Proud to support our servicemen and women as they re-enter the workforce after serving our nation. Our communities are better for it! #Flex4Forces https://t.co/QA4vzeqYzlThe gun industry, which already has special protection from civil liability and is already exempt from many federal health and safety regulations, does not need any more assistance from this Administration.This proposal will threaten the security and stability of communities across the globe and is likely to lead to increased violence and crime, harming the well-being and quality of life for folks everywhere.This proposal is a thinly-veiled attempt at boosting falling gun sales by making it easier to export semi-automatic rifles, handguns, and sniper rifles to other countries.This is another yet another example of the Trump Administration promoting the economic interests of the gun industry over the lives and safety of Americans across the country and now, people around the world. https://t.co/Yuku3uE477The House voted to increase veterans’ benefits by providing a cost of living adjustment. That means more money in our veterans’ pockets. https://t.co/6na3qmyl6xIf you and your staff are matching in green sweaters and you don’t take a picture, did it really even happen? https://t.co/BZg9t3fwKdA trailblazer in her own right during her time at UConn as the university's first women president.

I am so proud to have three wonderful veterans on staff. I am so appreciative of the work they do not just for my office, but on behalf of folks across CT-5. Thank you for everything &amp; I am so happy to know you all. https://t.co/LPj7TF8oIKIf Congress fails to vote to protect the American people from the scourge of gun violence, the American people need to vote to change Congress. https://t.co/q2hAU78qByI am calling on my colleagues to come together to rewrite the Farm Bill &amp; to find a better, balanced, &amp; bipartisan approach that funds these essential agriculture and food programs.And these hardworking dairy farmers make a critical contribution to our economy here in CT &amp; to our quality of life. I will continue to support bills &amp; amendments that allow for balanced reforms to benefit CT farmers, consumers, &amp; tax-payers w/o gutting vital anti-hunger efforts.As for our dairy farmers? Well, milk prices have dropped almost 40% in the last few years, and dairy farmers in New England are struggling to bring in the revenues they need to stay afloat.In fact, over 56,000 hardworking people in Connecticut are eligible for and participate in food assistance programs.Cutting more than $23 billion in nutrition assistance for families is simply wrong. SNAP is critical to preventing hunger and combating poverty in Connecticut and across the country, particularly for families with children and disabled veterans.I am disappointed that the Farm Bill we were presented with today—despite provisions helpful to Connecticut’s dairy farmers—fails to protect the health and welfare of too many Americans. https://t.co/8X7zopjy3iReminder: this change in priorities won't reduce the rate of abortions. It will, however, make it harder for women to access vital reproductive services. I still do not understand why this administration is so focused on restricting care for those who need it most. https://t.co/2A9KltLxzUThank you for all of your efforts in making sure folks in our communities get the resources and assistance they need! https://t.co/FHhdukpaHoNo. Not again. https://t.co/PYcmdJ5z3MOur nation has made enormous strides toward equality in recent years.

We will never stop working to protect your freedom to live as who you are, with the dignity and respect that every human being deserves. #IDAHOTBHumbled to have attended &amp; participated in the Women in Military Wreath Laying Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. It was an honor meeting today's honorees, all of whom exemplify the meaning of the word courage &amp; who share the value of answering the call to service. https://t.co/72oFW5ZtAPDuring #NationalPoliceWeek, it is important to take the time and reflect on our men and women in uniform and their families who sacrifice so much for our country. With this bill, we are doing our part to make sure they can return safely to their families.Our police men and women faithfully serve our communities day in and day out. The Protect and Serve Act of 2018, a bipartisan bill we passed last night, will make it a federal crime to intentionally target a law enforcement officer. https://t.co/xVQIGafxWnToday, this Congress had the opportunity to honor and support veterans of all service eras by voting for this bill. It is time we treated our injured veterans of all eras equally and expand VA caregivers programs to all injured veterans.That is why since being elected to Congress, I have authored legislation in every session to expand this assistance for family caregivers. My bill, the CARE for All Veterans Act, was included in the VA MISSIONS Act, which passed the House 347-70.Family caregivers, the true partners in delivery of healthcare to our veterans, provide loving and essential care at home to our injured veterans from bathing and dressing, housework, and transportation, to administering physical and medical therapies.Since my first days in Congress, I have heard from veterans and their caregivers about the important assistance provided through the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. https://t.co/fprCTCyCydImportant information for #Southbury residents below! https://t.co/OfoIiksIN7Climate change – and the threat it poses to the sustainability of our planet – is the greatest challenge of our time, but it also provides us with the opportunity to make smart policy decisions about our environment now. https://t.co/zi1SoQxOlDCongratulations are in order to Lincoln Middle School Principal Dianne Vumback in #Meriden &amp; #Farmington High School Principal Dr. Bill Silva on their awards as @CAS_ct's Middle School + High School Principals of the Year.

Investing in these sites enables communities to turn them into viable places to work &amp; live. https://t.co/8BzxQny4RSWhen women pay the bills, the pay gap matters. When women buy groceries to put food on the table, the pay gap matters. When women plan for their retirement, the pay gap matters. #Momsdontneed attempts to undermine pay equity—they need tools to ensure equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/2bIS9kDcKbBehind their joke is a serious sadness in how we treat our veterans. We ought to be doing right by them from the start. I’m turning to my colleagues to support these bills that will transform the lives of veterans across our country when these bills come to the floor for a vote.Some of these bills are ideas decades in the making. I hear time &amp; time again from veterans across CT about how important legislation like the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is. They joke they are glad they “didn’t die before seeing this bill go forward.”Plus, we’re taking additional steps to ensure that the veterans peer counseling program includes a sufficient number of peer counselors for women veterans and will focus on the mental health needs of female veterans (Peer-2-Peer Counseling Act).And, included in the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is legislation to assist veterans exposed to Agent Orange and in the Korean DMZ so that those exposed during a period of testing become eligible for compensation and healthcare benefits.Also, we’re doing more to ensure veterans are able to receive medical treatments and compensation for their exposure to toxic substances that affect the quality of their day-to-day lives long after their military service has ended (Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act).We’re making good on our commitment to our wounded warriors by ensuring their family members have the resources they need to care for them at home (CARE for All Veterans Act, which will be included in the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Outside Networks Act).And furthering our understanding on how medicinal marijuana can help veterans manage chronic pain by expanding our research efforts into the issue (VA Medical Cannabis Research Act).Like ensuring our heroes’ benefits keep pace with the rising cost of living and putting more dollars in the hands of the men and women who served our nation and their families (Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Act).Yesterday, during the House Veterans Affairs Committee markup, several of my bills and amendments to help veterans were cleared to go to the House floor for a debate. That means we’re doing more to take care of our veterans. https://t.co/7JN6zvXxTIWe cannot truly honor the sacrifices of our military men and women if we aren’t fulfilling our commitment to them to after their service has ended. Far too many veterans today don’t receive access to health care and the resources they need to be successful after their service.And, as the weather gets nicer, I am looking forward to getting back out on the trails &amp; enjoying the hard work folks put into making these paths so wonderful. Maybe my friend @rosadelauro will want to join me there, as it goes through both our districts!They’re also working on updating the part of the trail that runs through Ansonia, but a number of towns in CT-5, including Waterbury, Watertown, Thomaston, &amp; Torrington, fall along the Greenway.While I am in DC for votes &amp; meetings, my staff back in CT will often attend meetings on my behalf. Today, Billy from my office joined members of the Naugatuck River Greenway for an update from Thomaston &amp; Torrington officials about their efforts to improve parts of the Greenway. https://t.co/AXHPu4I6gIHad a great time meeting with eighth grade students from Canton Middle School, who are in Washington for their class trip. Enjoy the rest of your trip...and the warm weather! https://t.co/NXoPW1YqFxMy thoughts on the President’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran Deal: https://t.co/MYmKATbtQCDaniela, you are an incredibly special person who is making a positive difference in the lives of families across Connecticut. I am beyond proud to represent you in Congress. https://t.co/OaZtL3KXclSo proud of Jody, who works in my New Britain office and was presented with the Congressional Staffer of the Year award from the Federal Executive Association of Connecticut. Thank you for all of your hard work on behalf of the office and CT-5! https://t.co/wUP9PwEvr1Congratulations to Mary Lynn Ortiz, the owner of Borinquen Bakery in #NewBritain. Earlier today, Mary (who dreamed of following in her father’s footsteps &amp; owning her own bakery) was recognized with the SBA’s Minority-Owned Business of the Year award. https://t.co/SpRMKXV5shEffectively cutting off the access to care for those who most need it is incomprehensible to me. I will forcefully oppose--and women and men throughout this country will forcefully oppose--any attempt to rob Americans of health services that they depend on for survival.We need more access to quality health care, not less. This change in priorities will not reduce the rate of abortions. What it will do, though, is make it harder for women throughout the country to access vital services like pap tests, HIV screenings, and breast exams.Title X exists specifically to ensure comprehensive, evidence-based contraception, and reproductive health services to people across the country—including thousands of patients right here in Connecticut.The Trump-Pence administration’s and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ decision to change Title X programs is affront to the millions of men &amp; women who depend on Planned Parenthood for vital health care services. https://t.co/qcX1FWLhYrPleased to see Connecticut continue to lead by example in preventing future gun violence after a bipartisan vote in the House to ban the sale of bump stocks last night. Another positive step forward in keeping our communities safe. https://t.co/0hTSuPsGJNMore &amp; more young people do not want to own a car. And, with investments in mass transit and ride sharing features, we can attract businesses and families who are looking for an easy commute. https://t.co/JmCgOXIRTLWe all know the value of making investments in our infrastructure systems: it's an investment in safety, jobs, and the competitiveness of American-owned businesses. But when we talk about these investments, we need to get creative and meet the needs and values of the people.Agreed--transforming these abandoned spaces into economic assets is truly one of the best investments we can make. https://t.co/nGVlRN0y3OI look forward to continuing my bipartisan work on this issue as we find new and effective ways to expand opportunities for working families both in our state and across the country.I've worked with colleagues on both side of the aisle to expand career opportunities in American manufacturing through educational and job-training programs. https://t.co/2JXHCvdDEOAnd, with the support of strong educational partnerships, cross-industry collaboration, and outreach, this investment will accelerate and enhance initiatives to boost innovation, worker skills, infrastructure investment, and job creation.Connecticut is built on its strong manufacturing tradition and thrives as a national leader in manufacturing, particularly for the defense industry. We need to keep investing in our most important resource – our people. https://t.co/wqnuaOxFMAThis is one step of many I plan to take during my remaining time in office to challenge the issue of sexual violence, and I look forward to continuing this conversation with my colleagues.It recognizes the unique needs of these survivors &amp; calls for research that draws attention to the disproportionate levels of sexual violence and the impact of sexual violence on a diverse survivor population.The Resolution affirms a commitment to elevate the voices of historically under-served communities and currently disenfranchised in an effort to end sexual violence and provide support for survivors.We need to affirm our commitment to elevating the voices &amp; needs of historically disenfranchised communities in the effort to end sexual violence including immigrant survivors, survivors with disabilities, survivors of color, survivors of child sex abuse, and LGBTQIA+ survivors.They will have the resources they need readily available to them so that they may advocate for themselves &amp; their communities.And that’s exactly why I am saying something. Just because this happened does not mean I should exclude myself from the conversation &amp; not try to change the culture so that the next generation of leaders will not have to endure such treatment.I can see how, to some, me speaking out about this seems hypocritical. They may ask themselves, “How can she support this resolution when something so awful happened in her own office?”April is #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth. But for the survivors of abuse, their pain &amp; experiences cannot be resolved in a calendar month. We must do more. That’s why I have signed on as a cosponsor of the Sexual Assault Awareness Month Resolution.What frightens me, though, is that these numbers may actually be much higher. Sexual violence is an under-reported crime, especially among those living with a disability, where they are at an increased risk of being sexually assaulted.In fact, the same National Women’s Law Center 2017 Let Her Learn Survey found that 1 in 5 girls aged 14 to 18 has been kissed or touch without consent, including 24% of Latina girls, 23% of Native American girls, and 22% of Black girls.According to the National Women’s Law Center 2017 Let Her Learn Survey, it found that 38% of LGBT teen girls reported experiencing sexual violence, compared to 21% of all girls.And when you break it down by group, the rates are even higher: Among transgender people of color, 65% of Native Americans, 59% of multiracial people, 58% of Middle Eastern people, &amp; 53% of African Americans are likely to have been sexually assaulted.According to a 2015 US Transgender Survey, 47% of transgender people are sexually assaulted.And it goes beyond what happened in my office—this issue is systemic across the board. It spans across organizations, businesses, universities, and even into our classrooms. The more people I talk to, the more I realize how commonplace this behavior has become.When I look at what happened in my own office, and despite the mistakes I made in handling this particular situation, I am able to see and understand how this culture can be created and maintained.For far too long, survivors of sexual violence have been forced to live in a culture that thrived off their silence—a culture that became complicit in their suffering.My bipartisan bill continues the important work of encouraging more people – and especially women – to consider careers in the high-skill field of aviation and aerospace.Women bring new perspectives, backgrounds, &amp; problem solving skills to the table – traits we know are necessary to compete for the high-wage jobs of the future. With an aging aviation workforce, we must do everything in our power to broaden &amp; deepen our pool of available workers.At a time when only six percent of pilots are women, and women comprise just over a quarter of air traffic controllers, we need to elevate the initiatives happening in the private sector to encourage women to join this important sector of the workforce.This morning, the House voted to pass the FAA Reauthorization Act. The bill, which extends FAA funding for five years &amp; authorizes various Federal Aviation Administration programs also included my bill, the Promoting Women in the Aviation Workforce Act. https://t.co/m44bD3AOQRInspired by students like Jasmine who continue to find and to use their voices in such creative and moving ways. https://t.co/2lyyw3jFBvI am pleased to say that the House just voted to include my bill as an amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act. We're one step closer to encouraging more women to pursue careers in the aviation and aerospace industries!Earlier today, I spoke on the House floor to urge support for my bipartisan bill, Promoting Women in the Aviation Workforce Act. https://t.co/hrKnLY6pRxA great leader who shares our commitment to democratic ideals and values. @EmmanuelMacron, thank you for sharing your inspiring message today. https://t.co/xw3gGUAYtoHelping communities &amp; businesses redevelop abandoned properties is one of the most important steps we can take to boost local economies. With the proper investment and planning, we can revitalize these old sites &amp; create jobs &amp; improve the quality of life in nearby neighborhoods. https://t.co/MrKwUxhPuPThat’s why @rosadelauro, @JohnLarsonCT, @jahimes, @RepPeteKing &amp; @RepMikeTurner, &amp; I introduced the Brownfields Redevelopment Tax Incentive Reauthorization Act, which reinstates tax incentives to help spur the redevelopment of brownfields sites. https://t.co/QXY8tbLzPYBrownfields are more than just eyesores: they can be hazardous to the environment and to public health. And, according to an EPA study, there are 66 brownfield sites found throughout central &amp; northwestern CT. https://t.co/jVsMjkeiH4In #Meriden discussing what else we can do to make sure our seniors have access to the resources and information they need to stay informed about changes to their social security and healthcare. https://t.co/pUNoR8xBSWForever inspired by these students who are standing up and standing together to take action in preventing gun violence in our communities. https://t.co/pdNxz0lnMwLet's end the terrible uncertainty that these hardworking young men and women are dealing with now, and have the conversation about how we can fix the underlying problems in our immigration system. The need for bipartisan action has just become even more urgent. #GiveUsAVote https://t.co/iDAhqP5D6BI’m proud to support the #QueenOfTheHill rule to give the American people the debate they deserve. These young people have waited long enough.Dreamers serve in our military, teach in our schools and give back to our communities. We owe it to them to have a conversation about creating viable pathways to citizenship that recognize their service to our country.And 245 of my colleagues agree: that, despite overwhelming support for a #DACA solution, it is shameful the House has not been allowed to vote on this issue.Nobody has ever claimed that DACA is a perfect solution. Temporary protection for hardworking young immigrants is no substitute for the comprehensive reform we need to fix our broken immigration system.An incredible milestone for @neckerstoyland in #Simsbury. Congratulations on 70 years of success—and here’s to many more!
https://t.co/5NyYLTbj8WI’m pleased that even during times of divisive rhetoric, we’re able to recognize the importance of encouraging the next generation of workers on a bipartisan basis.My bill was marked up last week during a recent @Transport hearing. You can view my remarks here: https://t.co/aarkJORsTp.Less than 10% of airline mechanics, flight engineers, repair personnel, and airline pilots are women. And with nearly a fifth of aerospace engineers nearing retirement age, filling those jobs are vital to keeping our aerospace &amp; aviation industries up &amp; running.And that is exactly what my bill, the Promoting Women in Aviation Workforce Act, is all about: ensuring education, training, mentorship, outreach, and recruitment opportunities for women to bring them into the aviation industry.Women like Shults bring invaluable experience &amp; skills to the table. We ought to be providing women the tools &amp; resources they need to be successful in aviation.It’s no wonder that Shults’s family &amp; friends describe her as a pioneer in the aviation field, and as a woman who broke barriers to pursue her goals. She faced discrimination along her path to success, but she never let it stop her. Instead, it motivated her more.As a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot, she understands the importance of being properly trained &amp; prepared for all situations—especially the ones you hope to never find yourself in.Kudos to Capt. Tammie Jo Shults, whose quick thinking &amp; levelheadedness yesterday prevented an already dangerous situation into becoming something far more catastrophic. https://t.co/jOaRfe7rNLComing together at the table is only one part of the equation, but it is an important one. I plan to use the remainder of my term to continue these types of conversations &amp; to find bipartisan solutions that will help reduce the number of gun-related deaths in this country.It’s measures like this that we can implement that keep our families safe and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners. We do not have to pick and choose between the two.Last week, my colleagues and I introduced the Handgun Purchaser Licensing Act, which provides federal grants for states to implement "permit to purchase laws," which are statistically proven to reduce gun homicide deaths. https://t.co/7rwe6mMlD8It’s a step forward in talking about figuring out which laws &amp; policies actually work in keeping our children safe, wherever that may be. Whether that is at school. Or a movie theater. Or a concert. Or at church. Or simply on the streets.There is so much more we can do. And today’s bipartisan school safety forum, convened by @SenBillNelson &amp; @marcorubio, is one step forward by calling for lawmakers &amp; advocates to come together for a desperately-needed conversation.Parents like Nicole and Mark did not ask to become a part of this movement, a part of this narrative. Nor did folks in Colorado. Or Las Vegas. Or Sutherland. Or Chicago. Or Hartford.No, it is not Nicole that has failed. It is Congress. It is Congress that has failed families and communities across the country. It is Congress that has failed in its responsibility to take more meaningful steps to prevent gun violence.And that angers me. Because Nicole has not failed—Nicole has become a part of a larger movement to change the conversation and culture around gun violence. She has turned her tragedy into action.During today’s school safety forum, @NicoleHockley said that when she first heard about the shooting in #Parkland, she felt like she “failed.” https://t.co/dFCfnpwsrnProviding the CDC the tools &amp; materials they need to act on their findings as it pertains to gun violence prevention is a logical next step. https://t.co/ovukmKPSVbWell done, Tanner! Congratulations on your success and enjoy your upcoming trip to such historic and important WWI + WWII battlefields. What an exciting opportunity! https://t.co/tPjtQYIDPDThis bill just won’t cut it for Connecticut families. This will hurt our neighbors in need. We ought to go back to the table and put forward a bipartisan solution that does not place budget cuts on the back of the most vulnerable in our communities.Plus, with insufficient funding and vague language about how to implement new programs within the two-year required timeframe, these requirements are solutions in search of a problem.And changing the work requirements will ultimately do little to help unemployment. Rather, it will just add more red tape to the system.Cutting billions of funding over the next ten years in nutritional assistance for families is not reasonable reform. SNAP is critical to preventing hunger and combatting poverty in Connecticut and across the country, particularly for families with children and disabled veterans.This bill will hurt Connecticut families, where 13.9% of residents are food insecure and 6.0% are very food insecure—meaning thousands of families are living without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.Reading over the text of the #FarmBill &amp; stunned to discover some of my colleague’s still insist on cutting crucial funding from the SNAP program. As it currently stands, this bill would increase food insecurity &amp;hardship for many working-class families. https://t.co/Yb3U7lU31tCongratultions to @des_linden on becoming the first American woman to win the #BostonMarathon in 33 years. What an incredible accomplishment that will inspire generations of athletes to come. https://t.co/q1ZJ4tUtFUI am encouraged these strikes were targeted towards chemical weapon facilities &amp; carried out w/our allies in the United Kingdom &amp; France. However, continued engagement in Syria will require congressional approval. Having a debate &amp; a vote is the right thing to do for our country. https://t.co/6OlVJI3T3rWe can harness the resources and technology available to us today to change the conversation around gun violence. It's time for action.While there are more steps we can—and should—take to keep our families safe, this is an important step forward  that would make our communities safer while respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.Compare that to states like Missouri that repealed their permit to purchase law in 2007. Almost immediately, they saw their state’s firearm homicide rate rise by 25%.We’ve had this law in place here in CT for a number of years and the numbers don’t lie: it works. According to a 2015 study using CDC mortality data, permit to purchase laws reduced firearm homicides by 40%, which translates to 296 firearm homicides avoided.This bill, through federal grants, would incentivize states to enact laws requiring folks to obtain a license before purchasing a handgun and would close dangerous loopholes in our existing federal laws that put our families, friends, and neighbors at risk for harmWe must do more to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. That’s why yesterday, along with @ChrisMurphyCT, @SenBlumenthal, @ChrisVanHollen @RepRobinKelly, @RepAdams, and I introduced the “Handgun Purchaser Licensing Act.” https://t.co/7rwe6mMlD8Horrified to hear of the tragic events today in #NewMilford. These events are becoming all too common in our communities. As we continue to learn more about what happened, my thoughts are with the victims’ families at this time. https://t.co/y9woY4vb2zI hope to continue bipartisan conversations like this during the remainder of my time in Congress to ensure we properly fund research projects that will translate into healthier and safer communities.Everywhere I go in Connecticut, I meet people whose families have lost loved ones to drug addiction. The stakes are too high to limit access and make it harder for folks to get the care and treatment they need to overcome their addiction.And leading health researchers agree that combating the opioid epidemic needs to be a collaborative effort that prioritizes putting patients first— &amp; our research should determine which avenues of treatment work best.We need to find ways that encourage &amp; support the innovative work of companies like Protein Sciences that play a key role in keeping our communities healthy.@ProteinSciences, a biotech firm in #Meriden, is developing cutting-edge, life-saving vaccines to treat and prevent a variety of diseases, like their groundbreaking, egg-free flu vaccine, Flublok.And investing in research &amp; development means a more equipped and better prepared country to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.Understanding patterns of violence and what we can do to make our towns and cities safer requires a hard look at what policies work and what we can to do strengthen existing policies in place.Great meeting with @PeteSessions &amp; leading health experts to discuss the importance of investing in research &amp; development to confront public health concerns—like gun violence, an issue no community is immune to. https://t.co/2cKOhQ0AXiCongratulations to @SenDuckworth on the birth of her daughter, Maile Pearl (and for becoming the first sitting senator to give birth). Wishing you and your family all the best during this wonderful time!Let's keep supporting women &amp; girls who inspire us every day with their smarts, strength, &amp; perseverance in the face of adversity. And we can do that by paying them the same amount as their male colleagues for equal work. #EqualPayDayOver the course of a 40-year career, the average woman loses $418K to the #WageGap. And in CT alone, this costs women $15 billion per year. That’s less money to save for their retirement, for their healthcare, for their families, for their education.It’s 2018. It’s time we focus on ending pay inequality &amp; making sure all women have the opportunity to succeed in the workplace because even amongst women, there is still a pay gap. https://t.co/QkQkwlXnBUCongress should have a say in how we proceed in response to Assad’s attack on his own people. And our strategy should account for diplomatic avenues &amp; a thoughtful refugee policy to alleviate the terrible humanitarian crisis created by the ongoing violence

Be sure to check back here for updates and future town hall events.I am disappointed in this decision, and I look forward to the constitutional challenge the Administration should rightly face for this cold, calculated, and heartless decision.To go forward with this ban is a direct insult to these soldiers who fought to protect the very civil liberties this President seeks to hinder.This decision sends a shameful message to folks across the country--and frankly, to the rest of the world--that their government doesn’t care about their civil rights or their safety.Protecting the freedoms and rights of some does not impede on the freedoms and rights of others. That is an anti-LGBTQIA+ talking point with no real truth and merit.This decision is cruel and unconstitutional, and contradicts what Trump believes this will do: make our country safer. To ban transgender troops will make our country less safe &amp; send a clear message to the rest of the world about our values as a nation. https://t.co/GmnLjrs8RGIf you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.

We need to make everyone safer everywhere.Bold action would build on the positive aspects of @POTUS' proposal, such as closing the gaps in the NICS system, giving students and teachers the tools to spot and report signs of violence in our schools.... and only makes a vague call on states to adopt the kinds of extreme risk protection orders that have saved real lives in Connecticut. 

Where's the fearlessness? Where's the boldness?The administration's guns plan does nothing to expand background checks, says nothing about the gun lobby's dangerous proposal to ensure the proliferation of concealed weapons everywhere and at all times, offers zero $ for gun violence research ...Two weeks ago: I met with @POTUS at the @WhiteHouse, where he said that he wasn't afraid of the NRA and we shouldn't be either.

Today: the administration's plan is a near total surrender to the gun lobby.Can’t make it but want to tune into the event? We’ll be live streaming it on my Facebook page as well. Be sure to check it out!Final touches before today’s “Standing on the Shoulders of Giants” celebration at Grace Baptist Church in #Waterbury. Program starts at 1:30.

#GVROs work. Connecticut's experience proves it. And @RepDonBeyer, @RepCarbajal, and I say it's time to take them nationwide.
https://t.co/qwN4VupqzPAs I told @SecElaineChao this morning, real infrastructure investment = putting real dollars behind initiatives that work, not burdening state and local governments with even more costs they can't afford.

It was this: we have laws that work in Connecticut, laws that are already saving lives like gun violence restraining orders. Very glad to see @POTUS and @VP saying they support #GVRO - now let’s actually get it done. https://t.co/CU5cKLib3k3. I'm pleased that the president called on those in the room to stop cowering in fear of the gun lobby. Many desperately needed to hear it.2. Great to see shared appreciation for the need to expand background checks to all gun sales, a cause my good friend @ChrisMurphyCT and I have been championing for years.1. Great to see @realDonaldTrump, @VP, and countless others embrace the goal of expanding access to gun violence restraining orders in America. GVROs already saving lives in #CT and the other states that have them.

Our bipartisan leg w/@RepCarbajal &amp; @RepDonBeyer does this.We saw some encouraging signs at today's @WhiteHouse meeting with @realDonaldTrump and my House &amp; Senate colleagues on preventing gun violence in America.

Words are just words, though. I look forward to acting to really get something done.My heart is with the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students as they return to school today.

Students’ courage ended the Vietnam War. It fostered divestment from South Africa and change. And I believe that these students are beginning to turn the tide on gun violence. #MSDStrong https://t.co/zPVn1m5Z37Thank you, Steve. All of us have a stake in finally ending this epidemic of mass shootings. https://t.co/XJ7rVp18OkJoining @SRuhle on @MSNBC shortly to discuss my meeting with @POTUS today on reforming our gun laws ...You'll be pleased to know that I committed my support to the #NetNeutrality CRA earlier today - but that's not all I've done to try to preserve #NetNeutrality for #CT citizens.

Last year, I called on the FCC to investigate fake anti-net neutrality traffic on its site. https://t.co/70bbO75a0sOne of the most important things we do as Members of Congress = helping our #vets. 

We're blessed to have 40,000 of our heroes in central and northwestern Connecticut - if you're one of them and you need assistance, reach out to my office. https://t.co/QpSUx2xXbuHad a few brief moments to catch up with my son Jonathan last week. As they get older, every moment with my children becomes more and more important.

Like any mom, I’d do anything to keep my kids safe. It’s why I focus on preventing gun violence every day on this job. https://t.co/D9DcMBuGvwAR-15s and their variants were used in:

-Newtown
-Aurora
-Santa Monica
-San Bernardino 
-Orlando
-Las Vegas
-Sutherland Springs
-Parkland
-Mass shootings from Wisconsin to Colorado. 

It's not an accident that this specific weapon is chosen repeatedly.

https://t.co/5YTRzUb23GI agree with vets like @RepBrianMast and so many others: a semi-automatic rifle like an AR-15 - essentially the civilian equivalent of the M-16 - is a weapon of war with no compelling use off the battlefield. 

It's time to halt the sales of these weapons. Period.Good having a discussion with state leaders on the issues affecting #CT5 communities this AM. https://t.co/Mw4e5sYfOiLoved visiting Thorncrest Farm &amp; Milk House Chocolates in Goshen with @ChrisMurphyCT this afternoon!

Grateful that our bipartisan budget agreement invests more than $1 billion in America’s dairy farmers. https://t.co/ZqQfA5M3qqGlad to be joining 'Talk of the Town' on WATR -- tune in and join us. https://t.co/LBckUlTQSeWith @ChrisMurphyCT, @SenBlumenthal, @rosadelauro, @RepJohnLarson @lanemurdock2002, and Mark Barden of @sandyhook to call for stronger gun laws now:

https://t.co/ZKxN2JW9ZX“Veterans know first hand (that) until you’ve been shot at, and seen how people react in these situations, you can’t wrap your mind around it.” https://t.co/VDYQgsohKMAnd I certainly understand that, too. It's hard to imagine how anyone would feel in an emergency situation. All the more reason why arming our schools to the hilt isn't the solution. https://t.co/FsDWLfZq0zThe Good Guy with a Gun. https://t.co/nkARPFC75J@POTUS When we work together, we can really help people. https://t.co/zsESMf1TWsIn this job, it's easy to become cynical about the prospects for progress - but I'm proud that I've been able to get bills signed to help our vets, protect victims of human trafficking, and encourage entrepreneurs since @POTUS took office.Yet another disturbing revelation from the Special Counsel's investigation. https://t.co/sWhJZ2zpS2
