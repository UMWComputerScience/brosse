Indeed, in many instances, Mr. Trump himself has stirred the seeds of bigotry.One would think that an American President in the 21st Century would be dedicated to eradicating racism once and for all.The hope that his actions as President would not match his political rhetoric is becoming more and more of a distant dream.Mr. Trump‚Äôs repeated acts of disrespect for the 33 million Americans of Hispanic descent are historic in modern times.Then, @realDonaldTrump made his final cabinet selection, leading to no Hispanic representation in the cabinet for the 1st time in 36 yrs.While in DC, 40 migrant students from TX34 were subjected to comments of ‚Äúbeaners," ‚Äúburritos," and "wetbacks‚Äù from Inauguration attendees...but yesterday, two days before the Inauguration, two things occurred that leave me no choice but to boycott the event.I had hoped that this Friday‚Äôs Inauguration would be a moment of healing and outreach...Today, we remember Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and honor his legacy of promoting freedom and equality for all Americans. https://t.co/vsBU55uSrbThank you to law enforcement officers for your selfless service.
