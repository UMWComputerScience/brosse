An update on the #PawneeFire. Steady progress is being made. https://t.co/pIQTdMuMELI witnessed a horrific scene inside an ICE detention center in South Texas last weekend. I think it's important to speak out and share the stories of these families that have been forcibly separated. You can read my full account of the situation below  https://t.co/dEYrrhBJMCI'm devastated to hear of the mass murder at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis. There is no excuse, ever, for this type of violence, and my sympathies are with the victims' families and loved ones.@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Except Obama hit 5.2% and was above 2% 13 times from 2011-2016. https://t.co/C7qEd7dam8I’m delivering an update on the #PawneeFire live now on KPFZ radio, 88.1 FM, in Lake County.“‘More than 70 percent of this tax cut will be returned to workers,’ said White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

However, companies have instead used the extra cash to spend billions of dollars buying back their own stock.” https://t.co/pDOebrtRF7Unions who will now be forced to collectively bargain on the behalf of all employees in their unit without adequate funding. I believe that our police, firefighter, teacher, and other public-sector unions deserve better treatment, and don’t deserve to have their voices stifled.This case was not decided on the high-minded principles of the First Amendment. Rather, as shown by President Trump’s twitter feed, it is a transparent attack against the political power of public sector unions.Today’s decision by the Supreme Court creates a massive free-rider issue by eliminating the ability of unions to charge fair share fees for the non-union employees who benefit from the work union representatives do.THREAD - My thoughts on #JanusvAFSCME: Public sector unions are legally required to bargain on behalf of everyone in their shop, regardless of whether they’re a union member or not.My statement on the the Janus v. AFSCME Supreme Court Case. It's a transparent political attack on the organizing power of unions.

It was a common event during the abhorrent era of slavery.Right now, my colleague from Texas, Joaquin Castro, is describing the "baby room" where infants are kept in detention, away from their parents.Joining me now is my neighbor and colleague, Representative Jerry McNerney.Think about your own childhood. Think about that moment when you held your mother's hand, you were four years old, walking in the mall, and you lost her hand. Remember that panic. Mr. President, your polices are doing that to 2,300 young children.The man in the highest office of this nation made caging children an official U.S. policy. A nation whose reputation was one of humanity, concern and fundamental morality has taken a dark turn. Our President is holding these children hostage for a border wall.This young girl is crying out for our help. She is crying out to America for our basic humanity. For our basic morality. Every American bears responsibility if we collectively turn our backs on her. She joins thousands crying for our help from a cage. What have we become? https://t.co/GvlERA81s5I'm speaking out on the @HouseFloor now about the Trump administration's horrible family separation policy. Staff will live tweet and you can watch live on @cspan.Our remarks will begin at about 4:15 pm PT.

I'm leading an hour-long effort on the @HouseFloor tonight along with @JoaquinCastrotx, @RepJayapal, and other @HouseDemocrats to speak out against family separation. #KeepFamilesTogether.I'm proud to be one of the more than 190 members of the House that's fighting to #KeepFamiliesTogether instead of tearing them apart. https://t.co/gTyn30vvvvAs children we all memorized these words in our elementary school classrooms. Children are being used as hostages in a toxic debate over immigration. I am heartbroken.

#KeepFamiliesTogether. https://t.co/nJiuseRwdRIt will also increase child welfare training at Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and require DHS to allow separated families to reunite. Enough is enough. Tearing families apart is a subversion of American values and principles.1/ I just joined over 120 of my colleagues in the House in supporting the Keep Families Together Act of 2018. This bill, which is the House companion of Senator Feinstein's bill in the Senate, will put an end to the abhorrent practice of separating children from their parents.The Trump Administration's inhumane policy of separating children from their parents shocks the conscience. I will be leading a group of Democratic members to speak out against this atrocity on the House floor at approximately 7:15 pm Eastern, 4:15 Pacific, this evening.@Indivisible_Col STAFF RESPONSE: Mr. Garamendi will be speaking out about this inhumane practice at length on the House Floor tomorrow evening.Congratulations to @ucdavis for earning a $1.1 million grant from the National Science Foundation!

Let's put the middle class back to work by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure with American materials and workers.Ensure that the highest wage earners pay their fair share, so the middle class doesn't have to subsidize their tax break anymore.Create a tax code that makes it easier for middle class Americans to start a business or work for themselves from home. That goes hand in hand with expanding rural broadband access.Focus on small business tax relief that allows local businesses to hire more workers and provide better benefits.Prevent corporations from using a disproportionate amount of their tax savings on on stock buybacks and executive salaries. Force them to invest in wage and job growth for the middle class. They've proven that they won't do so unless they have to.It's obvious to me that the new tax law is a raw deal for the American people. The American middle class deserves #ABetterDeal--one that prioritizes real wage and job growth for low and middle income earners. Specifically, Congress should do the following...Of course it is, that was the plan all along. https://t.co/ebG5JIVio9Fewer than 45 of 500 corporations have shared their tax benefits with workers through bonuses, which – again – is not the same as raising wages. https://t.co/FnZPqAuwINThanks to the #TaxScam, Wall Street got to use the bulk of its tax savings for massive stock buybacks and bonuses. https://t.co/Zf9kg7xmFN"Well-Heeled Investors Reap the Republican Tax Cut Bonanza" https://t.co/ljMt6pGpT9"The boost to paychecks has frequently been small, and sometimes unnoticeable." Unless, of course, you're in the top 1% or run a major corporation. Because that's where 83% of the tax benefits in this law go. https://t.co/7Xl1m2lMou"Trump wants to make Wall Street great again." https://t.co/JeEFBU4xUm"Yet working-class, middle-class and upper-class Americans all hold negative views of the tax-cut law. Women who have graduated from college call the tax cuts a bad idea by nearly a 3-to-1 margin." 

https://t.co/kxKxh3REw1This tax scam also cuts taxes for corporations earning profits overseas, giving them more incentive to outsource jobs. https://t.co/KMhUu09hZe"The US government's budget deficit is about to explode — and the Trump tax law and spending surge is to blame." https://t.co/jpWhhk5AkZThis #TaxScam gives 83% of its benefits to the top 1%, including billionaires like @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/LAzkEGjX5iProbably because it undermines state and local tax deductions, which prevent double-taxation and help fund public education and services. https://t.co/xS4qxGWVVoAgain - people don't want Congress to pass tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and then offset the costs by cutting Medicare and Social Security. But that's exactly what Paul Ryan and others are angling to do. I won't stand for it. https://t.co/yaaUYbCmNIThis tax law takes an extra step to shove it to states like California by undermining the state and local tax deduction. https://t.co/qro5MPZ5v6GOP tax cuts put a burden on our children https://t.co/HKbmHv7thAHere's an idea: how about we talk about funding our public schools and bringing down health care costs instead of a tax cut that balloons the deficit in order to make the rich richer https://t.co/TSag9cjMaO"Alas: Americans have now been collecting post-tax-cut paychecks for more than two months — and they still don’t like Donald Trump’s signature legislative achievement." https://t.co/Lr6EccwXNYTurns out people don't want to have their Social Security and Medicare cut to pay for a #TaxScam that delivers 83% of its benefits to the top 1% and blows a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit. https://t.co/3m9KTEnirpBig banks just received the first installment of benefits corporate America will reap from the new federal tax law. The haul: more than $2.5 billion. https://t.co/udHkVN8gZ8"Not only are the tax cuts unwise, they’re unfair. Corporations saw their tax rate slashed from 35% to 21% -- a cut of 40%. The bottom three-fifths of the population, people making under $86,000 a year, will get a tax cut of about $1 a day on average." https://t.co/WVzmiL5u8rTax cut riches have gone to execs and investors over workers by nearly 3-to-1 margin

A: Corporate stock buybacks and higher executive salaries. https://t.co/lfkePOJFz9You can run a $1.5 trillion spending spree on your credit card, but eventually you'll have to pay the bill. https://t.co/cXhTqyJDcgIt's no wonder the tax law is losing support. It adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit, and now Donald Trump and Republicans say we must pay for it with cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. https://t.co/J3z9nrVGbuHow the Tax Cut President Trump Loves Will Deepen Trade Deficits He Hates https://t.co/6B8jiWVUTwMore money for major corporations means more stock buybacks, not significant job and wage growth as promised by the President. https://t.co/rx90bo0xy4Here's why the tax cuts are such a hard sell for Republicans https://t.co/vYjoManTxRThe American middle class isn't stupid. They know that these tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Now Congressional Republicans are talking about cutting Medicare and Social Security to pay for their #TaxScam. We won't allow that to happen.  https://t.co/MxpYkYAYDK"The Trump Republican tax law abandons any pretense of concern about debt and shows how the real purpose of the bill is to deliver an avalanche of tax savings to the already rich while tossing a few greenbacks to the vast majority." https://t.co/ArK495yeEIThanks to Trump, the big Wall Street banks saved $3.6 billion in taxes last quarter under new law https://t.co/6NooBmgmI0It seemed like life couldn't get any better for the big banks, then the #TrumpTaxScam came along. https://t.co/TnFePtw7lTThe #TaxScam helped save $3.6 billion for the big banks. And surprise, surprise, most of that money is going to stock buybacks and executive salaries. https://t.co/netvZ9EO1qThe Great Snake Oil Slump https://t.co/Wpow9fk1mhA plurality—42%–think the tax cuts favor the wealthy most of all.

They are the future, and with their wisdom and strength, the future is bright. https://t.co/AxN0E3JxNeI pray that Congress will gain the courage to act in solidarity with every victim of gun violence in America.Solutions like universal background checks, prohibiting the sale of assault-style rifles, and no fly no buy can help reduce gun violence in America without undermining the Second Amendment.Our hearts are heavy today for all of the victims and survivors of Columbine, and the best way we can honor them as lawmakers is to come together and pass commonsense gun safety reforms that an overwhelming number of Americans support.THREAD: Today, on the 19th anniversary of the Columbine Shooting, thousands of students across the country will walk out in a show of unity and strength against the gun violence epidemic in America.@indivisibleyolo @EPAScottPruitt @EPA I’m happy to report that I’m a proud co-sponsor.
