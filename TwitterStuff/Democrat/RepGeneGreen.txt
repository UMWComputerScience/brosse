Yes, some of the bills will help people avoid addictions to opioid medications and those already struggling to receive treatment, but there is not a sustained, long-term investment that’s needed to fight back.As the Ranking Member of the @EnergyCommerce Health Subcommittee, I’ve debated every opioid-related bill that has gone through our committee, and quite frankly, I am concerned that we put quantity over quality. https://t.co/T4yKvqGEmeToday, I voted 'Yay' on H.R. 6, SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, a bipartisan package of opioid-related provisions that passed 396-14. https://t.co/ZpqEUkmIIO #opioidcrisisThe @HouseGOP farm bill guts nearly $20B dollars from #SNAP-our nation’s most important and effective anti-hunger program. This could ultimately result in higher levels of hunger &amp; poverty, worse health, and other negative outcomes. We must #protectSNAP. https://t.co/1z5MJtzhObThe conservative bill failed today, which means the so-called GOP compromise bill is now TBD. https://t.co/SEjitVaaV8For the DREAMers, it provides no access to green cards or citizenship. It provides only temporary legal status for some DREAMers that can be renewed every three years but doesn’t allow them to apply for a green card, which means they won’t have access to citizenship.The first bill failed. Under the Goodlatte bill, legal immigration would be cut by 25 percent, or 260,000 fewer legal immigrants per year. It would do so by eliminating the diversity visa lottery and most existing categories of family-based immigration. https://t.co/7ntCG3EROG#SNAP is critical to more than 40 million Americans, including 10 million low-income Latino children &amp; families struggling to put food on the table.

The bill failed in May and will still cut $24 billion in #SNAP benefits.Trump chose to separate families at the border just as he chose to end DACA.  Now he is trying to use both as hostages to secure a host of anti-immigrant restrictions. I will vote 'Nay' on both crazy bills.

You can watch today's debate on @cspan: https://t.co/YK9J1QpeVmToday's immigration bills on the floor today are bad and worse. These bills do not provide a certain path to citizenship for DREAMers, eliminates legal immigration laws, like family reunification, and fails to solve the issues of family separation.

These junk plans will syphon off young, healthy people – damaging the ACA marketplaces and leaving everyone else with higher premiums.This week, the Trump Administration released a rule that will greatly expand association health plans, which are exempt from most of the ACA's essential health benefits, including maternity care, mental health, and prescription drugs.A lot is going on this week with the House voting on opioid and immigration legislation, families being separated at the border, and the Trump administration chipping away at the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/m93tSq8y5wSi usted ha sido residente permanente por cinco anos, esta es su oportunidad para hacerse ciudadano.

Now it will be the law for any child traveling with a parent to be treated as an unaccompanied minor and be separated from his or her family.It is heartbreaking to hear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan announced that the Trump Administration is adopting a zero-tolerance policy for those crossing the border. https://t.co/oF48xipbmTThese proposed increases are a result of the Trump administration’s plan to sabotage and undermine the Affordable Care Act. Make no mistake, the administration is not interested in working on bipartisan solutions to shore up costs and increase access to care.As expected, the decisions by the Trump administration to repeal the individual mandate penalty and expand short-term junk plans has caused uncertainty for health insurers and will lead to double digit premium hikes in Virginia and Maryland in 2019. https://t.co/29ukqCsxzLThe decision to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census will have long-lasting consequences for the future of Texas and will jeopardize the disbursement of funding for essential federal programs. #EveryoneCounts https://t.co/3VIClYrm3bOn #TeacherAppreciationDay I reflect on the hard work and dedication my wife gave to her students as an Algebra teacher @AldineISD for over 25 years.
