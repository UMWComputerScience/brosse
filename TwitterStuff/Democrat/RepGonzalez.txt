Watch more below (@kveotv23 ): https://t.co/BwntgZqCav70% of U.S. farmland will change hands and one fourth of our farmers will retire over the next three decades. Yet, the #GOPFarmBill underfunds outreach programs to beginning, returning veteran and underserved farmers, and provides no funding for scholarships at 1890s land grants.We get one shot at a farm bill every five years. The #GOPFarmBill could have taken steps to protect America’s agricultural workers from Trump’s disastrous trade policy – in fact many were asking for it.This evening, I will be testifying before the @RulesReps @RulesDemocrats about my amendment to S. 2372, the VA MISSION Act of 2018, that would repatriate deported veterans.
