Attending 20th anniversary celebration for the #Flushing branch of the @QueensLibrary. The facility is a wonderful place for literacy and learning. Thanks to its staff for the great work they do. https://t.co/5xdcEwB2vDSent a letter to @SecNielsen &amp; @SecAzar demanding an explanation of their inability to reunite separated families. It’s unacceptable that the federal government is struggling to match children to parents. We need to reunite separated families immediately. #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/5BDqNsfQU2Finished touring Children’s Village in Dobbs Ferry. Saw where children separated at the border are being housed. Facilities were well run but that’s no substitute for these kids being with their families. My impressions of the visit in the video below. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/TPEuoT9D3OPresently touring Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry, NY, one of the facilities housing children separated from their families at the border by the Trump administration. At the site w/ @SenGillibrand @NitaLowey @RepGregoryMeeks @RepEliotEngel @RepBRochester. #KeepFamiliesTogetherIn the wake of my visit to the U.S.-Mexico border last week, I’ve introduced two pieces of legislation that would improve conditions for children who have been separated from their parents. Details: https://t.co/6uHUPu4M2X. #KeepFamiliesTogetherJune is LGBT Pride Month, a time to celebrate the accomplishments of the #LGBT community and the victories of LGBT rights. While much progress has been made, our fight for equality and justice continues. Watch my video statement below. https://t.co/68qDt4p2NzThat’s why I introduced the Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act that will ensure veterans who cleaned up Enewetak Atoll are treated for their service-related injuries. This help is overdue &amp; I urge @HouseVetAffairs to work on this bill soon. https://t.co/2dR207lTjz https://t.co/psnRX3Q9gfSpoke w/ Rep. Bordallo, Vice-Speaker Therese Terlaje of the Guam Legislature &amp; radiation compensation advocate &amp; veteran Robert Celestial on helping veterans who were exposed to radiation get the treatment they deserve. Shameful that these veterans have not received proper care.I wholeheartedly agree with @SenGillibrand’s position that we need to ditch Trump’s shortlist of SCOTUS candidates. I hope the Senate will reject his list &amp; support someone who has bipartisan support. We need a strong candidate who will fight for every American.I’m appalled by #SCOTUS’ 5-4 ruling that will undermine the collective bargaining power of public sector unions. This will harm their ability to fight for workers’ rights. Proud to stand w/ unions &amp; support their critical work for working families. #JanusWith Congressional colleagues discussing our trip to the U.S.-Mexico border. Still trying to process all that I saw. Children in cages &amp; mothers who have no idea where their kids were taken are images I cannot get out of my head. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/etJ3czjOH4#SCOTUS’ decision on the President’s travel ban is a kick in the gut to all who oppose religious discrimination. It’s a terrible and un-American ruling that will be a horrible stain on the history of our nation. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/Tgg8qPmcRSSpoke to the @NYDailyNews about my visit to the border. https://t.co/uN46ith15y #KeepFamiliesTogetherMost of these mothers say they dealt w/ horrendous conditions to get to the US, fleeing violence from gangs &amp; cartels. But they say their real nightmare began when they arrived here &amp; had their children taken away from them under @RealDonaldTrump's policy. #KeepFamiliesTogetherJust left the Port Isabel ICE Detention Center. Met with about 30 mothers who were separated from their children. All were crying or had tears in their eyes. Most don’t know where their kids are. I talk about my meeting with them in the video below. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/QGMdWu0nMYJust toured the McAllen Border Patrol's Centralized Processing Center. Heartbreaking to see the impact that @RealDonaldTrump's policy is having on children &amp; parents. I describe what I saw in the video below. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/vtRQRbkgNpThis is what was provided to families separated at the border. Unconscionable that children were taken from their parents. Heard stories first-hand from advocates here in McAllen. Very troubling &amp; upsetting to hear. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/LIlbxWjhQ5I’ve arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. About to tour the McAllen Border Patrol Station and Centralized Processing Center. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/Q1zBzd8WqNI’ll be visiting the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen &amp; Brownsville, Texas on Saturday. Will be standing up for children &amp; parents separated at the border &amp; will tour facilities there. RT if you agree that families must be reunited as quickly as possible! #KeepFamiliesTogetherThanks @CongBoyle for introducing the Reunite Children With Their Parents Act. Proud to support this critical bill. We need to reunite the 2,300 separated children with their families. If this bill becomes law, it would require @DHSgov to reunite separated families in 60 days.Families separated by this administration must be reunited as soon as possible &amp; I call on @RealDonaldTrump to put forward an official plan to do so. It is unacceptable &amp; inhumane that families continue to remain apart. Their nightmares must end. #KeepFamiliesTogether 2/2.@RealDonaldTrump failed to include in his executive order any explanation on how &amp; when to reunite the estimated 2,300 children who were removed from their parents &amp; I’m deeply troubled-dismayed that a day after he signed it, there is still no clear plan to reunite families. 1/2I hope that this important pilot program will be implemented in all NYC schools. I also want to thank @ChaimDeutsch, @TeachAdvocacy, @info_safest15 and @Baag_USA for their steadfast leadership and support on this issue. 2/2Thanks @NYCSpeakerCoJo for creating a pilot program in the new city budget that will provide halal &amp; kosher lunches in NYC schools. For years, I've called for halal &amp; kosher meals to be made available to NYC students &amp; this initiative is the right step forward. 1/2 https://t.co/JBvunxu4LKPleased to see the Senate rejected Pres. Trump’s plan to rescind almost $15 billion in previously approved spending. Almost half of that amount would be from the Children’s Health Insurance Program. We shouldn’t target programs that provide health care for kids. That isn’t right. https://t.co/GA7OeLAiEDI thank all who signed the letter we sent to ICE: @SenGillibrand, @NydiaVelazquez, @repjoecrowley, @RepEspaillat, @RepYvetteClarke, @RepKathleenRice, @RepGregoryMeeks, @RepJeffries, @RepJoseSerrano, @RepEliotEngel, @RepMaloney.

His fight is not finished but very happy for him &amp; his family that he will be released. Pleased to have intervened in his case. But let’s not forget the many other families who still remain separated tonight. 1/2Met with the wife &amp; children of Xiuqing You, the Flushing, Queens man who was detained during his green card interview. I and members of NY’s Congressional delegation also sent a letter about You’s case to the head of ICE’s NY Field Office. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/tNzal7CzRpThank you @AmericanAir and @united for asking the federal government to not use your services to transport separated children from their parents. I applaud both of your decisions and completely agree. We shouldn’t be separating families. Period. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/jqukZgd7v6President Trump lied about his ability to stop his shameful policy of ripping children from their parents.  I want to know exactly how and when these families will be reunited, because at this point the President and his entire administration are untrustworthy. https://t.co/P3bJDXG2QiProud to be an original cosponsor of the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. We need to stop this administration’s practice of family separation. Families belong together &amp; separating children &amp; parents is cruel. Thanks to @RepJerryNadler for introducing the bill. #FamiliesBelongTogetherToday is Juneteenth, an annual celebration that marks the end of slavery in America. Since then, our path to building a more perfect union has experienced progress and setbacks. Our journey is not complete. Juneteenth demonstrates the promise of a better future.Xiuqing You, the Queens father with no criminal history who was detained at his green card interview, is the latest example of how the administration’s cruel immigration policies are destroying lives.

Unfortunately, women are still paid less than men despite doing similar work. That isn’t right &amp; we must continue to fight for equal pay for equal work.The census happens once a decade &amp; it’s critical that we have an accurate count of everyone. Including a citizenship question in the #2020Census is a bad idea. It’s unsettling to learn @SecretaryRoss knew that adding this question would be costly &amp; harm the quality of the count. https://t.co/diFwNonpuXPleased that the agency is working to tackle these problems and I will continue to make sure that officials follow through on resolving these issues. The @USPS must rebuild trust with borough residents. 2/2Met in Washington w/ @USPS Deputy Postmaster General Ron Stroman.

We shouldn’t be breaking families apart. #FamiliesBelongTogetherOn National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we #WearOrange to honor victims and survivors of #gunviolence &amp; show our resolve to stop future tragedies.

My thoughts are with the victims and all who are impacted. This senseless gun violence across the country has got to end. GOP leaders must stop refusing to act on common-sense gun safety legislation. #EndGunViolenceI oppose including a citizenship question in the #2020Census.

Honored to swear-in the organization’s officers during its first annual swearing-in ceremony. https://t.co/zu08qg1Jz3I, along with @repjoecrowley &amp; @RepGregoryMeeks have called on the head of #USPS to address ongoing &amp; serious mail delivery problems in #Queens. We’ve sent a letter to the Postmaster General demanding a plan to improve delivery throughout the borough. https://t.co/1L57HRq0b8As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I could not in good conscience vote for the FOURTH continuing resolution, a temporary funding measure, put forth by Republican leadership since the fiscal year began four months ago. https://t.co/EoNcEowLRDGreat to see continued leadership in New York on #menstrualequity! #MenstruationMatters https://t.co/hCEGgKDsKQConstituents can continue to contact my offices in Northeast Queens (Flushing), Forest Hills and Washington, D.C. For the phone numbers and addresses, please go to: https://t.co/zoCFBfg2tK 2/2Even though the government is shut down, my offices will remain open. My staff and I will continue to be available to constituents who need assistance with accessing the federal government. 1/2In the meantime, here is what you need to know about how the shutdown affects you. https://t.co/W95re7rYc4 4/4But the President &amp; Republican leadership refused to strike a deal. Democrats still want to reach an agreement &amp; I urge the President &amp; GOP leaders to now work w/ us in securing one. We must end the shutdown so government can reopen &amp; once again work for the American people. 3/4In the bill to fund the government, Democrats sought to fund pressing initiatives such as children’s health insurance, disaster assistance, keeping our nation safe &amp; help for the opioid crisis. We also sought to protect DREAMers. 2/4Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. Yet they allowed the federal government to shut down. 1/4The White House wants to decimate our legal immigration system by ending family sponsorship. This is unacceptable. We must continue to #ValueOurFamilies. #NoFamilyBanOne of the reasons we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s life &amp; legacy is his ability to empower everyday people to fight injustice. On this #MLKDay, I ask that you join me in reaffirming our commitment to fight against injustice wherever we see it. https://t.co/tZYLw1luvBJoining @SenJoeAddabbo and @BobHoldenNYC at Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony held by Boy Scout Troop 119 in #MiddleVillage. Honored to participate. #Queens https://t.co/VYsLAXg5VDRight move by @NYGovCuomo. The halted pilot program that restricted package delivery to NY prisons was draconian. Not only did it ban used books and fresh fruit and vegetables, it also put lower-income family members who cannot afford vendor prices at a severe disadvantage. https://t.co/SUogcoNf1vThis week, I was honored to take part in the #KoreanAmericanDay celebration on Capitol Hill and today I’m proud to wish Korean Americans in Queens and across the nation a very happy Korean American Day. (2/2) https://t.co/E7g1fR6DvYOn #Korean American Day, I salute the accomplishments and contributions that Korean Americans have made to America and the enormous and positive impact that the Korean American community has had on our nation.

Given the lack of consensus on the most effective ways to treat addiction, I’m determined to find out why SAMHSA has made such a harmful decision.For the first time since the 1960s, life expectancy in U.S. decreased for the 2nd year in a row largely due to the #opioid epidemic. I demand to know why @samhsagov terminated the contract for the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices. https://t.co/spLh3Lt9OP.@RepJudyChu, @RepJayapal, @RepMarkTakano and I are waiting to meet @SenatorDurbin to talk about #AAPI immigration priorities for ongoing #DACA negotiations.

Last year, AAPI DACA recipient Angie Kim, who grew-up in Queens, was my guest for POTUS’s first address to Congress to highlight the necessity and urgency of assisting #DREAMers. #DREAMActNOW https://t.co/fSRnn6e4ax@USPS @BobHoldenNYC @CMKoslowitz @RoryLancman @CMPeterKoo I’ve asked @USPS to let me know when these types of problems occur in the future. It is essential that the agency communicate about delivery problems that impact our borough. 3/3@USPS Thanks to everybody from all the affected communities who contacted my office about this problem &amp; thank you to Councilmembers @BobHoldenNYC, @CMKoslowitz, @RoryLancman &amp; @CMPeterKoo for working with me on the issue. 2/3Heard back from @USPS. The agency says that due to the recent storm &amp; lack of available regular carriers, they had missed deliveries throughout #Queens &amp; other parts of the area. Officials say service is back to normal &amp; that mail is being delivered to every home &amp; business. 1/3I’ve received a number of complaints from residents of #Maspeth, #MiddleVillage, #ForestHills, #RegoPark &amp; #KewGardensHills about problems w/ mail delivery. I have inquired with @USPS &amp; am working on the issue w/ Councilmembers @BobHoldenNYC, @CMKoslowitz &amp; @RoryLancman. #QueensSince TPS was granted to Salvadorans in 2001 after two devastating earthquakes, those who found refuge in the U.S. also found jobs, had families, contributed to our economy, and put down roots. It is senseless and cruel to expel these individuals. #SaveTPS https://t.co/HYntLQkb2x@NYCHA In 2016, @RepEliotEngel and I passed legislation into law requiring @HUDgov to issue model guidelines for minimum heating requirements at public housing agencies that receive federal housing funds. Nobody should be forced to endure cold temperatures during the winter. (2/2)Unacceptable that many @NYCHA residents are without heat. https://t.co/UsonWPSzno (1/2)The #opioid epidemic continues to shake our nation. One of the biggest hurdles in fighting the epidemic is a lack of agreement on the most effective way to treat addiction. That’s why I commend @samhsagov’s National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices. https://t.co/NsY2OuUq5tHeavy snowfall and strong winds over #Queens and the rest of #NYC. Please stay safe during the storm! For information and tips from @nycoem, go to: https://t.co/nnBGBMbO5c.Dangerous and reckless move by the Justice Department. Adding untested question on citizenship to 2020 census will likely lower response rates &amp; make census more expensive.

We are better than this. We have more compassion than this.
 
I sincerely hope the administration reconsiders. https://t.co/5Mvg5Cdw11A devastating story that further emphasizes our right to know what we are putting into our bodies.

Thanks to @UAW. https://t.co/iVRF0lh2pT @GWCUAWThe President says the tax bill will be a Christmas gift for Americans. But it will only be a present for corporations and the wealthy.

I will not hesitate to support legislation, including a CRA, to overturn this misguided decision &amp; permanently prevent throttling/censoring.Today marks 5 years since the lives of twenty children and six adults were taken due to gun violence at #SandyHook Elementary School. In this time, there have been 1,700 mass shootings, 170,000 gun deaths, and exactly 0 bills passed to reduce gun violence. #HonorWithAction https://t.co/6ALojAh2dzPleasure participating in round table discussion hosted by @CBWGCAUCUS, @HouseDemWomen, and @AAPolicyForum about how Congress can and must do more to listen and respond to the voices of black women and girls. https://t.co/853iZ95Jj5Tomorrow, the FCC votes on the future of #NetNeutrality.

I send my condolences and prayers to Mayor Lee’s wife and children, as well as to the people of San Francisco. 2/2Sad about the passing of #SanFrancisco Mayor Ed Lee. Mayor Lee was a dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly for the residents of San Francisco. An advocate for housing &amp; civil rights issues, he broke barriers to become San Francisco’s first Asian American mayor. 1/2I’m calling for an update to federal data collection standards on race and ethnicity in time for the 2020 #Census. Research shows that an update to these standards would improve data collection, which is essential for good public policy. https://t.co/nP5ELbeQiaGrateful that there were no fatalities in this morning’s explosion at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

As mass shootings become more frequent &amp; more deadly, Congress should be working to reduce gun violence, NOT unleashing even more guns on our streets &amp; putting our safety at risk.The #MuslimBan at its core is religious prejudice. Though SCOTUS has allowed it to take effect, we are NOT done fighting. Two federal appeals courts will soon hear challenges to the ban.

It was a pleasure sharing the stage with @ingridnilsen to discuss a topic that needs to be normalized: our periods. #PERIODCON2017 https://t.co/1DFusSZpwdNo matter the work environment, no employee should face sexual harassment. That’s why I voted to require sexual harassment training for all Members of Congress &amp; their staffs, fellows, &amp; interns, a policy that already exists in my own office. This is only the first step forward.After I hosted the first ever Capitol Hill panel discussion on #menstrualequity back in May, I’m thrilled that @UDCLaw &amp; @BRAWSorg put on a briefing to continue this crucial conversation. To achieve legislative success, we must normalize convos about periods. #menstruationmatters https://t.co/XCs8qUG1OmThis is the President of the United States posting unverified racist videos demonizing an entire religious group. This is not normal. This is not acceptable.
