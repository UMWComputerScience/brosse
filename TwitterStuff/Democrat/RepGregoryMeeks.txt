Do not let Trump off the hook until he fixes the messes he’s made.(1/2) Thank you everyone who voiced outrage over family separation, forcing Trump to end his policy. However, this EO detains children with their families instead of separating them; doesn't end the indiscriminate criminal prosecutions that caused this disaster to begin with...Some have tried to argue that compassion is a weakness; we know it is our strength.
