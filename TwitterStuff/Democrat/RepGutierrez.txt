Immigration reform means 3 things 1) LEGAL immigration so more people coming have visas, rights, vetting; 1.1) Eliminate backlogs; 2) Reduce undocumented population thru process of earned legal status; 3) Border &amp; national security targeting threats, not just children &amp; families https://t.co/TIkgO0KHPcSo, overall, good news: US attitudes towards immigration &amp; reform improving, but partisan gap is getting wider. Republicans more likely to hold inaccurate views and more likely to oppose #immigration. @WhiteHouse and @GOP disinformation campaign working, but only on GOP voters. https://t.co/ZmYGcPVw7bThanks, but you're wrong:  
8 in 10 Latinos are US citizens. Of the remaining 2 in 10 non-citizen Latinos, more than half are here legally (most can apply eventually for citizenship) and a little less than half (about 10% overall) are currently undocumented.
@pewresearch https://t.co/o5ljT1Mp9hBut there is growing partisan gap. More Republicans say immigrants are less likely to adapt today to US ways than immigrants from early 1900s. Sustained @GOP &amp; @WhiteHouse disinformation campaign working on GOP voters; not so much on rest of us.
#FamiliesBelongTogether #twill https://t.co/u1I1lQyZx8Most ppl say today’s immigrants are either about same (32%) or more willing to adapt (26%) to US way of life compared to immigrants who came in early 1900s. Fewer (36%) say today’s immigrants less willing to adapt. Shifting Views on Legal Imm. @pewresearch https://t.co/IauHmKO2QF https://t.co/hYrpCnhkyJAbout 80% of US Latinos are US citizens; 93% of Latinos under 18 are US citizens; 1 million US citizen Latinos turn 18 every yr on avg. Obviously these realities drive disinformation campaign &amp; efforts to keep citizens from voting for @GOP &amp; @WhiteHouse.
#KeepFamiliesTogetherThose who get it WRONG and think most immigrants are here ILLEGALLY (~75% are here legally) are more likely to think immigrants commit crimes (they are less likely that US-born to commit crimes):

More than twice as many (67%) say they don’t think of it this way. https://t.co/ZmYGcPVw7bAbout 75% of America's immigrants are here legally, but in Pew poll just 45% say most immigrants living in US are here legally; 35% say most immigrants are in US illegally.

Los niños y niñas - casi todos ciudadanos estadounidenses - son los que siempre sufren más, ya que sus vidas personales y escolares son interrumpidas. https://t.co/aAMmp62BlfMy message to the families is that despite how this President treats Hispanics in #PuertoRico Tennessee and everywhere else, you are not alone and we will fight for your families. Thank you @tnimmigrant for all you do. https://t.co/kHo8Qk4umcThe President says Mexicans &amp; Latinos are criminals, rapists and murderers, yet the immigrants he goes after are those working at jobs supporting their families.
