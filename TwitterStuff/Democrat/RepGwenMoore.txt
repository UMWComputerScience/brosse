Trump is planning to jail 7,500 kids &amp; their families in tents on military bases. Indefinitely.

Today, Milwaukee and communities across the country came together to say, enough.

Family incarceration is NOT the solution to family separation.

#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/zS88hdcQexWho owns Trump?

Convicted Russian money launderer, @DeutscheBank gave @realDonaldTrump over $1B in loans after he defaulted... You've got to follow the money to find the answer.

I'm on the hunt for the truth w/ @RepMaxineWaters. Release the records! https://t.co/NJJ7juaTXEAt Gee‚Äôs Clippers w/ my sister in the struggle @RepBarbaraLee.

130 million Americans live with pre-existing conditions. Under the ACA, we are all covered. Trump and the @GOP will strip that coverage if we do not resist and speak out.‚ÄúThe right to vote is the most powerful, nonviolent tool we have.‚Äù

Shelby, Korematsu, Dred Scott, and now, Trump v. Hawaii. Today's decision joins a line of rulings our children will look back on in shame. #WeWillNotBeBanned¬†#NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/XxjSV6OhtFHarley-Davidson workers are just the latest victim of President Trump's erratic policies, and you can bet they won't be the last. Wisconsinites need leaders in Washington who work to protect good-paying American jobs instead of throwing them under the bus. https://t.co/sLoSM7Oxyd3 years ago, love won when SCOTUS recognized marriage equality for LGBTQ+ Americans. Yet too many LGBTQ+ Americans continue to face discrimination at home, at work, and in their communities every day. It's time for Congress to move #EqualityForward by passing the Equality Act. https://t.co/xIxobdh1HdIt is because of #NetNeutrality that entrepreneurs are able to start and grow their businesses online.

We must #SaveNetNeutrality and prevent Internet Service Providers from pricing these businesses out of the online marketplace. https://t.co/NX7bD1pgOqIn the 5 years since the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v.

Spoke to 60+ women. Many had babies taken directly from their arms.

They‚Äôve requested information about their kids, but have heard NOTHING in return.

They were lied to, deceived, &amp; don‚Äôt know where their babies are #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/UbI2M3u2nUThe conditions these children are being held in are extremely distressing. These families are vulnerable, seeking safety and asylum, but they‚Äôre being treated like subhumans. #ZeroToleranceForZeroTolerance https://t.co/nkETWJ4iswAt the US border visiting families and children who have been torn apart by @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs zero-tolerance policy. 

It‚Äôs extremely unclear what legal rights these children have. There‚Äôs no justice in mass trials. #FamiliesBelongTogether #ZeroToleranceForZeroTolerance https://t.co/EVGZaPhCawEnough is enough of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs arcane abstinence-only agenda. Keeping women in the dark about their reproductive health violates their human rights. #HandsOffOurBodies https://t.co/JUBEcxIXx8Envigorated by the strength of my firey and resilient colleagues. As women in Congress, we stand together, resisting bigotry, hate, and fear of the other. No child should EVER be ripped from the arms of their mother.

His response? "...the only thing the tax bill appears to have done is distributed several trillion dollars from working people to rich people." https://t.co/XJmaegOT2UCongress needs answers. 

The American public needs answers. 

These families NEED answers. https://t.co/OFb92fhRKIWhen asked where the girls and toddlers are being held, @SecNielsen didn‚Äôt know. Isn‚Äôt that her job? #WhereAreTheGirls?

The Trump administration cannot continue to be silent. We need answers. https://t.co/pflG1MdnBOIs it really, @SpeakerRyan? Because if the @harleydavidson worker in that picture was in the Kansas City plant, he's actually unemployed right now. His job moved to Thailand because of your #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/RnHuDkeRFk https://t.co/KRdF2iTHwxWhat's going to happen to the children who are stuck, alone, without their parents in detention centers scattered throughout the country? The psychological damage has already been done. This EO doesn't begin to solve the massive problem @realDonaldTrump has created.If @realDonaldTrump really believed that "anybody with a heart" would want to end family separation, then why'd it take him so long... This was HIS policy. He could have stopped this abuse with a phone call.The @GOP's #ACA sabotage continues to leave more people in Wisconsin uninsured as premiums soar. Now, their #BrighterForBillionaires budget REPEALS the ACA &amp; adds to the pain by cutting $2T from Medicare &amp; Medicaid. Another shameful piece of legislation from my @GOP colleagues... https://t.co/AlNzQaWqmtThe story of this country was written, in large part, by those fleeing oppression &amp; hardship. The White House needs to take a minute to reflect on our history &amp; remember that a strong nation builds bridges, not walls. #WorldRefugeeDay #RefugeesWelcome #WithRefugees https://t.co/Wk2nUKQXl3Family separation has been universally condemned by the child welfare community, immigration rights community, and medical professionals. I support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to prevent @DHSgov officials from separating children from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/qVQf8TxbsAMilwaukee has a rich tradition of elevating the song of emancipation to echo across the nation. #JuneteenthDay is more than a celebration of progress, it's a living memorial of our fight for liberation.

Congress must act to end @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs policy of family separation NOW. https://t.co/vz8fDnxyEe2 years ago today, a violent act of hatred took 49 vibrant lives from this world.

Every year more &amp; more families depend on women's income to keep food on the table, yet at the current rate, we won't see pay equity for 100 years. We need the #PaycheckFairnessAct b/c all families deserve financial security.53 yrs ago SCOTUS decided #GriswoldvCT, paving the way for a natl network of family planning clinics &amp; new opportunities for women &amp; children.

It's shameful the tragic deaths of Sylville Smith &amp; Dontre Hamilton &amp; the Stop &amp; Frisk lawsuit haven't inspired the necessary changes at the Milwaukee Police Department to end these ongoing policing failures. https://t.co/ZYBwZCd5tT500 days &amp; @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs biggest accomplishment is a #TaxScam that gives massive handouts to Wall Street, Big Pharma &amp; corporations, leaving American families in the dust saddled with soaring health costs, rising gas prices &amp; flat wages. We need #ABetterDeal.Today‚Äôs #SCOTUS decision reaffirms the immediate need for federal #LGBTQ nondiscrimination laws like the Equality Act.

Let us continue our fight for a future worthy of their sacrifice. https://t.co/i3rT0D5KcvWhile I am encouraged that Jack Johnson's legacy of standing up to systemic &amp; institutionalized racism has been rightfully restored, this pardon by @realDonaldTrump in no way makes up for the @WhiteHouse's overwhelmingly racist policies that leave Black Americans behind. https://t.co/C1W6OmjGW0The Milwaukee Police Department should make this suspension permanent. The officer in question demonstrated a lack of judgment and of candor. It's a misnomer that tasers are a non-leathal force. https://t.co/Dh1GBmq7A8Enough is enough of this culture that allows violence by rogue officers and erodes public trust in our justice system. The time for excuses is long past. Milwaukee needs action and reform.

‚ùåThis bill is bad for farmers, consumers &amp; communities.64 years ago, #SCOTUS decided the landmark civil rights case #BrownvBoard.

We must #protectSNAP from @GOP cuts. https://t.co/K3OtuegEcXToday, I testified on behalf of FY19 funding for #VAWA &amp; #VOCA. These laws have fueled undeniable progress towards addressing #domesticviolence. Funding cuts would erode protections and endanger essential services that help survivors escape from violence rebuild their lives. https://t.co/JbzSEdnQj3#TaxDay is yet another harsh reminder that 86 million middle-class families will see their taxes go up because of the #GOPTaxScam, while the wealthiest Americans, @GOP donors, and corporations get huge tax breaks. https://t.co/8yKkq3PD8jProud to announce the new Bipartisan Working Group to End Domestic Violence.

‚Üí TODAY @ 1:30pm CT https://t.co/sOc6baND4xScooter Libby lied to investigators &amp; obstructed justice while working in the White House. @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs pardon is a blatant attempt at witness tampering in the Mueller probe &amp; yet another example of obstruction by the @WhiteHouse. https://t.co/FqpYGOcATPBlack babies in #Wisconsin die at higher rates than any other US state.

Millions of Americans enrolled in these programs work 2+ jobs just to keep food on the table for their families. We need a living wage, not more requirements. https://t.co/aA7Zj2b1HdThe "balanced budget amendment" is nothing short of radical @HouseGOP-led propaganda that forces hard-working Americans to pay for the #GOPTaxScam's $1.8 trillion deficit by decimating Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security. https://t.co/NJNa4I6k1U.@SpeakerRyan &amp; I served together on the Budget Committee for nearly a decade &amp; shared countless flights to &amp; from Wisconsin.

The American people deserve to know the facts. https://t.co/tPBpDdNa2GThe facts are in, the #TrumpTaxScam explodes the deficit, and the @GOP is hell-bent on forcing American families to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% by passing the Balanced Budget Amendment, which would decimate Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security. https://t.co/Lgr5aTHUNQWhen my dad went on strike at his Racine factory job, he told me to go get an education bc union jobs like his wouldn't exist for long.

My love to her family.In the face of @realDonaldTrump's intolerance &amp; in a world that all too often tells trans people, particularly trans women of color, that they shouldn't exist, it is imperative that we lift up the stories &amp; lives of all transgender people. #TransgenderDayOfVisibiliyThe passover tradition is based in overcoming persecution &amp; defending the vulnerable.

It's high time @GOP find the same moral clarity &amp; courage as these young Americans. #NationalSchoolWalkout https://t.co/tEL6pxlDh9Now that @realDonaldTrump's #GOPTaxScam has been signed into law, we can clearly see that corporate shareholders ‚Äî not workers ‚Äî are reaping the rewards. Get ready for Republicans to use the debt they're creating to justify gutting our #SocialSafetyNet. https://t.co/9yQDlfA7zrToo many US cities have lead-poisoning rates at &amp; above Flint's, including #Milwaukee. 

How do #TrumpBudget &amp; #InfrastructureScam help? 

They don‚Äôt.

@realDonaldTrump is cutting @EPA funding &amp; gutting clean water programs that protect our communities. https://t.co/XvIR3v9SMSThank you, @mwestramke. My staff and I are working hard to make this country a safer place for all of us. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/YOFRM3oXFXThanks for dropping by, @rizahmad! https://t.co/q8D7Tmli5KAmericans are sick &amp; tired of the ‚Äúthoughts &amp; prayers‚Äù statements from those who line their pockets with @NRA üí∞.

Enough with these empty sentiments. We need action to #EndGunViolence &amp; nothing less.

Thanks to @MSNBC‚Äôs @SRuhle for putting all of this into perspective for us. https://t.co/WilhrYcFpSThe kids are all right. https://t.co/ymHR9bERYAWords are meaningless without action and courage to back it up, @jeffsessions.

With your track record of unequivocal support for the @NRA, I have my doubts... https://t.co/Ww7OfikRubToday marks the 18th school shooting in America this year. 

And it‚Äôs only February... 

How many more students have to die before my colleagues across the aisle find the fortitude to stand up to the @NRA?

@MomsDemand @BradyCenter @Everytown #EndGunViolence #GunControlNowWill all of y‚Äôall be my valentine? https://t.co/H0OV5vQ23ZBelieve it, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/b7j1HUaLWEWe always hear the @GOP talk about policies that "get people back to work."

If you truly care about Americans, listen to them! #HandsOff our #SocialSafetyNet! https://t.co/c8YMfwIOAaIn order to pay for massive #TaxCuts for the top 1%, #TrumpBudget proposes crippling funding cuts for programs like #Medicaid that vulnerable American families rely on for survival.
 
@realDonaldTrump: 80% of Americans oppose Medicaid cuts. Please, listen to the people! #HandsOff https://t.co/BwsgXkS9XsProud to join anti-poverty, labor, civil rights, faith, and progressive leaders for a rally against Trump's budget cuts. #HandsOff https://t.co/2UaCgGi8X6This week, I joined @CarolHLN to talk about the disgraceful way @realDonaldTrump &amp; @WhiteHouse handled #DomesticViolence allegations against #RobPorter.

This alarming development raises even more questions about this administration's commitment to women. https://t.co/24kfa9NMJBIn 2015, I wrote a @GuardianUS piece about how poor Americans have become targets of punishing policies robbing them of their dignity.

As I continue to investigate this matter, I hope @SocialSecurity will swiftly open another branch in the area. https://t.co/SQe7vRa1DcThe @realDonaldTrump administration just proposed a budget with devastating cuts to #Medicare, #Medicaid, #SNAP &amp; other critical social programs.

So much to be proud of. @OfficialCBC https://t.co/oPUlAfxk6TAs I contemplated how to cast my vote today, I thought of the strength/courage of Wisconsin's #DREAMers. In the face of hateful @GOP opposition, they remain resolute. They're undocumented and unafraid. And as long as I'm in Congress I'll make sure they're not alone in this fight. https://t.co/Bmkd49y9aNStay safe out there, friends! https://t.co/WW3AIcPpA8It was my great honor to join my friend and colleague @NancyPelosi on the House floor today. 

We call on @SpeakerRyan to reject @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs anti-immigrant agenda and find the moral clarity to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/PwvFJr0lNb6 hours later and @NancyPelosi is still going strong. üí™üèæ

Take note, @realDonaldTrump: THIS is what true leadership looks like. 

#ProtectDREAMers https://t.co/o5jD7hLzJfHIV diagnoses among African Americans fell 8% from 2011 to 2015. We've made progress but the fight is not over.

"The way @SpeakerRyan is headed, history offers two possible verdicts: Either he enabled an autocrat, or he was intimidated by a fool," wrote @MJGerson, adding "the greatest source of cynicism" is "good people who lose their way." https://t.co/Rlxd4MWWFELater today in our @FinancialCmte hearing, I‚Äôll be asking the #ForeclosureKing himself, @stevenmnuchin1, why the @realDonaldTrump administration refuses to impose bipartisan sanctions on Russia (that passed the House 419-3 and Senate 98-2) for meddling in the 2016 election. https://t.co/MVt1UmsxpsFinally, something @EPAScottPruitt and I can agree on.

5) #NunesHoax was pure propaganda w/ as much credibility as @RT_com or @SarahHuckabee behind the podium.

6) All of this was a complete waste of time &amp; valuable resources.#NunesMemo takeaways:

1) Riddled w/ deceptive claims meant to undermine our institutions &amp; impede the Trump/Russia investigation.

2) Confirms Russian agents colluded w/ @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs campaign. 

3) @HouseGOP handpicked excerpts for far-right media to help them vilify @FBI.On @tmj4‚Äôs #414ward, I sat down with @CharlesBenson4 &amp; @ssimsworldwide to discuss my concerns over @SpeakerRyan's assault on our country's vital #SocialSafetyNet &amp; the need for Congress to reject @realDonaldTrump's anti-immigrant agenda. #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/IgMMo6URbNYesterday, I joined @AliVelshi on @MSNBC to talk about @realDonaldTrump's first #SOTU as well as my opinion piece for @NBCNewsTHINK on how the president's transgressions have done more to unify our country than any policy the administration has championed. https://t.co/7IkpS53eTWMy thoughts on tonight‚Äôs #SOTU:

The state of our union is indeed strong, as are the people who call it home. And despite what my Democratic colleagues might think, I do believe @realDonaldTrump deserves credit as well, just not for the reasons he thinks. https://t.co/e3lmwISUTXAnother #SOTU fact-check:

States like Ohio, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Wyoming, Indiana, New Mexico &amp; Texas actually lost coal jobs. 

You know what industry is growing? #CleanEnergy 

https://t.co/0sHqQyJbLTIt's true, the African American unemployment rate is a historic low, but that's thanks to @BarackObama not @realDonaldTrump.   

#SOTU fact check: Rates have been falling steadily since 2010.

https://t.co/fzYPR3dtA1It was an absolute pleasure to meet @Chessy_Prout. She‚Äôs paving the way for a new generation of #sheroes. I have no doubt that she has a bright future ahead of her.

Looks like Putin got what he paid for... https://t.co/KCTmtTwaIb#Healthcare is a human right that our government shouldn't restrict/make conditional. Denying coverage to those eligible for #Medicaid only blocks access to vital health services &amp; puts lives at risk.
