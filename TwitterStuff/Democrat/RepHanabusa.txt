It‚Äôs an important group of meetings that connects our local businesses with federal policy makers. Have a great day! https://t.co/TRtvfFaoklRemember, we are technically not at peace with Korea, there is an armistice in place. The details of this agreement are critical to defining the way forward and only time will tell. #NorthKoreaI was concerned the President was going to go there and sign a peace treaty and make a show of it. That would have put us in a precarious position because it would have paved the legal pathway for the removal of U.S. troops from South Korea.United States. All the experts in attendance, including the delegation from China, were unanimous in their belief that peace and diplomatic relations could not be restored if the leaders of United States and North Korea could not meet and speak.including former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Christopher Hill and Sue Mi Terry, a former North Korea analyst for the CIA. Ambassador Hill attended the six-party talks that occurred intermittenly starting in 2003 between China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, and theIn March, I had the privilege of  attending the Aspen Institute‚Äôs Congressional Program titled ‚ÄúFinding a Diplomatic Solution to the North Korea Crisis‚Äù at Stanford University. The conference featured three days of round table discussions with scholars, soldiers, and diplomats,It is also concerning that there was almost no mention of North Korea‚Äôs atrocious human rights records and whether it would be a condition required in any agreement.It will take significant negotiations and diplomatic maneuvering to define the details of this vague agreement. How will we enforce it?My hope is that this meeting is not the end, rather the beginning of a means to the end. We must remember the two individuals leading these negotiations. They both have a history of backing out of big deals and making false promises.The two leaders agreed ‚Äúto build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula‚Äù and ‚Äúthe DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.‚Äù They put that in writing.For Hawaii, this should assuage fears of a possible nuclear attack from North Korea. My belief has always been that our greatest nuclear adversary remains Russia. There is no doubt that this is a historic moment in the relationship between the countries and the region #NorthKoreaHave a safe and enjoyable King Kamehameha Day. https://t.co/FKSQt4hTgDYes, I did! #NetNeutrality https://t.co/U2A7OXovvzWe had a wonderful, local-style Sunday in DC!

They did not, in anyway, reverse the progress we have made to protect and advance the innate rights of our #LGBTQ community.The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling is an unfortunate start to LGBTQ #PrideMonth and a reminder that we have a lot of work ahead of us. Every person is free to be exactly who they are and to love who they love.Seeking asylum in is not illegal, in fact, it is written into US laws to ensure that those with a credible fear of persecution can present their case.

America is a nation of immigrants, defined by our diversity and we are stronger because of it.We must never forget the injustice of Japanese internment.

We cannot allow racial stereotyping to be a part of policy making, ever again..@SecretaryZinke continues to miss the point. This is racial stereotyping.

Ironic that they Target Title X, a bipartisan program signed into law by then President Richard Nixon. I urge my colleagues to act to ensure #NoGagRuleTitle X serves more than 4 million patients a year. Under the Trump/Pence rule, patients will be denied complete &amp; accurate information about their reproductive healthcare options. It also prohibits providers from referring patients for safe, legal abortion services. #NoGagRuleTitle X is the only federal program exclusively dedicated to family planning and reproductive-health services. @realDonaldTrump's @GOP issued a rule designed to undermine a program that primarily helps the uninsured, low-income Americans and young people. #NoGagRuleNearly 1-in-5 teachers in America need to have a second job to provide for their families.

Under the War Powers Act, he should have come to Congress to seek authorization.The use of chemical weapons is a heinous violation of international law and should be dealt with by the international community. However, Syria is not within the purview of the current Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).Frannie is no longer an only child. Sorry sistah. This is Li ªi.

Tune in! https://t.co/Bc6K7BfJyQWe stand with the next generation of America‚Äôs leaders and everyone who turned out all over the world today to demand an end to gun violence. Congress must pass bipartisan legislation to keep our communities safe. #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/CGHTCZEyKiIt‚Äôs been 8 years since the Affordable Care Act became law. The result ‚Äì historically low uninsured rate. #ProtectOurCareHopefully, it is a signal that Congress is willing to work together in the best interest of the American people when the Trump administration refuses to do so. https://t.co/S4po2hOG7WThis spending package represents a bipartisan rebuke of the Trump administration‚Äôs stated budget priorities. Many of the issues and proposals that Democrats pushed back on are not included in this bill. https://t.co/S4po2hOG7WWe were able to reach a consensus on spending increases to critical programs that address homelessness, increase access to affordable housing, support working families, repair infrastructure and bolster our national defense. https://t.co/S4po2hOG7WWhile I would prefer funding the government through the regular appropriations process, this is a good, bipartisan bill for Hawaii and our nation. https://t.co/S4po2hOG7WThank you to the students and teachers from Mililani Mauka! They asked great questions about arming teachers, the Honolulu rail project, what‚Äôs up with the President and other topics.

https://t.co/aQQOwDIOKiPlease contact @SecretaryZinke and urge him to restore funding for the Japanese American Confinement Sites (JACS) grant program (Public Law 109-441, 120 Stat. 3288) :

Please Call -- (202) 208-3100 and press 3 to reach Secretary Zinke's OfficeRemember so it is never repeated.  I call upon you to join in the fight to ensure this country never forgets that it imprisoned its people because of their ancestry, not because they committed a crime.How ironic that the most decorated unit in military history, the 100th battalion, 442 Regimental Combat Team, fought for a country that considered them enemy aliens. We must never forget our voices or the fact that we must fight so all can remember the injustice.When @SecretaryZinke chose to address me in Japanese (when no one else was greeted in their ancestral language), I understood ‚Äòthis is precisely why Japanese Americans were treated as they were more than 75 years ago. It is racial stereotyping.These programs tell the horrific stories of 120,000 Japanese American men, women and children, including my grandfathers, who were arrested and imprisoned during World War II.Last year 23 organizations in seven states received JACS funding totaling $2,869,500 to create curriculum, build infrastructure and finance programs, some at former internment sites like Honouliuli and Sante Fe, New Mexico.The real issue here is that the administration ignored one of the most racially motivated periods in American history by defunding the Japanese American Confinement Sites (JACS) grant program. https://t.co/Z2YeqMF3L6Let us all keep @louiseslaughter's family and loved ones in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time..@louiseslaughter's committee met at all hours, most not normal. Yet when I had amendments or other business she always greeted me with a smile and fought for my bills. She was a real fighter and a true role model. We are better lawmakers and people because of her. Mahalo, LouiseMahalo to Hawaii‚Äôs representatives attending the Federal Manager‚Äôs Association‚Äôs 80th National Convention &amp; Management Training Seminar. Thank you for the work you do to support our government. https://t.co/ZWiW9MFO4SMahalo to the @CloseUp_DC students from Kauai High School for talking story this afternoon. We enjoyed discussing taro farming, shearwaters, the environment and why Washington ‚Äúworks‚Äù the way it does. Our MLA, Dan Kouchi, is Kauai High class of 2008! https://t.co/cYveWudgPzOn Sunday, my friend @RepMarcyKaptur will become the longest serving woman in the history of the House. She took office in January 1983 and has fought for her constituents with honor and integrity. Mahalo, Marcy, for your inspiring service.Congratulations to @Iolani_School 's Davey Huang, who took home $25,000 as a finalist in the @regeneron Science Talent Search. Davey developed software to detect genetic disorders before in-vitro fertilization. Our staff member &amp; fellow @Iolani_Raiders @kenbenc joined us. https://t.co/u0EV7MMks8The next generation of America's leaders are united on this issue. We should be too. We have to listen and fight for bipartisan legislation to keep America's kids safe and help end gun violence. Our schools must be safe havens for students to learn and grow. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/y1ce3eK0p1The President gave false hope to Stoneman Douglas and all gun violence survivors before he returned to his NRA talking points. How much longer will @SpeakerRyan refuse to take action to #EndGunViolence? #Enough #NeverAgain https://t.co/qjNEpgMCLhIt is very sad, although not surprising, that Trump looks recent gun violence survivors in the eye, promises change, then sides with the NRA. #NeverAgain #EndGunViolence
