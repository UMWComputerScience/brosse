I am deeply saddened by the tragic shooting in Annapolis. At least 5  fatalities reported. My prayers are with the families affected. Thank  you to the first responders who responded within a minute of the  shooting. Congress needs to step up and act!I was pleased to offer a number of amendments to the FY19 Defense Appropriations Act that were adopted with bipartisan support this week to direct millions of dollars to cybersecurity training and recruitment, and peer-reviewed breast cancer research. https://t.co/wvEkfKaYjFThe Supreme Court’s ruling in #Janus is an unprecedented attack on the rights of our country’s 17 million public employees. It ignores 41 years of legal precedent and overturns existing laws in 22 states and the District of Columbia for no apparent reason. #UnionStrong https://t.co/zdBTFzH0EVToday’s ruling by the Supreme Court is an endorsement of intolerance. The Muslim Ban is just as immoral, discriminatory, and un-American as the day it was first announced. https://t.co/FgE5xgvUOoIn 30 states, LGBTQ Americans can be fired, evicted, or denied other services. The Equality Act would change this and provide consistent non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans nationwide. #EqualityForward https://t.co/2CGiHHu0MVThree years ago today, SCOTUS affirmed every American the right to marry the person they love. We cannot allow victories like this to be eroded, and must continue to defend LGBTQ+ rights. So much is still at stake. #LoveWinsSince the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v.

Every American must be guaranteed a voice in our democracy – we must #RestoreTheVOTE13 states have multiple voting rights violations over the past 25 years – the Voting Rights Advancement Act would ensure that they don’t enact any more election changes which are unfair to voters #RestoreTheVOTEVoting is not a use-it-or-lose-it-right. But 5 years after Shelby County v. Holder, anti-voter politicians are using tactics like voter purges to take eligible voters off the voter rolls.

Last night, House Republicans blocked my amendment protecting long-term TPS holders from being considered. https://t.co/PW4t2X6zdnI was pleased to host the 2018 Black and Jewish Members of Congress this  morning.

We must address these challenges together https://t.co/EpdyWpyxH5 https://t.co/qR60Sto5H2Last night in the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for certain long-term TPS holders. Not surprisingly in this historically closed Congress, my amendment was not made in order. https://t.co/D29GD4ZRf9Nearly 1.7 million children live in homes with a loaded, unlocked gun. Unsecured firearms inadvertently injure thousands of kids in homes ever year. Before letting your child go to a friend’s house to play, remember to ask if there is an unlocked gun in the house. #NationalASKDayThank you @JGreenblattADL for your poignant thoughts at this morning's Black and Jewish Members of Congress Breakfast. Our communities must work together to combat Antisemitism, prejudice, and racism in every form. https://t.co/e37SUJLt16Thank you @ADLWashCounsel for joining our important conversation today on the state of Black and Jewish Relations in America.

No law requires this, just @DHSGov policy with @RealDonaldTrump’s blessing. Every day that goes by without ending #FamilySeparation is a betrayal of our values.It is absurd that Congress needs to act to stop @RealDonaldTrump’s child  separation policy. The President implemented it and can end it any time he wants, but he is using children as political bargaining chips. The  soul of our nation is at stake. #KeepFamiliesTogetherActInstead, he has repeatedly said that Democrats need to come to the table and then actively shut us out.  If he continues to lack the courage to act, we should lock ourselves in this building until we override his government sanctioned child abuse policies, forever. (2/2)The President’s abhorrent immigration policies are under attack – as they should be – and so he is refusing to own them. I resent Donald Trump casting blame on others for his own moral failures.

Photos by: Mark James https://t.co/LdCNGSoyKPLet’s be clear – this policy comes directly from the President’s Administration. No matter how he tries to cast blame on others, Donald Trump can end this policy himself. Every day that goes by without ending #FamilySeparation is a betrayal of American values.Separating children from their families and holding them in cages is  government-sanctioned child abuse. I don’t care where you come from; no  family deserves to be treated this way. Shame on Donald Trump for  permitting such an immoral, indefensible policy.When you cite a verse of the bible used to defend slavery to justify separating families and sticking children in cages, it means that your policy is morally bankrupt. America will be judged for this shameful episode. https://t.co/yNkUy9w2flIt is outrageous that the Republican Congress has embraced the President’s draconian immigration policies.

Rather, the Speaker is maneuvering to avoid an open debate. #DREAMERs deserve better. Congress is broken, and the Republicans broke it.This absurd resolution will only deepen divisions and make peace more elusive. It does nothing for the Palestinian people. The UN should re-affirm Israel's right to defend itself, reject terror-financed propaganda, and work to disarm Hamas. It is that simple. https://t.co/RY2MYX4VzlI reject @RealDonaldTrump’s heartless decisions to separate families and bar asylum to the most vulnerable victims of domestic and gang violence.

This closed process is absolutely shameful and no way to govern. #GOPClosedCongressOpen rules allow every Member of Congress, regardless of their party affiliation or political ideology, to take part in the legislative process. Every Member should have a voice. This is after all the “People's House” &amp; all Members should be allowed to participate in the process.@HouseGOP broke its own “closed-rule” record yesterday. Under Republican leadership, the 115th session of the House of Representatives is officially the most closed off Congress in history. #GOPClosedCongressI am pleased to congratulate Ellen Kranzler for being recognized by Volunteer Florida’s #VF30in30 campaign. Ellen's commitment to Speak Up For Kids over the past 10 years is truly admirable. Thank you for all the work you have done for the children in Palm Beach County!Two of the bills (DREAM Act &amp; USA Act) would give permanent legal status to DREAMERs.

But rather than working together to make it stronger and better, House Republicans have only worked to undermine it or repeal it without an alternative. 70 votes have been taken to gut the ACA, driving up costs for taxpayers &amp; consumers. #ProtectOurCareThe #ACA also provides key preventive health services—such as flu shots, cancer screenings, and birth control—at no cost to Americans with insurance. #ProtectOurCareThe Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against Americans with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. Any effort to sabotage the ACA jeopardizes these protections. #ProtectOurCareEight years ago today, President @BarackObama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. The @HouseGOP has been on a mission to sabotage it ever since. #ProtectOurcareThe FY18 omnibus included $190M for a new federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale. I have been working with my Broward County colleagues for many years to secure this funding. It is a huge win for our community!I am absolutely heartbroken at the passing of my dear friend, Rep. Louise Slaughter.  She served her constituents and our nation with honor and distinction.  I offer my deepest condolences to her family, friends, constituents, and staff during this extremely difficult time.My prayers are with the families of those lost and injured in this tragic accident.  I thank all those who rushed to the scene to help. https://t.co/eunjoAA3FfToday is the 7th anniversary of the Syrian Civil War, and the international community has done nothing to stop the violence. This week, more than 500 people have been killed in Syria, nearly half of whom were children. The need for immediate and strong action remains. https://t.co/Kc0g8bMn88During Music in Our Schools Month we recognize the contributions made by music education programs to our nation’s students and youth. I’m proud to support the many schools and organizations in my district and across the country that promote music education and the arts. #MIOSMThank you @RepTedDeutch for organizing today’s meeting with Marjory Stoneman Douglas students to discuss meaningful and commonsense gun control reform. I am inspired by and proud of these students who are leading the charge for responsible gun laws. #MSDStrong https://t.co/dNc1txjgR3I just sent a letter to the Florida State Legislature urging them to repeal the firearm preemption law so that local communities can implement sensible gun control measures. https://t.co/A1MlM5Tp4GThis week, I joined @davidcicilline and 150 of my Colleagues in re-introducing the assault weapons ban in the House of Representatives. These weapons are made for the battlefield, and they have no place in our society.Labor unions are an integral part of the American workforce and have helped workers improve their wages, workplace rights, safety, and stability. The Supreme Court must affirm this right. #JanusvAFSCME.Tonight, I am again calling for the swift passage of gun safety legislation so no community knows this pain again. #ParklandTownHall #StudentsDemandAction #StonemanDouglasI demand that @POTUS takes decisive action to get guns off our streets. Democrats in Congress have tried and been blocked by Republicans, time and time again. This cannot be allowed to continue. #StonemanDouglas #ParklandTownHall #StudentsDemandActionJust a reminder for everyone paying attention, the only bill related to gun-violence that @RealDonaldTrump has signed into law removed restrictions meant to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill people. H.J.Res.40, signed into law 2/28/17. Look it up. #ParklandTownHallThe stranglehold of the gun lobby has gone on long enough. They have divided our country and washed their hands of responsibility. I am proud of my lifetime F rating and will continue to advocate day and night for common sense gun reforms.While we focus on the tragic loss of 17 innocent individuals, we must not lose sight of the fact that there will be nearly 35k gun deaths this year in America. This national conversation is long, long overdue. #StonemanDouglas #ParklandTownHallKnowing how to use a gun should not be a pre-requisite for teaching, whether it is kindergarten or high school chemistry. @RealDonaldTrump: if this is your best idea for stopping this crisis, you need to start listening for a change. #StonemanDouglas #ParklandTownHall https://t.co/zoxaVsR37FThere have been 18 school shootings since the start of the year. This is not normal. This is not natural. This is not, and can never be, the cost of living in America. #StonemanDouglas #ParklandTownHall #StudentsDemandAction#StonemanDouglas shooting survivors will speak to the nation tonight on @CNN. I encourage everyone to tune in at 9PM and hear their stories and their words. #ParklandTownHall #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/4Blf3Qysr1Our worst fears have been realized, and our community has been left shattered. The lives of 17 innocent individuals have been ripped away from us in a cowardly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. I am heartbroken tonight and without words. https://t.co/KsR3CD1sh0Update: The suspected shooter has been taken into custody.We are the only nation that suffers this type of violence on a nearly daily basis. Something needs to change!First responders are on the scene at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, but the shooter is still at-large. For the latest updates, follow @browardsheriff.Our community has been shattered by another tragic and senseless act of violence. My prayers are with the victims and their families of this horrifying shooting.The #TrumpBudget shows the #GOPTaxScam for what it really is. Rather than producing surpluses as Republicans falsely claimed, the WH’s own math shows that it will add trillions to the debt.The #TrumpBudget is such a joke it’s barely worth commenting on. It cuts Social Security to pay for the border wall with Mexico. It includes a $250 billion cut to #Medicaid and $214 billion in cuts to food assistance – and it still results in $7 trillion of new deficit spending.The President’s infrastructure plan, which provides $200 billion in direct investment over a decade, also cuts $206 billion from existing infrastructure programs. America deserves a #BetterDeal, not the President’s nonsensical joke of a plan.After ramming through a $1.5 trillion deficit-exploding #GOPTaxScam, @RealDonaldTrump’s infrastructure plan urges states to increase property taxes, sales taxes, and tolls to pay for infrastructure investments. The Democratic #BetterDeal plan proposes 5x more direct investment.The President released the flawed #NunesMemo over the objections of the FBI and the DOJ because he thought it would help him. He blocked the Democratic Memo because he knows it will hurt him. @RealDonaldTrump: Americans deserve the truth. Stop politicizing national security.Thank you @RandiKayeCNN &amp; @HLNTV for your report on the Dog Meat Trade in the USA. (Watch it here: https://t.co/xtDYx1qDEX) I continue to urge @HouseGOP to bring my legislation banning the trade (H.R.1406) and condemning the practice globally (H.Res.401) to the floor for a vote.HIV diagnoses among African American women fell 20% from 2011 to 2015. We’ve made incredible progress, but we must not waiver in the fight to end new infections and provide better care for those living with this disease. #NBHAAD #EndAIDS2030 https://t.co/o7yN1InuV9 https://t.co/yYkz91FGmOLess than a week after the SOTU @RealDonaldTrump is back to name-calling on Twitter. If the President put this much effort into responsible budgeting or bipartisan immigration reform, we might actually get something done around here. https://t.co/2KhNeD9xjrOnly 15 percent of workers have access to paid family leave. Not having a national paid leave policy hurts workers and results in higher job turnover, lost wages, and billions in lost economic benefits. As we mark #FMLA25, it’s time for Congress to enact a #PaidLeave standard.Republicans just released the Nunes Memo, ignoring warnings from the FBI and Department of Justice that doing so will endanger national security. As the former Vice Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, I am outraged by this reckless decision. https://t.co/P0MHyPFTl3Last week, my colleagues @RepBrianMast, @RepLoisFrankel, and I attended the official ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the shared-space agreement at the @VAWestPalmBeach https://t.co/hxVz3Swph2My thoughts are with my @GOP colleagues, their families, and staff.  I was very saddened to learn there was a fatality in today’s tragic Amtrak collision.  I wish those injured a speedy recovery.One evening of faux-bipartisanship does not erase the President’s failures over the past year. The President’s policies speak for themselves, and I do not believe for one second that the coming year will be any different. #SOTU https://t.co/biQpIkb5rY@RealDonaldTrump’s first Muslim Ban, enacted one year ago today and just one week into his Presidency, was a shameful &amp; discriminatory policy grounded in fear rather than fact. I call on the Administration to resume the processing of refugees immediately.The President’s so-called immigration proposal is absolutely shameful. It is a ransom demand, plain and simple. My full statement: https://t.co/eijVfljzCRThere have been 11 school shootings this year. It’s January 24th. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. #HonorWithAction #EndGunViolenceOne year ago, President Trump reinstated and expanded the #GlobalGagRule. The rule continues to prevent women in developing countries from receiving life-saving healthcare like HIV treatment &amp; cancer screenings. Congress must pass H.R.671, the Global HER Act!I am pleased to announce the official ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the shared-space agreement at the VAMC-WPB will take place this Friday, with @RepTedDeutch, @RepLoisFrankel, and @RepBrianMast For more details: https://t.co/4BpI3zL0AQWe are just 4 months into the fiscal year, yet the Republican-run Congress has needed 4 short-term funding bills to keep the government running. It is absolutely shameful that Congress has kicked the can down the road again. #TrumpShutdown My statement: https://t.co/4JD1PuxxrkRussian meddling didn’t stop with the election. We need to address it, and to stop playing politics with national security. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/YsfSYyL5FuYesterday, Democrats offered 10 separate motions in the House to end the #GovernmentShutdown. Republicans blocked every one of them. The Republicans are making it clear: they prefer a shutdown to a bipartisan deal. Shame on them! #TrumpShutdown@RealDonaldTrump: You are the President. Act like it. Tell your staff you want a compromise to end the #GovernmentShutdown. Don’t walk away from a deal just because fringe members of your staff want to keep the #TrumpShutdown going. https://t.co/5ozqKiwMYOA bipartisan group of 20 Senators are making progress on a deal to end the #TrumpShutdown. House Republicans, without even seeing the deal, said they won't support it. "My way or the highway" won't cut it.America is an idea, with ideals and values. We don’t exclude people. But that’s what this CR does. It includes nothing for jobs or pensions. It doesn’t provide the resources my district needs. Long before the #GovernmentShutdown, people were shut out. It must stop! https://t.co/5LBRGGGpetAn entire segment of Congress was given ZERO input on this CR. That's just not right. I've been here 25 years, and can tell you it gets us nowhere. It needs to stop! #TrumpShutdown#TrumpShutdown Fact: This is the 2nd GOP Shutdown in 5 years. It’s the fifth time the GOP has shut down the government in 30 years. It’s the first shutdown in modern history when one party held the House, Senate and White House.#TrumpShutdown Fact: Parts of Puerto Rico are still without power 4 months after Hurricane Maria. It’s unclear how ongoing FEMA recovery efforts in Texas, Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands will be impacted.#TrumpShutdown Fact: During a government shutdown, recipients will continue to receive their Social Security and SSI checks. No new Social Security Cards will be issued, impacting 60k people daily.#TrumpShutdown Fact: The GOP held the CHIP program hostage (a version that cost $6 billion more than it should have). The program expired 112 days ago. If they were serious about protecting children, they could have voted for it 111 days ago. Or 110 days ago. Or 109, 108… etc.#TrumpShutdown Fact: During a shutdown, the Small Business Administration stops approving small business loans and guarantees ($1 billion per month). During the 2013 shutdown, the SBA couldn’t process 700 applications for $140 million in loans.#TrumpShutdown Fact: During the shutdown, the VA will cease reducing the backlog of Veterans disability claims. However, all VA medical facilities and clinics will remain open and operational. Call centers and hotlines will not be available.#TrumpShutdown Fact: Approximately 2/3rds of CDC and 3/4ths of NIH employees will be furloughed. We will lose valuable research and be unable to monitor the spread of contagious diseases. The FDA will cease the majority of its food safety activities.#TrumpShutdown Fact: The IRS is required to implement the GOP tax plan that was pushed through Congress last year. It’s complicated, and lots of my constituents have questions. The GOP just sent home nearly 60 percent of the IRS' workforce, adding delays and confusion.#TrumpShutdown Fact: 8,500 CDC employees will be furloughed as a result of the shutdown. This will severely impact our ability to monitor and treat the flu, which is particularly severe this year. We risk a number of supply shortages, including antiviral supplies.The House Rules Committee is meeting right now to give same-day authority to whatever deal gets made to reopen the government. Still no word on when the GOP will compromise. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/V39Ufz6bFL#TrumpShutdown Fact: The 16-day government shutdown in 2013 caused about 120,000 fewer private sector jobs to be created, according to the Council of Economic Advisers.#TrumpShutdown Fact: According to S&amp;P Global analysts, the shutdown will cost the economy about $6.5 billion per week. This is approximately 0.2 percent of gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter of 2017.#TrumpShutdown Fact: The shutdown in 2013 cost our government a combined total of 6.6 million work days.#TrumpShutdown Fact: Roughly 850,000 people will be furloughed as a direct result of the government shutdown. It will take an act of Congress, signed by the President, for them to get their pay back.#TrumpShutdown Fact: The President walked away from a bipartisan deal. The GOP froze democrats out of the process. This Administration has leapt from one controversy to another, throwing our government into complete disarray. This shutdown is on them.We are now in the 2nd GOP government shutdown in 5 years. Despite controlling the WH, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, President Trump’s Republican Party can’t even meet the most basic requirements of governing. #TrumpShutdown My statement: https://t.co/kFcRVHJWLgWomen must have access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare services.
