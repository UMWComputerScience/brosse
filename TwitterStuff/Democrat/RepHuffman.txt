Millions of dollars cut from background check system, plans to eliminate the School Safety Initiative &amp; bans on CDC researching gun violence... #EndGunViolenceA moment of silence won’t ease suffering in Parkland, FL. We need to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation so no community knows this pain again. #ParklandTownHall #StudentsDemandAction #EndGunViolenceGrateful to my friend @RepCarbajal for leading on this effort. It's one of many gun violence protection bills that deserves a hearing in Congress. Let's work to prevent future tragedies and #EndGunViolence
https://t.co/Us1JghspWOThis is exactly why I asked @TheJusticeDept to investigate Trump's hush money to Stormy Daniels https://t.co/ur6aHgYQBN.@TheJusticeDept needs to fully investigate @realDonaldTrump’s apparent violations of federal law &amp; hush money paid to Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence during the 2016 campaign. The cloud of secrecy needs to be lifted on this stormy situation. https://t.co/VbAviQ2nStMy heart goes out to the victims &amp; families in Parkland. In the face of unspeakable tragedy, if all Congress offers is silence, then we are disrespecting the victims. We need to finally break the hold that the gun lobby has over @HouseGOP to keep our kids safe. Enough is enoughOn this week’s episode of #OfftheCuff, I spoke with my #SOTU guest &amp; Veteran from Fort Bragg, Lynda Bengtsson-Davis, + @HRC advocate @SarahEMcBride about standing up to Trump’s anti-LGBTQ agenda. Tune in here! https://t.co/IQSi0XXJelI supported the bipartisan deal that provides budget certainty, disaster relief for CA, and stability for health centers &amp; other urgent priorities.

I'm grateful to my friend @RepSpeier for her tireless work on this &amp; I hope you will watch &amp; listen to my recent podcast conversation with her about this and much more.  https://t.co/Ug1v39eZUFThere are so many reasons why we need to save the DACA program from Donald Trump’s deadline, and protect these young immigrants who were brought to the country as children. I’ll give you one great example: Alex DeLeon. Watch her story here #saveDaca https://t.co/gg3aE3XVL3ICYMI: Our very own North Coast redwoods just topped Lonely Planet’s “Best in the U.S.” list.

https://t.co/nDHiT9ANQLYes, wouldn't want the President of the United States to make a reckless statement about something like a Super Bowl pick https://t.co/dLsqnjJJmk@LCStansberry @ncj_of_humboldt Thanks to you and your colleagues for digging into the broader question - good example of the importance of local investigative journalism, and good for all of us that this case happens to have a unique answer.Very disturbing that Members of Congress are recklessly endangering national security in order to enable Trump’s attempted obstruction of justice. We are a nation of laws, and nobody in this country, including the President, is above the law. https://t.co/clMkTLju1J.@ncj_of_humboldt deserves a rose for solving this mystery! https://t.co/mEoe2w7PjLALERT: Today is the last day to enroll in health insurance for 2018.

Along with @housegop leadership, he's been refusing to govern, and making sure this #trumpshutdown would last as long as possible. https://t.co/Gf5rqssyolToday, I am disgusted and dismayed that Republican congressional 'leaders' and President Trump have brought us to a government shutdown. Read my full statement on the #trumpshutdown here:  https://t.co/8CCfTHF4LKAnd this is exactly the problem: Republican negotiators are unwilling- or maybe genuinely unable– to address more than 1 of their self-created crises at a time. How about this: let’s keep gov open, protect Dreamers *and* fund children’s health insurance &amp; community health centers https://t.co/dJPO4coG8rYet another consequence of @HouseGOP decision to leave town without a bipartisan spending deal https://t.co/wbp7zNlNUrThere's no final spending plan, no long term CHIP funding, no DACA deal, but @HouseGOP plans to leave town, and @realDonaldTrump plans a party at mar a lago 🤔 https://t.co/4X4cCVQcLdWith time running out on keeping gov open, Trump first attacks his own chief of staff, then appears to realize that his GOP congressional allies have let the children’s health insurance program expire without a long-term solution. Where is the leadership? https://t.co/TbCVe2rRP6Doesn’t matter whether @realdonaldTrump called #Haiti + #African countries “shitholes” OR “shithouses” while negotiating immigration policy.  It’s not Presidential, it’s unbelievably un-American, and it’s undeniably racist. #CensureTrump #RootOutRacismWith his un-American rhetoric and refusal to protect #Dreamers, Trump seems to be pursuing a government shutdown despite unified GOP control of government. Listen to my #offthecuff podcast w. @RepGutierrez on why Congress must act to #SaveDACA now https://t.co/9Y4etrGf6nJust in: my latest #OfftheCuff episode with @RepSpeier is now live!

Tune into my weekly check-in with @KSRO’s The Drive below to find out! https://t.co/1K6RgBViyc.@realDonaldTrump just terminated legal protections for nearly 200,000 Salvadoran immigrants who have *legally* called America their home for decades, including hundreds of people in my district. This is an unacceptable attack on these families and on our communities #SaveTPSThe consequences of the rushed Trump-Ryan-McConnell #taxscam are still coming to light. Here’s the latest: it could actually encourage more companies to move their factories and jobs overseas.

Meanwhile, no time for a vote on a clean renewal of the children's health insurance program. https://t.co/yJ4OG86ZViI'm on the House floor now to vote against #GOPTaxScam because it hikes taxes on 86 million middle-class families, takes away health coverage from 13 mil Americans, and increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion. This is a bad deal for families on the North Coast &amp; across the countryLast week, I launched a regular series of #momentoftruth floor speeches cataloguing the #TrumpRussia connections &amp; the many ways the Trump presidency has been compromised.
