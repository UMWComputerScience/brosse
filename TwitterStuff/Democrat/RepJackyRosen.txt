Congratulations to this month‚Äôs #NevadaWomenInSTEM honoree @KristenAveryt!

We need to address this humanitarian crisis head on. That means reuniting families immediately and passing a bipartisan, comprehensive solution to fix our broken immigration system. We need action now. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThese children are not criminals. They're fleeing unimaginable violence in their home countries and looking for safety.At CBP, we saw immigrant families held in what looked very much like jail cells. Unaccompanied children are held in a bare, open space for days. This is where they eat, sleep, and wait to hear where they will be sent next. They are anxious and hopeless.In El Paso, I also toured a Customs and Border Protection processing center and holding facility where families seeking asylum and unaccompanied migrant children are held.The tent city looks more like a military installation in a foreign country than a place where children are cared for in the U.S.These children are being held in dusty tents. They are in an unfamiliar place and far from their families and friends. Their showers and bathrooms are outside in trailers. They‚Äôre given damp rags to protect their faces from the heat and dust.Seeing these minors alone without any idea what will happen next was disturbing. No child should have to live in these conditions.This week, I went to Texas and toured the Tornillo detention facility outside of El Paso. This is the site of the tent city holding unaccompanied immigrant children and children who have been separated from their parents.As a former union member, I understand the support that labor organizations bring to families. That‚Äôs why I'll continue fighting to ensure Nevada‚Äôs workers have the ability to advocate for themselves &amp; their union rights. #Union https://t.co/Jk7mh154hdSCOTUS‚Äô decision deals a major blow to our unions, who provide working Americans with a path to the middle class. Fair-share fees are necessary to support collective bargaining activities so that all workers can advocate for better wages &amp; safer working conditions.I sent a letter to House appropriators urging them to prevent federal dollars from being used to separate families entering the U.S. This Administration‚Äôs family separation policy has led to a humanitarian crisis. We must ensure this never happens again. https://t.co/cbdLxim7GQDeceiving women about their health care options is an attack on women's fundamental reproductive rights. #NIFLAvBecerra #ExposeFakeClinics

Now, the Trump Administration is moving to dismantle coverage protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. I will not stand for this. https://t.co/kdGRfGIikfDenying individuals entry to the U.S. based solely on religion or nationality is wrong and out of touch with our American values. This travel ban won‚Äôt help keep us safe, and I will continue to stand up against this Administration‚Äôs ignorant and xenophobic policies.I talked to a number of children seeking asylum at our border today.

We need immediate action to reunify families who have been separated under the Trump Administration's cruel immigration policy.Right now, children are crying for their parents and undergoing unimaginable trauma all because the President chose to implement a heartless policy that separated families. https://t.co/VWgWTOHh13Slashing our country‚Äôs legal immigration rates doesn‚Äôt just go against our American values -- it hurts our economy. https://t.co/h1CDPwzqHBAlzheimer‚Äôs impacts millions of American families.

Yet this Administration has chosen to implement this horrendous policy and deliberately ignore public outcry by refusing to put a stop to this madness. https://t.co/wXfJJhtRVERepublicans are once again trying to dismantle our health care system. Their plan could cause millions to lose coverage, weaken protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, and send premiums through the roof. https://t.co/xmBJJ2uowZToday marks a significant turning point in American history: the emancipation of the last enslaved African Americans in the United States. As we reflect on the progress we‚Äôve made, let us remember that the struggle for equality and justice is far from over. #Juneteenth https://t.co/aO83ZCVhU2No hay ninguna orden judicial en la ley que requiere que los agentes fronterizos separen ni√±os migrantes de sus padres, pero la administraci√≥n de Trump est√° jugando, ignorando la protesta p√∫blica y neg√°ndose a acabar con esta pol√≠tica atroz. https://t.co/5NJNEnvfVQMembers of Congress from both parties must act. I‚Äôm planning to co-sponsor a bill tonight to end the Trump Administration's brutal policy and #KeepFamiliesTogether.It‚Äôs shameful that some Republicans in Washington would rather use these kids as political pawns to push their own agenda instead of doing what‚Äôs right and true to our values as Americans to keep these families together.Innocent children who are being detained at the border, including babies and toddlers, are going through unthinkable trauma as a result of being separated from their parents. Hearing their cries breaks my heart. https://t.co/6RpjQJDmG5.There is no mandate in the law requiring border agents to separate migrant children from their parents, but the Trump Administration continues playing games, ignoring public outcry, and refusing to end this awful policy.ICYMI: The provisions from my bipartisan bill, which were signed into law this past week, will help Nevada veterans who have struggled with getting access to the quality health care they deserve. https://t.co/EPkuUbDI7CWest Las Vegas Library hosted a wonderful Juneteenth Celebration.

Stephen Del Bagno‚Äôs family and loved ones. Our community mourns with you and will always remember his valiant service to our country. https://t.co/obJFesEVNf.@EPAScottPruitt's mounting scandals make it impossible for him to lead the EPA. His anti-environmental agenda has been a disaster, and his ethical lapses are an insult to Nevada taxpayers. It's time for Pruitt to resign and be replaced by someone who can do this job effectively.I spoke at @lvchamber‚Äôs Eggs &amp; Issues breakfast today and announced my new bill aimed at creating tech startup R&amp;D jobs.

Este presidente fabric√≥ una crisis cuando acab√≥ con DACA, y ahora quiere desviar la culpa a quienes han trabajado para proteger nuestros so√±adores.Matthew received this year‚Äôs Citizens Honor award for his acts of courage and selflessness. He is a true hero. https://t.co/Xn4klZlyqhSix months after the #1October tragedy in Las Vegas, we cannot be thankful enough for the bravery of people like Matthew Cobos, who shielded &amp; provided life-saving medical treatment to concertgoers injured the shooting. https://t.co/FGr1pyyQoVSunday marked the 6-month anniversary of the #1October shooting. 1 Oct brought the kind of heartbreak &amp; tragedy we‚Äôve seen around the country to our own backyard. We'll continue to heal, but Congress can't keep failing to address the carnage caused by our gun violence epidemic.This is a shameful lie. This President manufactured a crisis when he ended DACA, and now he wants to shift the blame onto those who have been fighting to protect our Dreamers. https://t.co/ju860wofkuEsto solo es otro intento por la administraci√≥n de Trump de intimidar nuestras comunidades inmigrantes. El tener un censo preciso es importante, y tenemos que proteger la integridad del censo. #2020CensusThis is just another attempt by the Trump Administration to intimidate our immigrant communities.
