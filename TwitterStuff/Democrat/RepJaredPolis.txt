I am ready for that new day!It is absurd that @USAGSessions has broken @POTUS‚Äôs campaign promise &amp; is now waging war on legal #marijuana &amp; states‚Äô rights. I am calling on the President to overrule &amp; protect consumers, our economy, the will of voters, &amp; states‚Äô rights. #ColeMemo https://t.co/sQCL0yFkzvGood news here, but the President should have stated the actual reason for dissolving the commission - there is no credible evidence of massive voter fraud, and the commission was an attempt to disenfranchise voters.  #VoterSuppression  https://t.co/8E6gmier9LIf you clock-in &amp; out, you deserve a #fairwage that allows you to survive &amp; even get ahead. Coloradans voted to increase the #minimumwage to $12 by 2020, &amp; this week it moved to $10.20. The increase, while small, is a step toward making child-care &amp; rent more attainable for many.A record # of ppl have signed up for health insurance in this open enrollment period.

It‚Äôs always a joy talking to you, the people I serve.

It was terrible yesterday, it‚Äôs terrible today, &amp; it will be devastating when it is enacted. #GOPTaxScamRepublicans just passed their tax scheme, again; this time sending it to @POTUS for his signature. I voted "no" on the bill. I strongly support simplifying our tax code &amp; reducing rates, but the Republican tax scheme only plunges us deeper into debt &amp; hurts middle class families.BREAKING: Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a tax scheme that grows the national debt by over $1.5 trillion. It gives handouts to corporations &amp; special interests while plunging our nation deeper in debt &amp; hitting many middle class families w/ tax hikes.90,000: # of children &amp; pregnant women in Colorado who rely on #CHIP.

We must protect the internet as we know it, and save #NetNeutrality.This is not a drill. We cannot destroy the #ArcticRefuge by letting it become an oil field.
