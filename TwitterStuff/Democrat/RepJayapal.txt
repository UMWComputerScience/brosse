This is illegal: courts have ruled you cannot use detention as a deterrent. Illegal and inhumane. https://t.co/z25OoOdaYnYep, I paid my fine today for getting arrested with 575 women on Thursday. I will put my body on the line &amp; my feet in the streets and my voice loud and clear from Congress--we are fighting for the soul of our country and it takes all tactics! #EndZeroTolerance https://t.co/iUImrgLm9ZProud to be with these fierce women who, w/our amazing teams &amp; YOU the people, pulled off these incredible love-filled, determined rallies &amp; marches in all 50 states to demand an end to Trump's zero humanity policy. ‚Å¶@annagalland‚Å© ‚Å¶@aijenpoo‚Å© ‚Å¶@vanitaguptaCR‚Å© https://t.co/Ea5vYP61NpThis is beyond politics.

They're opposed to family incarceration too. They're hitting the streets with us on Saturday.

We should all want to let this inquiry run its course and to know the full facts surrounding possible collusion with the Russian government. https://t.co/erEMThLLakDonald Trump's so-called "zero tolerance" policy on immigration is a ZERO HUMANITY policy. 

We still need to reunite children with parents, keep them out of detention, and respect the legal right to seek asylum.

Great article. https://t.co/akfMZ9eJKo.@HouseGOP and @SpeakerRyan failed to include sexual orientation and gender identity in mandatory discrimination training for Congressmembers and staff, even though LGBTQ Americans face discrimination every day.

I went back to speak with the men who I had not been able to speak with last time, and to talk to the women again - so that I can continue to share their stories and get the truth out.I went inside the detention center again. Again, men and women broke down in tears speaking of their families, and they described fleeing terrible violence, rape and trauma. Nearly all want asylum. 

I promised we would keep fighting to defeat this cruelty and get them released. https://t.co/FdhE0TskibI'm going into the SeaTac federal detention center again to meet with immigrant women and men being held here. I will share what I learn when I come out. https://t.co/gwRxUC7hhdGreat discussion with @JoyAnnReid this morning getting to the root causes of what is really going on. Donald Trump and the GOP are deliberately whipping up fear and racism, harkening to some of the most shameful and disastrous episodes of the 20th century. https://t.co/chDj7PUtAjThis. This makes me hopeful that America can stand up to the stoking of fear and racism from the White House. Let's make June 30 a stand for who we really are! https://t.co/CcOpAyaGit https://t.co/qGcruXWeUbAbout to go live on MSNBC with @amjoyshow and @JoyAnnReid.

Tune in! #FamiliesBelongTogtherYes yes and yes. https://t.co/5ycIpOrudYI introduced a resolution after Charlottesville calling for the firing of Steven Bannon, Sebastian Gorka and Stephen Miller. The first two are gone. 

Miller, who backed the abusive policy of taking children from parents, has no place in the White House. https://t.co/FOOvZ0KDjKHe needs to go. https://t.co/5JfqsirzjRWe must end family separation and incarceration. My bill to establish humane and cost-effective alternatives to detention now has 95 House co-sponsors. 

Today, @SenBooker introduced the Senate version! I hope all of our colleagues will support it. https://t.co/Lg4DLDUrhA https://t.co/cL1T2eBuqoToday I spoke on the House floor to urge a vote on the Keep Families Together Act, sponsored by @RepJerryNadler, me and over 190 members to end Trump's cruel family separation policy. I also spoke to how 6193 would only make things words and deserves a NO vote. https://t.co/VBSLIrzQ12As I told Politico, I don‚Äôt think most Americans understand that a 33-year-old with connections to white supremacists is crafting policies that are going to literally destroy our country and what we stand for. Stephen Miller should be fired. He should not be in the White House. https://t.co/6oelioNa5Q@realDonaldTrump Your cruelty to asylum-seekers has nothing to do with security. Americans won't stand for it.

We'll vote for the Keep Families Together Act. You should tell your cabinet to reinstitute the Family Case Management Program which had a 99% success rate. https://t.co/IPoVYV0n2yMore setbacks for the GOP's disgraceful anti-immigrant agenda today. One bill was voted down, another withdrawn. 

When we organize, we win. https://t.co/s6jCpD8VyD@CICEROKID Family Case Management. It has a clear track record of success. https://t.co/XfIeuPPWXzDoes anyone really believe that the solution to separating children from their parents is INCARCERATING children with their parents? 

The only immigration bill we should be passing right now is the Keep Families Together Act. https://t.co/Sx8VFgPfIhAgain and again, we've seen courts strike down Trump policies that violate our values and the Constitution. 

I strongly support Attorney General Ferguson's efforts to hold this administration legally accountable for policies that inflict abuse on immigrant children and parents. https://t.co/JMLLeF4RwUDonald Trump's so-called "zero tolerance" policy, which remains in effect right now, is uniquely cruel to children and parents. 

I asked @elenibakst of @humanrights1st to explain the differences between these practices and the policies of past administrations. https://t.co/PK0KzFrcES.@NancyPelosi: We consider these children to be our children. 

You must not do harm to them in the name of the United States.

These policies are outside the circle of civilized human behavior.@RepJudyChu: 2,300 kids are out there with questionable chances of being able to reunite with their parents and they have already been traumatized..@RepRoybalAllard talks about a mother she met in detention whose 2-year-old baby was sick. "They just keep telling me to give her water," the mother said. Her back was covered in sores. And it was only with the Congressmember there that she finally got medical attention..@AmerAcadPeds's @ddooley1: The American Academy of Pediatrics is a non-partisan and pro-children organization with 66K members. 

We are opposed to family detention because no amount of time in detention is safe for a child and it can cause irreparable damage..@supportKIND's @JPodKul: This manufactured crisis can end now. For those who want an orderly and efficient process, we should stop the wasteful prosecutions of asylum seekers. We can use effective alternatives to detentions. Family detention is being offered as a false choice.@iMelissaBrunet Watch here: https://t.co/JbL6bKqS7ORepublicans in Congress won't hold hearings on Trump's family separation and incarceration policies. They are part of covering up these abuses.

So we're holding our own hearing.

We invite all members to join us. https://t.co/rgPxoPyNs8It's been 10 days since I visited the prison near Seattle where more than 200 women and men had been transferred from the border.

The president responded to the pressure today but his policies are STILL cruel and inhumane to immigrant families. So I will not let up for a moment. https://t.co/645nUmj8jIüëáüèΩüëáüèΩüëáüèΩ https://t.co/vJHZT7QJnVExactly. https://t.co/TeokUbAgGaDonald Trump's new order is a response to an outcry from the American people. We must reject the false choice between separating children from parents and putting families in cages. Both are horrific. Both are wrong. 

We cannot let up until we have a humane system in place. https://t.co/TAWUmarxLB@tclep üíÖüèΩI broke down how the latest GOP budget resolution shreds the safety net and attacks the critical benefits that have been earned by hard-working Americans. 

It's the Republican 3-step dance in action: Cut taxes for the rich, balloon the deficit, slash programs like Medicare. https://t.co/vqrnSIuJoxLet's also be clear the order Trump intends to sign will likely still continue family separation &amp; will almost certainly allow for indefinite detention of families. That's both illegal &amp; cruel and inhumane. So, no celebration just yet. Hope I'm wrong but not holding my breath.Let's be clear: Trump does not need to sign an executive order to stop the cruel policy of separating children from their parents. All he  needs to do is pick up the phone and call Sessions and Neilson and tell them to stop. He started it, he can end it with  a phone call.Thank you  @united. Every corporation should ensure that their technology, labor and resources are not used to separate children from their parents. https://t.co/AQOIHTLweBThe president wants to use children to secure more extreme anti-immigrant provisions. 

We won't have it. If you want Congress to pass a bill, the Keep Families Together Act is what we should be signing.I think the American people's hearts are breaking. People are standing up across the country. 

@realDonaldTrump, we don't need legislation or even an executive order. Pick up the phone and tell @SecNielsen to STOP THE ABUSE. We refuse to hold children hostage.The mothers I met with talked about being deceived and not having a chance to say goodbye to their own kids. All of them are looking for a better life for our families and our children. 

When the president tries to equate these people with criminals, he is not telling the truth. https://t.co/aU3QXXBuDb.@NancyPelosi: "How low can you go?... It's important for people to know the truth. When the president said these actions are not of his doing, he is not telling the truth."Alternate stream: https://t.co/eunuwnUJKN #FamiliesBelongTogetherLIVE: I believe we are winning this fight to stop family separation.

https://t.co/jE5zHOALwkOn the House floor today, we stood with children to highlight the fact that kids should always feel safe, protected and free from fear. There's no excuse for #FamilySeparation‚Äîit is abuse and a human rights violation.

We will keep fighting because #FamiliesBelongTogether.This is a country that should value our children. Instead, @realdonaldtrump is holding kids in cages and tent cities at the border.

He has chosen to take this democracy to its very bottom. He must end the family separation crisis he created NOW. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/UfFQABAWU1This injustice must end. And Trump must end it. I am with my @HouseDemocrats colleagues speaking out against the cruelty of family separation. Join us.

#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/kWdHEbWOagJoin me on June 30th to March in support of families who‚Äôve been separated at the border..@SecNielsen told a lot of lies this week. She made it sound like kids separated from families are at a summer camp. This is in complete contradiction to what is ACTUALLY happening. #EndFamilySeparationThis is a problem that @realDonaldTrump created, and it‚Äôs a problem that HE can fix TODAY.The Ryan bill is not a moderate Bill. It doesn‚Äôt fix the problem at the border. It allows indefinite family detention. It contains a whole host of problematic provisions. It‚Äôs still an anti-immigrant bill.I know there are mothers and fathers on the other side of the aisle. Republicans must speak up. They need to say something.Many families that have been separated are asylum seekers. We cannot, should not treat them like criminals. They are escaping violence, looking for a safe place to build a life for their children.Going on @bpshow NOW to talk about @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs inhumane and cruel family separation policy. #EndFamilySeparationThe only way Tom Homan, acting ICE director, can answer the question of whether the cruel "zero-tolerance" policy is humane is to try to put it on the law. He cannot defend the indefensible. #FamiliesBelongTogtherCruel family separation denounced across board. Koch network: Trump should "take immediate action to end separation of families by rescinding 'zero tolerance' policy."US Chamber: ‚ÄúThere is no other way to say it, this is not who we are &amp; it must end now.‚Äù #FamiliesBelongTogether"Don‚Äôt leave me, Mom."

We are winning this fight. We can end this injustice if all of us, in large numbers, take action.Spoke with @bbcworldservice about family separation yesterday. America, the world is watching. This is about what is right and wrong, our morals &amp; our leadership in the world. https://t.co/GcrojkLv0bWe are increasing the pressure to stop family separation and the Trump administration is feeling it. That's why they're deflecting and lying about what they are actually doing. 

We can't afford to think about not winning this fight, because the lives of children are at stake. https://t.co/282FZRwA1Z
