These orgs are on the frontlines doing critical work with those affected by these cruel policies. #EndFamilyDetention #DACALast night I joined @maddow on @MSNBC to discuss the House Judiciary's “emergency” hearing with DAG Rosenstein and FBI Director Wray, where @HouseGOP continued their efforts to help @realDonaldTrump by attacking DOJ and attempting to undermine the Special Counsel investigation. https://t.co/6CoaDBK84oHappy to be @bjnyc tonight talking about what’s going on in Washington, voting rights, and how to stay engaged. https://t.co/Mh4mR2STE6Terrible tragedy today at #CapitalGazette in Annapolis, MD. We can do something to stop this violence. We MUST do something to stop these tragedies and the senseless loss of life. Congress should take the necessary action to #EndGunViolence.While we continue to sit in @HouseJudiciary hearing with Republicans pushing conspiracy theories against DOJ, FBI and Special Counsel Mueller, happening now: #WomenDisobey protests at the DOJ building to #EndFamilyDetention. https://t.co/icVrzoimdWToday, I spoke on the House floor against the ridiculous, conspiracy-fueled @HouseGOP resolution targeting the DOJ in an effort to undermine and discredit the Special Counsel investigation. Watch here: https://t.co/unteqysM7FWatch my statement from “emergency” hearing into the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation – yet another conspiracy theory being pushed by @HouseGOP while ignoring family separation, election security, DOJ refusing to defend the ACA, or any other area needing emergency action. https://t.co/naozwMcnjlRead my statement on Justice #Kennedy's announced retirement from the U.S. Supreme Court:  https://t.co/SqZjChR5PM https://t.co/A6Lxpvc8ZSToday's #Janus decision unjustifiably overturns a decades old-precedent, placing the needs of corporations and special interests over those of vulnerable employees and consumers. This is a serious blow to the many public employees who serve and protect the American people. https://t.co/Eu1CpBvUZHRead my statement w/ @ProChoiceCaucus co-chairs @RepBarbaraLee &amp; @RepDianaDeGette, and @RepJudyChu on SCOTUS's shameful decision in #NIFLAvBecerra, allowing crisis pregnancy centers to deceive and deny women their constitutional right to an abortion. #EndTheLies https://t.co/sqgvCnmShDToday is #LGBTEqualityDay, when we celebrate historic advances in freedom, and strengthen our resolve for the fights for equality not yet won. #EqualityForward https://t.co/lv5oWLGbunThe Trump @FCC repealed #NetNeutrality, but the fight for a free and open internet continues. I am proud to sign my name on the House discharge petition to protect consumers and #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/LnuJ1mbNPPSince the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder five years ago, more than two dozen states have enacted anti-voter laws that make it harder to register and harder to cast your ballot. Every American must be guaranteed a voice in our democracy – we must #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/pyLKaH5HoSDue process is a bedrock American legal principle. It ensures that the gov’t doesn’t abuse its power to prosecute. No matter your political beliefs, we all need these protections.  We must all reject Trump’s latest threat to our democracy.  https://t.co/XMLuDW39wIHappy #Pride! Together we can continue the fight for equal rights for #LGBT Americans.

Thought you might enjoy a throwback to my speech at the 1993 Gay and Lesbian March on Washington https://t.co/tbwtcKaBhAAs the Representative in Congress who spearheaded the establishment of the #StonewallNationalMonument, we must do all we can to ensure that the legacy of Stonewall is preserved, honored  and shared for generations to come. 2/2It is important we do all we can to help protect the history of the #Stonewall Uprisings and I’m disappointed but not surprised that the Trump Administration attempted to downplay that legacy. 1/2 https://t.co/7mTMWngXuBDebate continues now, on immoral @HouseGOP immigration bill #2. https://t.co/I3erBXbzLZIn case you were wondering if the reporting on her jacket message was a just a joke from the Onion. . . apparently not. https://t.co/0GE23R7S9pWell said @NYMag https://t.co/cqfkQ5M5I2I encourage everyone to watch the House debates happening now on the draconian GOP immigration bills.  Watch as the @HouseGOP  insults American values w/a laundry list of hateful, far-Right proposals perpetuating the abuse of children and doing nothing meaningful for Dreamers. https://t.co/FSqAElKh7fAdditionally, the dangerous new Trump Executive Order does nothing to deal with the 2000+ children who are already separated from their families.  How will they be reunited with their parents?  That work must begin immediately. https://t.co/5KTOwHlIYrSimply put:
Trump family separation policy=child abuse
AND
Long term detention in military facilities (New Trump Executive Order)=child abuse.This is disgusting. @realDonaldTrump uses what amounts to government-sponsored child abuse as a bargaining chip to force through his extreme agenda. We have a legal and moral obligation to protect the most vulnerable among us. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/juZvsVoRcFProud to stand with @NancyPelosi and over 190 of my @HouseDemocrats colleagues today on behalf of the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct - We have a legal on moral obligation to act, and the Trump Admin family separation policy must stop. https://t.co/R2ARBSQ1QfThe President could end this cruel family separation policy today, but instead he uses it as a political bargaining chip to push his agenda. That is why Congress must act, and I am proud to introduce the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/2K6K8xrJ07Proud to be joined by over 190 of my colleagues in introducing the #KeepFamilesTogetherAct to stop the cruel, immoral and dangerous ‘zero tolerance’ enforcement policy separating families seeking asylum in the US. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/1mIYJBxUooYes, family separation is bad. But what about Hillary Clinton’s emails? https://t.co/kJJzR5ww30 via @washingtonpostYou can read more about the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct here: https://t.co/VroomF9mQZ https://t.co/A0kABXfDtPThe #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct is the House companion to the legislation introduced by @SenFeinstein earlier this month, and promotes family unity by prohibiting @DHSgov officials from separating children from their parents, except in extraordinary circumstances. 2/2 https://t.co/dUtDsbccwrToday, I introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct along with over 190 of my @HouseDemocrats colleagues so that we can end the horrific family separation happening at the border as a result of the Admin's 'zero tolerance' policy. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/VroomF9mQZ 1/2 https://t.co/WccgN4DxYhListen to children who’ve just been separated from their parents at the border https://t.co/lN8OEc92mY via @ProPublicaThis Admin has the nerve to publicly blame Democrats for the immoral family separation ripping children from parents. @realDonaldTrump set up this "zero tolerance" policy to reduce immigration by terrorizing those seeking refuge, and he has the power to end this crisis today. https://t.co/KyZfq4cN6ehttps://t.co/zxv7hRUz3cThis is not correct. I was at the ICE detention center in Elizabeth, NJ this morning and met with parents separated from their children when they entered the US seeking asylum. @SecNielsen should be honest about the Admin’s enforcement policies. https://t.co/Cvhp8Vh99Ghttps://t.co/K4tYfh2Tf2 @FrankPallone @BillPascrell @RepJeffries @RepMaloney @RepSires @RepEspaillat #FamilesBelongTogetherEchoing my colleague @RepJeffries: “Republicans control House, Senate and presidency. @realDonaldTrump should stop lying about who is responsible for this indecency.” https://t.co/JTNc7q97Tzhttps://t.co/GTIRuqDbhphttps://t.co/mjx7VuB1MUSharing what we learned inside Elizabeth, NJ ICE detention facility #EndFamilySeparation #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/WLfkJJDDqRWe are coming outside now and plan to tell everyone about what is going on inside these ICE detention centers. #FamilesBelongTogether #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/GcPLrXpmJQI am at an ICE detention center in Elizabeth, NJ with @BillPascrell @RepEspaillat @FrankPallone @RepMaloney @RepJeffries and @RepSires. One thing is certainly clear, the Admin’s family separation policy is an absolute disgrace. #EndFamilySeparation #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/thhPJOn2vYWe are now inside speaking with detainees who were separated from their children when they sought asylum in the US from terrible violence and danger at home. We will be addressing the media outside shortly. #FamilesBelongTogether #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/CfvQJVxDXGWalking inside facility now, with @RepEspaillat and @BillPascrell.

Have spoken with the supervisor but we refuse to leave until able to meet with the detainees. #FamilesBelongTogether #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/8hdY9OeGXWWhile we are inside the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility trying to get access and speak with detainees, a huge group has gathered outside to protest the Administration’s #FamilySeparation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether #FathersDay https://t.co/k3cOC7oFwOWith my congressional colleagues, confronting ICE officials, demanding to go in and meet with parents harmed by the Trump Admin’s brutal #ZeroTolerance policy.  #EndFamilySeparation #FathersDayofAction https://t.co/3ehg9THdvhAt the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility, they are asking us to wait 45 min for the director to arrive — despite permissions from detainees and attorneys. https://t.co/SQE4y8UJcnInside the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility with @FrankPallone @RepSires @RepJeffries @RepEspaillat @BillPascrell @RepMaloney waiting to meet with detainees separated from their children. https://t.co/9TKjyLSRumWe are now entering the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility to speak with asylum seekers who have been separated from their children and detained as a direct result of the Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy. #FamilySeparation #FathersDay https://t.co/RebXQyk5lcThis #FathersDay I’m leading a meeting, along with @FrankPallone @RepSires @RepMaloney @RepJeffries @RepEspaillat @BillPascrell, to visit detainees separated from their family at the ICE detention center in Elizabeth, NJ.

Tune in at 6pm 📺 https://t.co/0RAhuPpRHEWhat is clear from the @TheJusticeDept IG report is that there is no evidence of improper bias in the investigation. Republicans must face up to reality and accept the facts. https://t.co/EnYZSzkr8YJoining @SenateDems and @HouseDemocrats colleagues to discuss @TheJusticeDept IG report issued today, which is clear in finding NO EVIDENCE of bias or other improper considerations in investigation. https://t.co/JZ0KdGj8MXRead my statement in response to the release of the DOJ #IGReport on FBI activities prior to the 2016 election: https://t.co/6hspjbYe9c https://t.co/g3gvKv67acThe NY AG has sued @realDonaldTrump’s charity for “persistently illegal conduct” – including misusing funds to decorate his private golf club. In the White House or Trump Tower, the President has no regard for the rule of law. https://t.co/xMtoY7t2Q9In light of today's #IGReport, a reminder of my questioning of former FBI Director James Comey back in September 2016. https://t.co/RXmaEAvAwBThis Administration's extreme anti-immigrant agenda destroys our nation's history as a refuge for the persecuted. I reject @realDonaldTrump's family separation policy and his callous decision to bar asylum to the most vulnerable victims of domestic and gang violence. https://t.co/isKCTceNlhI support @RepJayapal’s call for a @HouseJudiciary hearing on the Admin’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy. Family separation as a deliberate means to deter people from fleeing violence and seeking asylum is un-American and defies our history as a beacon of freedom. https://t.co/8ThEIvf3yRAttorney General Sessions’ refusal to defend key protections in the #ACA for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions is outrageous and unprecedented. Proud to join my colleagues in calling out this overtly cruel political action. https://t.co/BknWbV1gWpToday, @RepJayapal spoke out passionately at our @HouseJudiciary markup regarding the Administration's shameful "zero tolerance" immigration policy. Watch her full statement: https://t.co/7hy1xeP3WsICYMI: Read my statement condemning the Trump Administration's unconscionable decision to end asylum protections for domestic violence survivors. https://t.co/VzSEJBUX6P https://t.co/hB4ugGC4AtToday's #SCOTUS decision undermines our strong commitment to the protection of voting rights for all and sets a road map for state-based voter suppression under cover of the law. We must fight to defend every American’s right to be heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/mTcL5oJB49Despite overwhelming public support, the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality starts today. Internet openness is vital to promoting innovation, competition, &amp; free expression. I’m fighting to #SaveTheInternet by forcing a vote in the House to ensure a free and open Internet for all.Last year, the @HouseGOP voted to rip protections away from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. Now, @realDonaldTrump is trying to do it again. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/x0r8WJ8aA3Here's my full stmnt from @HouseJudiciary's anti-immigrant hearing on the U.S. Census. I strongly oppose the addition of a citizenship question, which will dramatically reduce participation by immigrant communities and jeopardize the accuracy of the count. #EveryoneCounts https://t.co/flck93nL00Watch my statement strongly condemning the addition of a citizenship question to the #2020Census. The Admin's attempt to deliberately sabotage the census for political purposes and discriminate against immigrants is disgusting, immoral, and hypocritical, and must be stopped. https://t.co/Pb0E6Gy9tA53 years ago, #GriswoldvCT ruled that women cannot be denied the right to access birth control. We can't let @realDonaldTrump bring us backwards - we must continue to fight for comprehensive #reprohealth care for ALL and #ProtectTitleX #ThanksGriswoldProud to meet with @ERACoalition and @Alyssa_Milano to discuss why we need an Equal Rights Amendment. It's past time to make clear that the Constitution guarantees equal rights for women. #ERAnow https://t.co/pakCSrhSuRLooking forward to meeting with @Alyssa_Milano tomorrow. https://t.co/RJeBV5XI4tThis news report is beyond belief. It is both terrifying and outrageous to think that this is how the Trump Administration answers the pleas of Americans who are crying out for an end to gun violence in our schools. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/uwWOR4myosRead my Op-Ed in @thehill: Trump Administration’s asylum and family separation policy runs counter to American values https://t.co/a8s5Ijw0PW #FamiliesBelongTogether #EndFamilySeparationPresident Trump seems to be under the impression that he is the embodiment of the Department of Justice and that he is above the law. Nothing — nothing — could be farther from the truth. #NoOneAboveTheLawWhile @realDonaldTrump and his lawyers roll out increasingly tenuous legal theories about pardons and subpoenas, the investigations into the Trump campaign move ahead undeterred. #ProtectMueller https://t.co/wPaa0ItgjpIn an attempt to intimidate Special Counsel Mueller, @realDonaldTrump has signaled that he may pardon those who are involved in the Russia investigation. This misuse of pardons would create a serious constitutional crisis in our country. https://t.co/2cALhb7C6jCongress should immediately take up the #EqualityAct to create unambiguous, nationwide anti-discrimination protections for #LGBT Americans. Read my statement on the #SCOTUS decision in #MasterpieceCakeshop: https://t.co/HBDOav81IV https://t.co/ezDUUWHrr3Every woman—regardless of immigration status—has the right to make her own decisions about her body + her life.

Happy 70th Birthday Israel! https://t.co/bWosZ7yC51.@realDonaldTrump’s lawyers argue that he is above the law.  WRONG. This is a country founded on the rule of law and no one stands above it. He, like everyone else, is accountable to our laws and must respect our justice system. https://t.co/GS4vSWsz1FIn light of @nytimes report that @realDonaldTrump lawyers are trying to prevent Special Counsel Mueller from completing the investigation, a reminder that the President can either voluntarily agree to an interview OR be forced by a subpoena. https://t.co/2ZR0WrYUBnJoining @AriMelber onset for @TheBeatWithAri at 6pm ET. Tune in 📺This country was founded by countless individuals who fled persecution in search of freedom and opportunity in a new land. I joined over 70 House Members in writing a letter to @SecNielsen to express our outrage and demand @DHSgov clarify their policies. https://t.co/rMG7A5YrRW https://t.co/wkfxH6zVeLThe practice of separating children from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is cruel and violates our obligation to protect and provide safe haven to bona fide refugees. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/FXF6xTzfMZIf you want to understand how @realDonaldTrump Admin’s cruel policies and enforcement tactics are undermining #DueProcess for children and families at the border, you should read this policy brief from @AILANational: https://t.co/1K90WMyucV #KeepFamiliesTogetherThe U.S. is the only country that doesn’t support the #ParisAgreement, thanks to @realDonaldTrump. The President’s failure to demonstrate leadership costs every American and the world as a whole the right to live in a safe and healthy climate. https://t.co/naEnJNGsg6This is absolute nonsense and part of ongoing @RJC attempts to drive a wedge by politicizing support for  Israel. Support for Israel and the US-Israel relationship must not be drawn along partisan lines — suggesting that it is, or should be, shows your true intentions. https://t.co/nC7DwZoguNAnother dangerous and cynical pardon. @realDonaldTrump refuses to consult with DOJ, which would have told him that there are thousands of Americans more deserving of clemency. Instead, he wants the cheap political hit, and to send a message that silence will be rewarded. https://t.co/fagzKi22bn.@realDonaldTrump has done everything he can, as he feels the walls closing in on him, to trash the Special Counsel investigation – all with the intent to either fire Mueller or to discredit the investigation w/ enough nonsense so that any report issued won't be believed. https://t.co/rRW8H7FqgzToday, terrorists in Gaza fired rockets into Israel, some of which landed in a kindergarten schoolyard. Israel has a right to defend itself and protect its citizens from attacks. The world must speak out and condemn such acts of terrorism and violence. https://t.co/WrLMaCu3LICould not agree more. These are the deliberate policies of @realDonaldTrump’s Administration and do not reflect the values we as Americans hold dear. #KeepFamiliesTogether #WeAreTheChildren https://t.co/r1qBWEPHjCI am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend and longtime colleague, Denny Farrell.  He was a giant—literally and figuratively—an amazing public servant, and a true mensch. https://t.co/tNZka6Yo0rThe fact is: @realDonaldTrump has no place making a "demand" of DOJ when it relates to an ongoing investigation OF WHICH HE IS A POSSIBLE SUBJECT. And it is a crime to disclose the identity of a confidential source, which is why I have called for an investigation. https://t.co/eWPRkmK5y3Incredibly moved and inspired watching the people of Ireland this week. To all those who came #hometovote and to everyone working to #repealthe8th: Go raibh maith agat. https://t.co/wbUUbE80IOA deliberate decision to expose the identity of a confidential source is reckless and dangerous. Moreover, the decision to out this operative may be a crime. Today, I wrote to the DOJ and FBI to investigate the source of this disclosure and hold the perpetrators accountable. https://t.co/E7uO2cuUA2Read my full statement from this morning's press conference on @realDonaldTrump’s outrageous “demands” of the DOJ and his refusal to be interviewed by Robert Mueller as part of the Special Counsel investigation https://t.co/u7V4vP2hvL https://t.co/lXGEXKGWSyPresident Trump is engaging in a propaganda campaign of disinformation in order to fundamentally undermine our democratic institutions. He is deliberately turning the rule of law upside-down to suit his own interests, which can only erode the public trust in our justice system. https://t.co/5irU1INGxB"The President must not make decisions about individual law enforcement investigations. That job belongs to the Department of Justice – which may only open a criminal investigation if the investigation is properly predicated on the evidence." https://t.co/u7V4vP2hvL https://t.co/4SiE6nno2yHappening now: @HouseJudDems press conference on @realDonaldTrump’s outrageous “demands” on DOJ and FBI, and his refusal to be interviewed by Special Counsel Mueller. https://t.co/mtGJX6prIGRead my statement on @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP’s reckless and dangerous effort to pressure the Department of Justice into exposing the identity of a top-secret FBI source. https://t.co/D1LyKIfLvwICYMI: Watch my statement opposing HR5682, the FIRST STEP Act. Though this bill make moderate improvements in areas related to our prisons, I cannot support legislation that fails to address the larger issue of sentencing reform. https://t.co/GgpGvSIeEzAs we feared, an extreme new #DomesticGag rule for #TitleX that stops doctors from giving women—especially low income women—full info about #reprohealth and denies millions access to care. Everyone deserves quality, comprehensive care, not govt issued lies from their doctors. https://t.co/Wb42LQtVzORead my statement on House Republicans' profound misunderstanding of our criminal justice system, introducing a resolution to appoint a second special counsel without evidence of any crime. https://t.co/ibSt8ezvIxThe fact that @realDonaldTrump is DEMANDING the DOJ reveal confidential information about an ongoing criminal investigation is more evidence of potential abuses of power by the President. This is not only a threat to the rule of law, but a dangerous precedent for our democracy. https://t.co/w4iUqyLMLKGetting ready to join @AriMelber on @MSNBC. Tune in @TheBeatWithAri https://t.co/x9LfwEnr6yAll too often, big money and special interests have dominated Washington and stopped the people from being heard. @HouseDemocrats are fighting for transparency &amp; accountability so Washington works for everyone. #ABetterDealThis “demand” constitutes another effort to disparage the Special Counel investigation &amp; puts @DOJ in an impossible position. It also threatens to badly damage confidential informants relied on by FBI/intelligence. GOP must help restore rule of law, independent law enforcement. https://t.co/HiPFCrD4UJThe Department of Justice must refuse to comply with this untenable, politically-motivated “demand” from @realdonaldtrump or risk plunging this country into a constitutional crisis. https://t.co/HiPFCrD4UJEveryone regardless of where they live or how much money they make has the right to healthcare, including info about safe, legal abortion.
