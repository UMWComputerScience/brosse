For #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, I called on ALL Americans to come together &amp; remember who we are: a nation of #immigrants past &amp; immigrants present.

We need serious bipartisan #ImmigrationReform for effective #BorderSecurity while respecting the dignity &amp; humanity of all. https://t.co/C1WHmmwlbTFormer @USDA Sec. Tom Vilsack on #tariffs, the #TradeWar, &amp; #CaliforniaAgriculture:
 
"#Agriculture is the solution to the trade deficit, not the problem, especially in #California, the country’s leading agricultural export state."

While there is no single solution to solving our #water problems, continuing to find ways to do more w/ the #water we do have is one critical part. https://t.co/AecrKEodtnToday we in the House rejected the 2nd #immigration bill both R &amp; D leaders have described as “partisan,” “short-sighted,” &amp; “anti-American.”

We must fix our broken immigration system, &amp; I hope after today leadership will support our bipartisan &amp; serious efforts in the House. https://t.co/WmIYoGsTsoToday I joined an overwhelming majority in the House - Rs &amp; Ds alike - in rejecting the 2nd of 2 failed #immigration bills.

My office joined in the @VAFresno &amp; the @HandsOnCC awards ceremonies this week to recognize our #SanJoaquin Valley volunteers. 

Thank you to all our #volunteers! https://t.co/G02z4soxK0It was great to discuss ways to improve our #transportation &amp; #infrastructure w/ #FresnoCOG during their D.C. visit.

The most effective way to serve the people of our Valley is for local, state, &amp; federal gov'ts to work together, &amp; I will continue to work for such collaboration. https://t.co/UiS7pjzjYPAs I told #HouseAg in the #FarmBill Mark-up: Our nation’s #FoodPolicy should not further divide us. The Farm Bill is America's food bill, &amp; it needs to be about feeding ALL of us: farmers &amp; consumers, rich &amp; poor, Ds &amp; Rs. 

Let's get back to work &amp; pass a bipartisan Farm Bill. https://t.co/5WjdxO993gOn #DenimDay, we stand together to fight misconceptions surrounding sexual assault.

There is #NoExcuseForAssault. Period.

As co-founder &amp; co-chair of the #CongressionalVictimsRightsCaucus, I will continue to fight these misconceptions &amp; work for justice for survivors. 

#EndSA https://t.co/a3GE09eGKfI joined fellow #SanJoaquin Valley representative, @RepDavidValadao, to commemorate the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in the House.

We must #NeverForget &amp; we must learn from this dark time so we can move toward a world free of such atrocities. 

I stand w/ Armenians across our #SanJoaquin Valley &amp; the world to say “Menk Chenk Morranna." We won’t forget. https://t.co/qKWabWL8nkToday marks the 103rd anniversary of the #ArmenianGenocide. 

This past weekend, I joined leaders &amp; our #SanJoaquin Valley #Armenian community in #Fresno to commemorate the genocide &amp; honor the 1.5 million Armenian lives lost during the atrocity.

#NeverForget @ANCA_DC https://t.co/eDR0qZgXtAThis weekend in #Fresno, the @laoveterans &amp; #SGU #Veterans welcomed the Lao Veterans of America's new president.

Vic is a true #AmericanHero.

Our veterans, servicemembers, &amp; their families sacrifice so much to protect our freedom, we can never say thank you enough. https://t.co/ckOWm4ra2rLet me be clear: We must protect Social Security, Medicare, and other safety net programs that provide security for Americans and our nation’s future. 

To do so, we must take serious action to balance our budget, &amp; this action must include plans to protect these vital programs. https://t.co/2BrG91QQqAThank you to everyone who made our new @MercedCounty Behavioral Health &amp; Recovery Services Center possible, and to all who work hard every day to help improve the health and well-being of the people of our #SanJoaquin Valley.

Our thoughts and prayers are with President Bush and his family.

May she rest in peace, and may God bless her. https://t.co/mJuDnQlnt4From my statement on #HouseAg #FarmBill Mark-up:

"I am, &amp; I have always been, committed to commonsense #farm &amp; #FoodPolicy that feeds Americans &amp; ensures our #farmers, #ranchers, &amp; #dairy producers can be successful. Unfortunately, we did not consider this type of policy today." https://t.co/mCX6MpszaZThe livelihood of many American &amp; #CA #farmers depends on #Trade. #MAP &amp; #FMD have proven track records of successfully supporting our #Ag producers by helping to further open and develop foreign markets for #USAgriculture. We should support these programs more in the #FarmBill. https://t.co/H0JBkEVRarCongratulations to @FresnoZoo for its new addition, Betty Lou, a Masai giraffe.

She is the first Masai giraffe to live at our #Fresno #zoo since 1994.

Welcome, Betty Lou, to our #SanJoaquin Valley home!

For more from the @FresnoBee: https://t.co/NxnGPOzRO8 https://t.co/kHVHqY47uDThe partisan #FarmBill we will consider in #HouseAg tomorrow makes changes to #SNAP that will likely devastate parts of the program that are working well. 

SNAP is vital to the health of our #SanJoaquin Valley and communities - both rural &amp; urban - across the US.

#ProtectSNAPOur nation's #FoodPolicy should serve the widest range of Americans possible. It should not further divides us.

While the #FarmBill in #HouseAg this week has some good parts, it abandons too many Americans, &amp; it intensifies divisions between regions &amp; groups in our country. https://t.co/4jpGXATdoJCongratulations to our first @ucmerced #Fulbright Scholar!

For info regarding #CA services for @HelpingVictims: https://t.co/867H6R8dQh https://t.co/QAF5AGVAz5Before these #tariffs were raised, I said they would cause a #TradeWar, w/ #agriculture as a prime target. The tariffs were raised, &amp; now $2B in CA Ag exports are direct targets. This hurts our #SanJoaquin Valley &amp; costs us jobs.

@RAMIREZBOXING #Boxing #RamirezImam https://t.co/dNQFsG1NStWithout fixing our broken #immigration system, I'm concerned these I-9 audits will be counterproductive, divert @ICEgov resources from other critical enforcement priorities, and have severe &amp; disproportionate economic impacts on communities like ours in the #SanJoaquin Valley. https://t.co/E6RN5lkERYToday I urged @Interior @SecretaryZinke to increase pumping during storms falling in our #SanJoaquin Valley &amp; across #CA.

We in the @HouseBlueDogs have endorsed @RosLehtinen &amp; #BlueDog @RepSchneider's bipartisan DETER Act to protect our elections. https://t.co/hhqs56F4m7We face real challenges w/ #housing issues &amp; #homelessness in our #SanJoaquin Valley, so it was great to meet w/ @HUDgov key staff members responsible for serving our region. We discussed Valley housing needs &amp; priorities as well as our ongoing efforts to address homelessness. https://t.co/AaZgbBXmYpWe must listen to our agriculture communities regarding the challenges they face in putting food on Americans’ dinner tables. That's why I joined @USDA @SecretarySonny &amp; Reps. Denham &amp; Valadao at the @World_Ag_Expo  #agriculture town hall today. For more: https://t.co/2d2Jvac1UP https://t.co/kbYFMGI3eCIt was great to tour the @World_Ag_Expo w/ @SecretarySonny today.
