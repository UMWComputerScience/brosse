We‚Äôre not going away, @realDonaldTrump.

You cannot distract us.

You cannot dismiss us.

It‚Äôs time for your #FamilySeparation policy to end, once and for all!

85 days and counting...

#FamilySeparationCrisis https://t.co/W7pm0DKH35Wrapped up #FathersMonth today w/ @PHFEWic in Pico Union to recognize the important role fathers play in their children‚Äôs lives.

WIC helps our #WorkingFamilies w/ vital nutrition &amp; health services.

Congrats to all the fathers who completed the WIC Father‚Äôs Project! #SuperWICDad https://t.co/oQPVGPmtA0.@lawyer_moms thank you for visiting my district office. You are correct, we need to keep the focus on the kids and families that have been torn apart because of Trump‚Äôs zero tolerance policy....#Day84 of Trump‚Äôs Separation Crisis #FamilesBelongTogether #ReuniteFamiliesNow https://t.co/yFY4qX2n5D@queenmaryresist @HHSGov I‚Äôll be there!Hmm, I wonder why the #GOPTaxScam is so unpopular?

Could it be that it overwhelmingly helps the top 1% &amp; leaves #WorkingFamilies in the dust?

Or maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs raising premiums &amp; leaving fewer Americans insured?

It‚Äôs a real head scratcher. ü§î

https://t.co/2tWdZNClMOWhen it comes to these kids, we need more transparency and more accountability. 

In response, my colleagues and I recently introduced a new bill ‚Äî the Congressional Access to Children's Detention Facilities Act ‚Äî giving Congress and media greater access to immigration centers. https://t.co/S6Zt1rjPBMWhen I visited the Tornillo detention facility for children, I was only granted access to the command center and allowed to observe the kids through a video feed.

Wasn‚Äôt allowed to walk through the facility.

Wasn‚Äôt allowed to tour the #TentCity.

What is @HHSGov trying to hide? https://t.co/kiaO73lD9nAnd only hours after a mass shooting in their newsroom...

The strength and resolve of those who work at @capgaznews is nothing short of inspiring.

There‚Äôs nothing that can be said to heal the wounds of this tragedy. The only way forward is with action. 

https://t.co/F9ek8z0UpUJoined @HouseDemocrats to highlight millions of Americans w/ a #PreexistingCondition who are at risk due to @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs attacks on #Obamacare.

Thanks to #Obamacare, my constituent ‚Äî Kathleen Danowsky ‚Äî was able to get help for her chronic type 2 diabetes.

#ProtectOurCare https://t.co/OvK8HrchWhDuring my time with @AFSCME and @UNACUHCP, I saw our labor community‚Äôs resilience and determination firsthand. Yesterday was tough but I have no doubt #AmericanWorkers will weather this storm. 

And I‚Äôll be right there with them every step of the way.

#UnionStrong #JanusDecision https://t.co/Anoz61eTn2#TeamGomez recently presented awards to local members of the Latin American community at the Festival Juliana Awards Night!

Those in the #LaborCommunity can rest assured I will continue to proudly represent them &amp; fight for their dignity on the national stage.

#UnionStrong #UnionProudThrough my work w/ @AFSCME &amp; @UNACUHCP, I have a unique understanding as to how important strong unions are in creating an economy that gives all Americans a chance to thrive, not just the wealthiest among us.

#UnionStrong #UnionProudThe decision struck a personal cord for me as I began my political career in the labor community as an organizer &amp; continue to fight for their rights today in the House of Representatives. 

#UnionProud #UnionStrongIn the wake of this decision, it will be vital for Congress to work even harder to ensure our nation‚Äôs labor force has the capacity to join a union &amp; enhance the safeguards needed to secure better working conditions, better wages &amp; access to health care.

#UnionStrong #UnionProudImportant thread about #JANUSvsAFSCME:

Today‚Äôs ruling represents a stunning setback for #AmericanWorkers who continue to struggle to secure economic stability for themselves &amp; their families.

#UnionStrong #UnionProud#MarriageEquality became law 3 years ago today.

Since then, I‚Äôve celebrated my brother &amp; his partner as they were finally allowed to say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù &amp; had the honor of officiating the wedding of my friends Todd &amp; Alex.

For this @LGBTEqCaucus member, #LGBTEqualityDay is everyday. https://t.co/BlXUs0NjorOnce again, @HouseGOP is trying to silence the voices of those who want to protect our country's most vital environmental protections.

As a member of @NRDems, I‚Äôll do everything in my power to defend environmental standards that put #PeopleBeforeProfits!

https://t.co/UP1iAqei1JFuture generations will look back at today‚Äôs #SCOTUS #MuslimBan ruling as a dark day in our history.

But together we will continue to provide support &amp; warmth in a world that too many of our Muslim brothers &amp; sisters find cold since @realDonaldTrump took office. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/M47vrbBGuBWomen ‚Äî particularly #WomenOfColor ‚Äî already face too many barriers to getting the #ReproductiveHealth services they need.

Sadly, this #SCOTUS decision only makes matters worse. https://t.co/aiCXnyl61XI‚Äôve been to the border twice in two weeks (San Diego &amp; Tornillo) &amp; I‚Äôve seen the #TentCity w/ my own eyes.

Everyone I spoke to - from contractors to immigration officials - told me this crisis was manufactured by @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #ZeroTolerance policy. https://t.co/nfQf6GHGh8Thanks to @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #TradeWar, @HarleyDavidson announced today they‚Äôll be shifting more of its production out of the US.

This is just another example of this administration‚Äôs ongoing assault against #AmericanWorkers and their families.

https://t.co/PrKpnT5fZpSix months after the #Obamacare individual mandate was scrapped as part of #GOPTaxScam, it‚Äôs impossible to ignore its crushing impact on #WorkingFamilies.

#BarrioAction #YouthInAction #YouthSuccess https://t.co/JKQICPIMye#EqualRepresentation: It‚Äôs why we conduct a census. It ensures all of us have a voice.

@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs decision to add a citizenship question to #2020Census is an attempt to marginalize minority communities economically, politically and socially.

#NALEOConf18
#EveryoneCounts https://t.co/gZjkxWrBYVNews @SecretaryRoss considered a citizenship question for #2020Census months before @TheJusticeDept asked he do so is clear evidence of a concerted effort by @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs administration to deceive @OversightDems &amp; mislead the public.

Always proud of our community for its ongoing commitment to most vulnerable among us. https://t.co/xbefvsxbryOnce again @HouseGOP is after #SNAP.

They just passed a bill to prevent millions of #WorkingClass Americans from getting #FoodStamps!

Putting food on the table for your family shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. 

The so-called #ProFamily party strikes again! https://t.co/3SEouqaYQ3Report by @LATbermudez:

Nearly 100 kids separated from their loved ones are being housed in detention facilities &amp; foster homes in the greater LA region.

@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs inhumane #ZeroTolerance policy is a global problem that hits home across the US.

https://t.co/ijVfnmW71VToday I‚Äôm calling on @realDonaldTrump to fire Stephen Miller.

As long as he has a role in this @WhiteHouse, we‚Äôll never be able to move forward with meaningful immigration reform.

His presence in government is a threat to every immigrant in this country. https://t.co/ujWtELHhBo https://t.co/Q00tRcnDKKFamilies belong in communities, not in cages.

This is far from over, folks. 

Our collective outrage took us this far. Don‚Äôt let up now &amp; definitely don‚Äôt fall for the latest PR move by this @WhiteHouse.

Reject it all!

#FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/eSyFYRTBWgIt does absolutely nothing for thousands of children who have been separated from their parents since their zero-tolerance policy began.

Can you imagine how happy @StephenMillerAL must be right now knowing his #FamilySeparation policy opened the door to family interment camps?Thread about @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs executive order:

I‚Äôve had time to read it &amp; it fixes nothing. 

Families seeking asylum shouldn‚Äôt be detained in the first place!

@WhiteHouse‚Äôs zero-tolerance policy is still in effect for all asylum seekers escaping domestic abuse/gang violence. https://t.co/rsRIV5AnNZIran, North Korea &amp; Eritrea were the only countries that refused to participate in @UN_HRC.

That is, until @realDonaldTrump added us to the list.

Our withdrawal from the most vital global #HumanRights organization will be a stain on our nation‚Äôs history. https://t.co/h5cM31l8MySoon @realDonaldTrump will sign executive order to supposedly end his #FamilySeparation policy, which he said was impossible days ago.

Playing hero by ‚Äúfixing‚Äù a humanitarian crisis he started to save his own skin is low.

I don‚Äôt trust him. I need to see the text of this order. https://t.co/BAcrZ2ZVHbVIDEO: Kids may not watch the news, but they know what‚Äôs going on. They hear families are being separated.

We have to ask ourselves, what are they thinking? How are they affected?

We have to set an example and stop this gov‚Äôt sanctioned child abuse today. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/pPWknyQ1rySo happy #TeamGomez had the opportunity to join @APADRC for their 17th Annual Conversity Awards Dinner!

#FamiliesBelongTogther

https://t.co/1EIMWLMqv5 https://t.co/zbJAhYJsqAToday at the border it was clear Trump‚Äôs NEW #FamilySeparation policy was cultivating an atmosphere of confusion for all officials we met.

No straight answers. No idea how to handle asylum seekers. It‚Äôs a mess!

It‚Äôs #FakeNews @WhiteHouse can‚Äôt end this. They just don‚Äôt want to. https://t.co/ebixP0oT8YListen to the cries of these kids in this @ProPublica clip.

This is what @WhiteHouse‚Äôs #FamilySeparation policies sound like.

@realDonaldTrump COULD end this child abuse today.

But he won‚Äôt. He‚Äôd rather use these children as bargaining chips. Shameful.

@WhiteHouse is lying to the American people saying #FamilySeparation has been the law for years! False!On the bus with @HouseDemocrats on the way to tour a local Office of Refugee Resettlement location where unaccompanied children are being held.

Let‚Äôs remember the soldiers who gave their lives to defend America while their families faced injustice and discrimination at home. https://t.co/2yDSs5BVmiI‚Äôm damn proud to #WearOrange and even prouder to represent these strong and determined advocates in Congress.

Their tireless commitment to establishing common sense #GunReform is nothing short of incredible.

Thanks for letting me drop by this week in Los Angeles, @MomsDemand! https://t.co/5huJQlV5QWHaving the support of groups like @CHIRLA @KidsPartnership @Carecen_LA means the world to me, truly.

Thanks for standing w/ me yesterday as I called on @OversightDems &amp; @GOPoversight to investigate the treatment of immigrant children in federal custody.

https://t.co/1QTJv9DQiR https://t.co/3N0sxAXLA0This week, I visited my friends at @SCAGnews to talk about the importance of infrastructure investments and to take a tour of their facility.

Los Angeles is an infrastructure success story, one I plan to take back to Washington for all to see. https://t.co/vNQbQDezvQCongrats to Maria Salinas for being named @LAAreaChamber‚Äôs new President &amp; CEO!

Not only is Maria amazing, but she‚Äôs now the 1st female leader in the organization‚Äôs history!

https://t.co/21XWy52O7eICYMI: Our morning #WhereAreTheChildren press conference addressing concerns over reports @HHSGov lost track of 1,475 unaccompanied minors last year &amp; to say Enough is Enough #FamiliesBelongTogether WATCH: https://t.co/hjWmQ7XjFiWe need to know that these immigrant children are being housed in clean facilities.

We need to know if they have access to quality health services &amp; fair legal representation.

And if @HouseGOP truly cares about children as they claim they do, they‚Äôll join us in this endeavor.That‚Äôs why today, I‚Äôm calling on @OversightDems and @GOPoversight to hold a hearing into the treatment of these kids in federal custody.

Our constituents deserve transparency and accountability!

They deserve to have their voices heard and their questions answered.Taking in children whose lives are being threatened is a part of our asylum system.
 
It‚Äôs required under international law!
 
#SeparatingFamilies to deter others from exercising their right to seek protection is inexcusable. 

The best place for a child is with their family.Jeff Sessions says it‚Äôs their fault for coming here ‚Äúillegally.‚Äù
 
But he failed to mention that there's NOTHING illegal about coming to our border &amp; asking for asylum.
 
These families aren‚Äôt necessarily trying to sneak in.
 
They are coming to the border &amp; asking for our help.Since day 1, @realDonaldTrump has!tried to paint these immigrants as criminals and rapists.

They‚Äôre not.

They‚Äôre people like you and me, except they‚Äôre escaping drug cartels, gang violence &amp; domestic abuse.
 
And there‚Äôs not a shred of evidence #FamilySeparation even works!We all know they use family separation as a deterrent.
 
Take a minute to think about that, seriously.
 
The @realDonaldTrump administration intentionally hurts children and inflicts trauma to scare their families out of coming here for a better life.But these children arrived at the Southwest border alone.
 
They weren‚Äôt victims of the president‚Äôs #FamilySeparation policies.

But sadly, there are too many innocent kids out there that have been victimized. Far too many...We‚Äôve all seen the reports about the 1,475 unaccompanied minors last year.
 
We‚Äôve also heard the trump administration say that‚Äôs entirely untrue.
 
Today we set the record straight.
 
The @realDonaldTrump administration did lose track of these children. This is absolutely true.Thread:

Our press conference is about to start. We‚Äôre going to address concerns over reports @HHSGov lost track of 1,475 unaccompanied minors last year &amp; tackle an array of immigration issues with @CHIRLA, @Carecen_LA &amp; @KidsPartnership.

Watch it LIVE: https://t.co/hjWmQ7XjFiTomorrow morning at 9am PT, @CHIRLA, @CASTLA, @CARECEN_LA, @kidspartnership &amp; other local organizations will join me for a press conference on the @realDonaldTrump administration‚Äôs shameful treatment of immigrant kids.

Hope to see everyone there! 

RSVP: https://t.co/SOpiGTqiyeTypical @realDonaldTrump.
 
He has time to complain about @ABCNetwork canceling a show but he‚Äôs way too busy to shed light on how #PuertoRico is still suffering after #HurricaneMaria.

This man‚Äôs priorities are absurd.

Reminder: This was a domestic disaster, not a foreign one. https://t.co/6f1xIuvIfOCan't tell you what an honor it was to have met w/ the new Consul General of Korea in Los Angeles, Kim Wan-Joong &amp; Consul Moon Ji-Hye. We tackled several important topics that my Korean American constituents care about including US-Korean relations &amp; ongoing talks w/ North Korea. https://t.co/XeAhO5Jx1tLos Angeles. Thurs. May 31st. 9am. RSVP here: https://t.co/SOpiGT8H9E https://t.co/nGiFkTAGbsOur constituents deserve transparency and accountability from the @realDonaldTrump administration, but their demands are being met with obstructionism and political games.

This is unacceptable! You bet I signed onto this one! https://t.co/2UY1DBc6KPThursday: Local &amp; national orgs will join me for a press conference on the administration's inexcusable treatment of unaccompanied children, from losing track of 1,500 minors to @HHSGov failing to conduct caregiver background checks.

#WhereAreTheChildren https://t.co/8c5INMCT1sThis weekend, #TeamGomez attended several #MemorialDay events to honor the sacrifice of our servicemembers.

We joined our veterans and families of fallen soldiers in Cypress Park, El Sereno, and at the Mexican-American All Wars Memorial at Cinco Puntos in Boyle Heights. https://t.co/3f3Lfr4feMMore than a million men and women have laid down their lives for our freedom.
 
On #MemorialDay, let us come together to honor their sacrifice. https://t.co/3xIsHelZCdWhen @RickSantorum plays down 1,500 missing children, calling it ‚Äúhyperbole,‚Äù what he actually means is that immigrant kids are expendable.

Typical of so-called ‚Äúcompassionate conservatives‚Äù to abandon concern for life as soon as the umbilical cord is cut.

#WhereAreTheChildren? https://t.co/uSYGNoIc9T#TeamGomez attended the MacArthur Park Tenant Rights Resource Fair today providing constituent services like #SocialSecurity assistance &amp; help applying for citizenship.

This great #FamilyFriendly event will take place again tomorrow (5/20/18) from 9am to noon at Lewis MacAdams Park. https://t.co/m572t4nLIIIt appears @HHSGov has lost nearly 1,500 unaccompanied minors. And the government doesn‚Äôt even know if they‚Äôve become victims of human trafficking.

How would you feel if one of these children were yours?

Why is this not a bigger story?

https://t.co/hTYNYkFCXo via @frontlinepbsTook part in #CarneYArena, a chilling #VR exhibit putting you in the shoes of a migrant captured by border agents while crossing into üá∫üá∏.

It‚Äôs an emotional experience that forces you to think beyond borders. I know a few @HouseGOP members who could benefit from such a journey. https://t.co/nJtkA46aK1Again, @HouseGOP stood in the way of my efforts to get @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs administration to reveal their motives behind adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census.

If you think @OversightDems will give up this fight, think again!

https://t.co/6ePVtVpbezMuammar Gaddafi‚Äôs bloodied body was paraded on the hood of a truck after his regime was toppled.

They‚Äôre making a concerted effort to terrorize our children. That‚Äôs not hyperbole. That‚Äôs reality.

@HispanicCaucus &amp; I have a message for @realDonaldTrump &amp; @BetsyDeVosED:

Pick on someone your own size! https://t.co/a2z8u7ic7xEfforts by @realDonaldTrump to compromise #2020Census w/ a citizenship question represent an attack on our representative democracy.

@OversightDems &amp; our constituents have a right to know the motivation behind such an egregious action. 

#EveryoneCounts

https://t.co/HdIKpeqe6RI like football as much as the next person, but here‚Äôs a thought for the @NFL:

#ProtectDREAMers https://t.co/kpu2zDm7V1I also submitted an #NDAA amendment commonly referred to as a ‚Äúsense of Congress,‚Äù expressing a strong opinion against reductions in US troops on the #KoreanPeninsula until üá∞üáµ ceases all hostilities against üá∞üá∑ &amp; achieves complete, verifiable &amp; irreversible denuclearization.Anyone who puts their life on the line to serve our nation deserves to be treated with dignity/respect, regardless of their immigration status.

2 of my #NDAA amendments would give these aspiring Americans the rights/protections they so richly deserve, w/o fear of being detained.We need to make sure our veterans have the resources they need after they return from battle.

One of the #NDAA amendments I submitted provides student veterans the opportunity to get an education while putting more üí∞ in their pockets to meet their needs/support their families.Letting schools report undocumented students to immigration enforcement officials is unconscionable &amp; wildly unconstitutional.   

Everyday, @BetsyDeVosED does or says something that underscores why she has absolutely no place serving in our government.

https://t.co/aQ5PJZMS0OThe opening of the Korean Legation museum speaks to the vibrancy &amp; resilience of the Korean American community.

Their determination gave us the opportunity to gather here today in Washington to honor the Joseon Dynasty &amp; their vision for a deep &amp; meaningful relationship w/ üá∫üá∏. https://t.co/kjBoZH9njk#HarveyMilk was a true champion and trailblazer for #LGBTQ rights.

As a @LGBTEqCaucus member, I take great pride in amplifying his message of hope and equality in Congress and beyond.

#HarveyMilkDay https://t.co/MA8uA4jTt5This citizenship question in the #2020Census was meant to scare immigrant communities from taking part in it. It was meant to silence their voices, pure &amp; simple.

@realDonaldTrump: If there‚Äôs a different motivation, send @OversightDems someone who will answer the damn question.Since the #VotingRightsAct was enacted 53 years ago, @TheJusticeDept has NEVER deemed it critical to include a citizenship question.

Feigning concern for #VotingRights while simultaneously attacking them is low, even for @realDonaldTrump &amp; @HouseGOP.

They‚Äôre not fooling anyone. https://t.co/Ih8buBnsRSI asked him whether the @TheJusticeDept had been unable to enforce the #VotingRightsAct without the data that comes with asking a citizenship question.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, saying @TheJusticeDept had been ‚Äúmaking due.‚Äù

That‚Äôs just absurd. @TPM explains why. 

https://t.co/IOW9U1SFPr https://t.co/oBcsfN5Q36My @OversightDems colleagues &amp; I wanted him to explain what prompted @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs administration to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census.

Simple question, right?

Mr. Gore refused to provide an answer. All he gave us was pathetic excuses &amp; a prepared statement.Thread:

Meet John Gore.

Mr. Gore is @TheJusticeDept‚Äôs Acting Assistant Attorney General.  

Mr. Gore isn‚Äôt a fan of answering questions, a sentiment that was on full display during Friday‚Äôs House Oversight hearing on the #2020Census. https://t.co/OTghXMeq3m#TitleX patients ‚Äì often low-income people &amp; women of color ‚Äì rely on @PPFA &amp; #ReproHealth centers for services like:

Meanwhile, @HouseGOP continues to hand billions of dollars to pharmaceutical companies under the #GOPTaxScam. 

https://t.co/yl5IQuIoq3I‚Äôm disappointed to see #SCOTUS side with corporations in this decision.

It‚Äôs a tough loss for #WorkersRights but the fight is far from over.

@HouseDemocrats &amp; I will never throw in the towel when it comes to defending #WorkingFamilies. https://t.co/1Lvks6cE6EI‚Äôll soon be sharing my #NDAA amendments w/ you. They tackle an array of issues including addressing foreign influence on the Trump administration, work-study wage standards for student vets, protections for immigrants serving in uniform &amp; peace/stability on the Korean Peninsula.Of course, I will ALWAYS choose peace &amp; diplomacy over military action. But every year, the #NDAA gives legislators an opportunity to add amendments that will improve the quality of life of our veterans &amp; address other vital elements to promote global stability &amp; security.Thread: In the coming days, you‚Äôll hear a lot about something called the National Defense Authorization Act or #NDAA. For those of you who don‚Äôt know what it is, allow me to explain:

The #NDAA is a massive bill directing üí∞ to @DeptofDefense for the military &amp; #NationalSecurity.Was I shocked to hear @realDonaldTrump call immigrants ‚Äúanimals?‚Äù

Not at all.

As I discussed today on @MSNBC‚Äôs @amjoyshow, such disgusting comments came from a man who started his presidential campaign vilifying immigrants, calling them rapists/criminals.

This is nothing new. https://t.co/1WBNAvSQAWThe so-called ‚Äúfamily values‚Äù party, led by @realDonaldTrump, thinks its ok to intimidate hardworking immigrants by threatening to take their children away &amp; warehouse them on military bases.

That‚Äôs not the America I know. Those aren‚Äôt American values. That‚Äôs downright inhumane. https://t.co/2hYmMBUTOAEarlier today, I joined my friend @MariaTeresa1 on @MSNBC‚Äôs @amjoyshow to discuss @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs shameful rhetoric about immigrants and his ongoing efforts to tear families apart.

Thoughts/prayers won't stop the violence. We need policy/action.Sadly, this #GagRule perfectly lines up w/ this administration‚Äôs ongoing efforts to control women &amp; dictate how they make decisions about their own bodies.

If you're not pissed off about this, you're simply not paying attention.

https://t.co/C2jFVPiWPbFederal law already prohibits @PPFA from using taxpayer üí∞ for abortions. 

So let‚Äôs call this what it really is:

An attack on @PPFA, #RepoRights &amp; reproductive healthcare organizations across our country.

So much for #LimitedGovernment...Let's be real: I seriously doubt @realDonaldTrump came up w/ this domestic #GagRule on his own. It reeks of @VP.

This #AntiChoice assault on women would bar healthcare providers like @PPFA from tapping #TitleX üí∞ if they provide abortions or even TALK w/ patients about abortion.Had a blast presenting at last night's screening of @VIDA_STARZ. Thanks to @STARZ for their investment in bringing this show to life &amp; for filming in my district at a location as authentic as #BoyleHeights.
