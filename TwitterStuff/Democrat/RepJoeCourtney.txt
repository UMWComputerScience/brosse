Great to see everyone at this morning’s legislative breakfast with the NE CT Chamber of Commerce in #Pomfret and have the opportunity to update our community leaders and small business owners on the legislative issues that directly impact our region. https://t.co/H8R6AzXko3The independent press, particularly local press, are a fundamental part of our democracy. I stand with the victims and survivors of the shooting at @capgaznews yesterday, &amp; the hardworking journalists everywhere fighting to uphold the truth #CapitalGazette https://t.co/VNJp7mrqTxThis bill addresses both issues of insufficient numbers of pediatric specialists &amp; the staggering #studentdebt many med school grads face by providing a student loan repayment program that incentivizes recent med school grads pursuing specialties to work in underserved areas.Average wait times to receive specialized care can exceed 29 weeks. For a family seeking care for their sick child, that wait feels like a lifetime. That is why, last year I introduced the Ensuring Children’s Access to Specialty Care Act of 2017. #SpeakNowForKidsThe health &amp; care of children across the US deserves a spot at the forefront of our efforts in Congress. This week I had a chance to meet with reps from @ctchildrens and @YNHH to discuss their efforts to ensure all children have access to high-quality specialty care.The Senate GOP rule to refrain from voting on an open @SCOTUS seat during an election year should apply in all cases of a vacancy on the high court, not just when it’s convenient for the majority party.Following the announcement of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement from @SCOTUS, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to stand by the “McConnell rule” and hold off on voting for any nominee until after the election and the new Congress is seated in January.Turning our back on the Americans most in need for accessible and affordable care is inhumane, and rolls back years of progress and advancement in our healthcare system. #ProtectOurCareThe @POTUS efforts to strike down #ACA protections for pre-existing conditions opens the door for insurance companies to discriminate against the 130 million Americans with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, mental health or addiction.Great to meet with Gardner family from #Norwich, here in DC with @YNHH for the @hospitals4kids Family Advocacy Day. Their family, along with dozens of others from across the country, are here to share their stories and voice their advocacy for children’s health #SpeakNowForKids https://t.co/VC9gOh95xiAll American workers, whether they belong to a #union or not see the gains when collective bargaining yields higher pay and improved benefits. Rebuilding unions is critical to rebuilding the middle class. #Janus sets us back but workers will prevail.The #Janus decision by the @SCOTUS will decimate public employee unions and overturns 40 years of established precedent. This is just another #GOP attack on middle-class families and the standard of living that unions once helped secure.Great news from @UConn &amp; @Interior with the recently announced $40K in federal funding for a maritime heritage trail. This CT Blue Trail will be a fantastic opportunity to engage and connect residents with the maritime community of eastern CT. https://t.co/01FPpggRsgI am a proud cosponsor of the #EqualityAct, which would expand current antidiscrimination laws to include sexual orientation &amp; gender identity. #LGBTQ Americans deserve equal rights, and the equal protections against unlawful discrimination.Three years ago, @SCOTUS established marriage equality as the law of the land and we should be proud of how far #LGBTQ rights have come. However, during #PrideMonth we must also recognize that progress remains to be made before we achieve full #EqualityForAll. https://t.co/krGPDxhH4RAs a member of @edworkforcedems, I remain steadfast in my commitment to building upon the progress made over the last 80 years so that every American worker can earn a liveable wageThis week marks the 80th anniversary of the #FairLaborStandardsAct, a landmark piece of legislation that laid the groundwork for the success and protection of America’s workers.I am proud to have worked on a bipartisan basis to finally get this long-overdue legislation passed in the House. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will follow suit &amp; pass the bill without delay so that our #BlueWater vets can finally receive the care &amp; recognition they deserveYesterday, the House passed the bipartisan #BlueWater Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, a bill I introduced that expands benefits for thousands of “blue water” @USNavy veterans living with chronic health conditions attributed to #AgentOrange exposure during the Vietnam War. https://t.co/lmNEMhcVbfThe improvisational, “on the fly” decision making by @POTUS has caused real harm to children and their families. These detained migrants, the staff, patrol agents at our border, and our country deserve better from our President.My colleagues and I visited #McAllen &amp; #LosFresnos, TX to witness firsthand the fallout from the #ZeroTolerancePolicy initiated by @POTUS last April. It’s plain as day that the immediate consequences continue to fester &amp; the fate of 2,000 separated children remains uncertain. https://t.co/gxzowFllveIt was my privilege this week to join as the third member supporting #HR950, which would designate the week of June 19th-22nd as National #GIBill Commemoration
Week, and pledge my continued commitment to upholding the promise of the #GIBill to today’s veterans.Today marks the 74th anniversary of the #GIBill, which provided educational support for 16 million veterans, helping to create a thriving middle class &amp; economic expansion for our nation in the post-war period. Signed into law on June 22 of 1944 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt https://t.co/6v70EdPdWqThe administration’s decision to join efforts to strike down protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions opens the door for insurers to deny them affordable care. This guarantees millions will lose their coverage or have to pay more. #ProtectOurCare130m Americans are protected under current #ACA regulation prohibiting insurers from discrimination against those with pre-existing conditions. @POTUS’s efforts to dismantle these protections endangers these millions of people, and their access to affordable care. #ProtectOurCareCongressional oversight of federal programs is a critically important role, &amp; one of the reasons why this trip is so important. Despite yesterday’s executive order, thousands of migrant children continue to live in uncertainty, waiting out an agonizing limbo. #KeepFamliesTogetherOn Friday, I will be traveling to the Texas-Mexico border along with several of my colleagues to see firsthand the federal immigration facilities where thousands of migrant children are currently detained. https://t.co/la34QHUwioGreat story by @thedayct on #BestBakerInAmerica winner Adam Young, offering us all a glimpse into the immense passion and effort behind #Mystic’s beloved Sift Bake Shop.  
https://t.co/W9t4wD2CGJThis #WorldRefugeeDay, I have joined as a proud cosponsor of @RepTedLieu &amp; @RosLehtinen’s HR 395, to reassert our nation’s commitment to the protection of refugees and the millions of displaced individuals from around the globe.Today is #WorldRefugeeDay, a critically important reminder of the millions of individuals across our globe who were forced by violence or fear to leave their home, &amp; who deserve a chance to breathe free. The US has a shared responsibility to help ease this global crisis.Today, I joined my colleagues on the steps of the Capitol to discuss the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, which would prohibit @DHSgov officials from separating families with few exceptions &amp; require procedure for families to locate &amp; reunite if they have been separated. https://t.co/XJgK8oI83II stand in full support of #Enfield PD &amp; Chief Fox in their initiative to address the #opioidepidemic through this pragmatic, yet compassionate approach.

Congratulations to Faiyhaa and her family! #BHMGreat to meet our CT-02 #BlackHistoryMonth Creative Writing Contest middle school winner Faiyhaa Saulut yesterday following her terrific reading of her winning poem “I am me for that is all I wish to be.” https://t.co/0IUhdshioHNotice an increase in unsolicited “robocalls”? Last year alone, the @FTC logged 3 million robocall-related complaints. Each year, the lack of an effective deterrent for phone scammers results in over $350 million in consumer losses.With a heat index exceeding 100 degrees in parts of CT today, it is important to know how to stay safe in the hot weather. Important tips include staying indoors or in cool, shaded areas and keeping hydrated. Stay safe, CT! #HeatWave
https://t.co/1U1tsYEvRiI am calling on @POTUS Trump to end his administration’s misguided policy that is separating parents and children on the southern border. Please take a moment to read my full statement on this heart wrenching issue. https://t.co/90ydmnHNZhAmericans with “pre-existing conditions” like mental illness and addiction are protected against discrimination from health insurers under current #ACA regulation. @POTUS wants to undo that, and leave thousands vulnerable to denial of proper healthcare. https://t.co/yz2jHx9O7oEven Trump supporting @nypost calls on @POTUS to reverse HIS decision to break up families. This disgrace must end. https://t.co/KGYgwS0FPnThere is absolutely no rationale that can justify the shocking trauma caused by ripping young children away from their parents and placing them into detention facilities like #CasaPadre. We are better than this.As this report from @CNN makes clear, the “zero-tolerance” policy that's separating children from the parents at the border is completely unprecedented in its size and scale. Many of the children taken from families are only weeks or months old. #CasaPadre https://t.co/fUEJxYiZtA.@POTUS’s flip flop on pre-existing conditions will undermine health care for millions of Americans. https://t.co/MULViLTtPk25 years ago today, President Clinton announced the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the #SCOTUS. She has been a tireless advocate for equality &amp; justice ever since. #RBG https://t.co/Q61V0aAoFXToday is World Blood Donor Day.

Thank you to our service members, veterans and fallen soldiers for your fight and sacrifice to preserve these values. https://t.co/J4wI1cckkMThis story serves as a sobering reminder of #opioidepidemic’s presence right in our neighborhoods. With 126 overdose-related deaths in #Norwich between 2012-2017, it's clear that more needs to be done to combat the grip this epidemic has on our communities
https://t.co/fi44xxD4ZmOpening the door for insurers to deny these patients care guarantees millions will lose their coverage or have to pay more. This decision by @POTUS cannot stand, &amp; I will continue to fight to protect all Americans from discrimination or denial of proper healthcare51% of Americans across the country and 53% of eastern CT residents have conditions that insurance companies could have used to deny them coverage before these #ACA protections. Among them are children, veterans, service members and senior citizens.Last week, @USAGSessions announced that the administration has joined efforts to strike down the #ACA’s protections for those with pre-existing conditions. This stunning announcement abandons existing law, &amp; would affect up to 133 million Americans https://t.co/ac3bfn7JAqGreat discussion with my Veterans Advisory Committee in #Enfield yesterday. These meetings serve as an important opportunity to discuss the priorities ahead for our veterans, including the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, which was passed out of committee last month. https://t.co/xkmLwBtC42Wonderful to spend the warm Saturday afternoon in #Killingly at the annual spring fest! Met some great local folks, stopped by many small business stands, and even picked up a delicious blueberry pie. https://t.co/XNZl8HNYQxGreat to see so many of our regions’ veterans at @QVCC’s 3rd annual Stand Down Resource Fair. This event always serves as an important opportunity for vets to receive benefit information, access free health tests &amp; screenings, explore employment opportunities and more. https://t.co/dV5axps0JBToday, we remember the 49 innocent lives lost to an act of senseless hate and violence at the #Pulse nightclub in June 2016. #Orlando, we are with you, and we have not forgotten. #NeverAgain https://t.co/7YyjJn5rH4Our discharge petition is ripe and ready for a vote and members from both sides of the political aisle support restoring this rule. Let’s protect consumers, let’s protect #smallbusiness, and let’s protect equal access to the internet by restoring net neutrality.Since the FCC voted to undo #NetNeutrality, I have heard from countless people across Connecticut who understand why this rule is so important for protecting consumers and maintaining open and equal access to the internet.Today, the @FCC’s misguided #NetNeutrality repeal officially goes into effect. I recently signed a discharge petition to force a vote on a resolution that would restore this rule. https://t.co/sVK87bi6S3China makes it crystal clear they are intent on challenging the U.S. in the undersea domain https://t.co/4sQEyWbxzf53% of eastern CT residents and 51% of Americans nationwide have pre-existing conditions. Opening the door for insurers to deny these Americans affordable care guarantees thousands will lose coverage. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/jAyL8lA0VCWhat started as 100 motorcyclists gathering in #Norwich to ride and raise money for vets has evolved into an impressive cross-state effort with up to 1,000 riders each year. The success is owed to #Norwich resident and @USArmy vet Charles Martin.
https://t.co/jNsAXTIGgEWith so much attention on mental health and suicide-prevention this week, I would like to remind everyone that help is a call away. If you or someone you know is suffering with mental illness such as depression, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-8255Americans with pre-existing conditions shouldn’t face
discrimination. It’s simple; all Americans deserve access to affordable care.
#ProtectOurCare https://t.co/ZlMvlj7EbyThe existing system leaves a gaping hole for law-breakers and scammers overseas to target consumers in the US. That is why I have decided to cosponsor @RepSpeier’s ROBOCOP Act that would require carriers to provide free blocking services.Consumers across the country are tired of receiving daily unsolicited #robocalls. Often, these calls are scams that seek to collect personal and financial information, proving to be both unsafe and a severe breach of consumer privacy. https://t.co/4GQFPGnoV8Although the #AirForceOne mission brings with it unique requirements &amp; challenges, a $24 million sole-source contract for refrigerators is hard to justify.This week, the @usairforce confirmed in a letter sent to my office that it has made the right &amp; responsible decision to cancel the previously announced $24 million sole-source contract to supply refrigerators for #AirForceOne. https://t.co/3LKlQBmIjJThe open-air burn pits used to dispose of waste &amp; trash in places like Iraq &amp; Afghanistan release open-air toxins that are dangerous to our service members.

Under the #GOPFarmBill, an estimated 2 million Americans would lose these critical benefits, and 265,000 low income children would lose their free school lunches.The long tradition of bipartisan support for the #FarmBill came to a screeching halt when the @HouseGOP proposed a $9.2 billion cut to #SNAP.Last week, the #GOPFarmBill failed in the House after facing bipartisan opposition. For decades, the #FarmBill, which provides aid for our nation’s farmers and funds nutrition assistance for low income families through #SNAP, has enjoyed strong bipartisan support.As #Parkland HS students said to #SantaFe students, ‘we shouldn’t have to share this.’ Time’s up, @SpeakerRyan.

Homefront is a community based volunteer program that provides free repairs to low income homeowners. https://t.co/IxykYgHRoKThanks to the hard work of an experienced caseworker in my #Enfield office named Karen, Katherine’s dedicated efforts to help our region’s veterans will continue unabated. Read her story here: https://t.co/IaZCJL6J4P #ConstituentCornerKatherine Kennedy has made it her life’s work to help families and veterans facing hardship. When she contacted my team in January, #TRICARE had stopped payments for her services because of an address change, but Katherine refused to turn veterans away.Last week, the House passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act, a bill I cosponsored that will lift the burden of storing nuclear waste from local communities like #HaddamNeck who, for over 20 yrs, have been unfairly saddled with the responsibility. https://t.co/XtwpV4ZuVUThe critical role that nurses play in our healthcare system can not be overstated. They are healthcare professionals, patient advocates, and a support system all at once. A big thank you to our region’s wonderful nurses for the difference they make. #NurseAppreciationWeekAlso had the chance to tour the greenhouses of @UConn’s @ecology department and meet with some of its brilliant faculty, staff and students.

Let’s keep the internet open and accessible to all users.Next week, the Senate will vote to save #netneutrality rules that were repealed by the @FCC last year. The repeal of these rules, which were created to balance open access to the internet &amp; low cost to consumers, was a deeply misguided undertaking to fulfill political promises.Sad news today of Eunice Groark’s passing. She served the state as LG with intelligence and dignity. A true role model of public service in a divided timeGreat to see the familiar faces of our eastern CT @MachinstsUnion members yesterday, here in Washington representing our region for the Machinists Union Legislative Conference.

Pat Conroy. Does @HouseGOP have to politicize even nonpartisan prayer? https://t.co/XA58hDFCooI am encouraged by developments on the Korean peninsula after #SouthKorean President Moon made a historic opening to the North Korea regime. While many details must be resolved, it was important to step back from the brink of extreme rhetoric and threats. #interkoreansummitHad the fortunate opportunity of attending the Soldier’s Medal presentation to @RepBradWenstrup this afternoon for his profound heroism and courage which saved the life of our colleague @SteveScalise.

Thats why I have introduced a bill that would offer coverage to #Medicare recipients who are in a hospital for 3+days, regardless of being designated as “admitted” or “under observation”#Medicare’s conflicting hospitalization rules can cost seniors thousands of dollars in medical expenses for skilled nursing care after a long hospital stay. A patient labeled as “under observation” rather than “admitted” will have to pay out of pocket https://t.co/QLfM2N6RUdEastern CT sub suppliers like @GDElectricBoat are gearing up for the increase in production and as ranking member on the Seapower &amp; Projection Forces subcommittee, I'm committed to ensuring they have the federal support required to achieve this ramp up
https://t.co/TwLzAKdMKAWith the U.S. attack submarine fleet expected to shrink by 20% over the next decade as older boats are decommissioned, it is imperative that Congress invest properly in our undersea fleet to ensure that our @USNavy has the resources it needs to boost operations.Great to enjoy this weekend’s sunny spring weather in eastern CT.

If you are a Vet looking for a home, contact Josh Salazar at the Norwich Vet Center to get more info on this opening. 860-887-1755. @middlesexhfhI am working hard in Washington to secure full funding for Impact Aid in the 2019 budget, so that schools in eastern #CT and across the country operating with limited local revenue continue to have access to the resources they need to educate our nation’s youngest generations.This morning I had the chance to visit Charles Barnum Elementary in #Groton, witnessing firsthand the importance of Impact Aid in our region’s public schools. This critical program serves as a tremendous benefit for the families of eastern CT federal workers &amp; military personnel. https://t.co/IhRJNG1KA9The @USDA has reopened enrollment for the MPP program to support our local #dairyfarmers after I led a bipartisan letter in February. While this is not a cure-all to the continued downward pressure on milk prices, this should help provide some relief. https://t.co/090YdCCOzQDredged materials require a safe and accessible disposal site. The @EPA’s designation of the ELDS has long been a priority of mine given how vital a disposal site is to eastern CT’s maritime economy and our national security.Joined today by @CTDEEPNews, @CTPortAuthority &amp; #NewLondon Mayor @MEP41 in support of the @EPA’s 2017 designation of the Eastern Long Island Sound Dredging Disposal Site (ELDS). https://t.co/HuAL65EFtq@TVCCAcares volunteers have helped veterans get many types of medical benefits, obtain military medals, and foster friendships. I'm beyond glad to have awarded the volunteers for their efforts. https://t.co/w43VkpKVotThe mission of the coffee house volunteers is to provide a comfortable place for all #veterans to meet, socialize, and receive information regarding veterans’ benefits and services. https://t.co/u4WST3TyPyYesterday I had the pleasure of hosting a THANK YOU ceremony for @TVCCAcares coffee house volunteers.
https://t.co/DPAlmrE3uPOn this day in 1949, President Harry S.Truman formally signed the treaty establishing NATO - the most powerful military alliance the world has ever seen. With 29 member countries and growing, #NATO seeks to maintain global peace through partnership and cooperation. https://t.co/3qhCGKmHTFIf you live in the second district and have a hankering for #americanhistory—you don't have to go far--just look in your backyard! Happy that the 334-year-old Leffingwell Museum in #Norwich will be opening for its 2018 season with a new exhibit. 
https://t.co/01lSGMzORs50 years ago today, we lost a great leader who inspired millions of Americans. We remember MLK not only for his profound words but for the example he set in leading the civil rights movement that would change our nation forever. We'll never forget #MLK and his sacrifice. #MLK50 https://t.co/X9p7Xkvjw5I am hopeful that with my fellow members of #congress, we will be able to bring more federal funding to early intervention and caretaking programs to better assist children and many others living with autism. #LightItUpBlueForAutismApril is #nationalautismawarenessmonth This month allows us to spread awareness and shed light on a growing condition affecting millions of families in our country.In 2017, my office returned over $622,000 to #veterans like Ernie through our casework program. There may be other veterans in our region who need help with obtaining benefits. If you or anyone you know is a vet who needs assistance, please call my Norwich office at 860-886-0139 https://t.co/IursKClqtnWhile Ernie was focused on helping fellow #veterans, my office assisted him with obtaining the VA benefits he had earned. My staff worked to get Ernie hearing aids with an approval for 60% hearing loss as well as his entitled #VA disability benefits.Ernest Maynard is a local #veteran from Enfield who served in WWII and the Korean War. I first met Ernie in 2015 when he requested assistance with obtaining Korean Ambassador for Peace Medals for local vets. Since then, we have presented nearly 200 of those medals to local vets. https://t.co/EAVbolw0UMGlad to announce that with the passing of the federal omnibus deal, #CT will receive a 29% increase in funding for the Care4Kids program. I am proud to have worked on a bipartisan basis to secure funds needed to foster the growth of our future generations https://t.co/PTySwHU7kEThe @EPA decision to roll back vehicle emission standards is irresponsible and disregards the preponderance of scientific data indicating that carbon pollution is driving global #climatechange. Reducing pollution is vital to protecting our health and preserving our environment.I will continue to urge my colleagues in #congress to work together to acquire continued funding for agencies like the NIH—one of the most important parts of a healthy lifestyle is staying up to date and informed on new developments in public health and medical research.The theme of #nationalpublichealthweek this year is #healtiestnation2030. With the recent passing of the bi-partisan omnibus deal, we were able to grant a $3 billion increase to the National Institutes of Health—which does vital work in biomedical and public health research.This week we recognize #nationalpublichealthweek. As co-chair of the primary care caucus, it is one of my priorities to ensure that the citizens of my district and my country follow a healthy and balanced lifestyle alongside getting an annual checkup with a PCP!With a bittersweet end to the NCAA women’s basketball tournament, I want to congratulate the @UConnWBB and Geno Auriemma on a hard fought season. We WILL be back next year for the chip! #bleedblue #uconnprideEastern Connecticut lost a great cop and a great person with the too-early passing of Steve Chipman. He spent 23 years with #Vernon PD and cared about every person he met. Deepest condolences to his wife Kate and two children. It was an honor to know him. https://t.co/chz64VYzaJOur hearts go out to the family, friends, and colleagues of the  Connecticut State Police trooper who was killed in a tragic auto  accident earlier today. My thoughts will be with the @CT_STATE_POLICE during  this difficult time.The IRS is sitting on $1.1 billion in unclaimed refunds for taxpayers who didn’t file a 2014 tax return, $12.7 million of which belongs to CT taxpayers. Special thanks to @rosadelauro for joining me to get the word out. More information at https://t.co/uDMwVQi1nK https://t.co/4jq6uhBGlLSpecial thanks to @RepEsty for joining me to remind CT taxpayers who didn’t file their 2014 returns that the deadline to do so is April 17th. For more information on how you can claim your refund, visit https://t.co/fwukvqtBJa https://t.co/TaUmwpUENS$12.7 million in unclaimed refunds for CT taxpayers who didn’t file in 2014 are due to expire on April 17th.

For more information on how you can claim you 2014 return, visit https://t.co/fwukvqtBJa. https://t.co/hRTdSnOGrNGreat to see #bipartisan action in Congress delivering important wins for the Connecticut economy. We were able to compromise and move past politics to fund crucial programs in defense,  public education, veterans affairs, and healthcare.
https://t.co/PwYZDixnD0After joining the student-led marches this past Saturday, I was proud to see young people demonstrating with a spirit of unity to show our nation that something must be done to stop gun violence #NOMORE https://t.co/FjwSeWkd0oWas glad to visit the Rockville Learning Center in Vernon and meet with Career Pathways Coordinator Michelle Vacharakupt. The center offers many job training programs like the ‘manufacturing pipeline’ program which can help residents obtain jobs at companies like @GDElectricBoat https://t.co/151rckUKdGWith the #opioid crisis continuing to grow in Connecticut and across the country, I worked hard to ensure that the bipartisan #omnibus spending bill included a $135 million increase to Community Health Centers to expand substance abuse treatment and mental health services.In addition to increased funding for submarine construction, I was pleased to let them know that my amendment was included in the final legislation which will now authorize the @USNavy to build up to 13 submarines in their next block contract being finalized this year.As ranking member of the #Seapower subcommittee, It was great to meet with the members of the Metal Trades Council and Marine Drafts Association to provide them with an update on the increased in shipbuilding funding contained in omnibus spending bill passed Friday. https://t.co/z7EccPY0zEHad a great visit to the Cornerstone Foundation in #Vernon yesterday with Shelter Director Brian Flint. The shelter provides assistance to the greater Rockville area through a soup kitchen, community center, clothing bank, and a youth outreach program. #communitystrong https://t.co/allGifCFoVGlad to hear that #CT will be receiving additional funds to combat potential election hacking by cybercriminals. I applaud @SOTSMerrill for her work in defending our democratic process.

Onto the #FinalFour again!This past weekend, our nation witnessed the power of our #youth voices firsthand. I had the opportunity to meet with students at Ledyard High school this past week to discuss many public policy issues that will have a profound impact on young people. https://t.co/K392Curr3YJohn also received a nomination for the @AF_Academy from our office on December 1, 2017, and was formally offered an appointment to the academy on March 13, 2018. Again, Congrats John! https://t.co/lFo5mt28HWI had the great honor of presenting the Congressional Silver Medal Award to local high school student John Burnett II on Friday.

Time for #GOP leaders to let House/Senate vote on gun violence bills. They will pass. #NeverAgain https://t.co/WlsxyiwJkfI am proud to stand with students today, and after seeing their grit and determination, I believe they are going to change the trajectory of this frustrating debate and bring about the changes that our society desperately needs. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain https://t.co/kROvzLf9N1I am truly inspired by the ‘March For Our Lives’ protests against gun violence taking place across the country and here in Connecticut. am proud to stand with these students today. #NeverAgain #EndGunViolence https://t.co/elPhqDossUFitness to serve in the military has nothing to do with transgender identity. @POTUS ban hurts military readiness and 50 generals and admirals are on the record saying so.We are a nation of laws, not individuals. Terminating the #SpecialCounsel, who has already secured convictions and indictments and has caused no rift within the Department of Justice with his actions, is totally unwarranted.I have added my name to legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller from being fired by @POTUS Trump without justified cause. Mueller is a Vietnam veteran, career law enforcement official, and former Republican-appointed director of the FBI. 1/2 https://t.co/11ds79AZUKAdded my name to legislation today that would protect Special Counsel Mueller. This is not about politics, but it is about the rule of law.Please note that my scheduled telephone town hall tonight has been postponed due to snowy weather. We will announce new session as soon as schedule permits. Stay warm and safe out there today.Thank you to Colonel William Conde and Janet Harrington, Chief of Programs and Civil Project Mgmt. Division, for making the time to discuss these important issues for eastern Connecticut. @CorpsNewEnglandI was happy to meet with the New England District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in my office today.

My deepest condolences go out to her family during this difficult timeThe families of our service members face extraordinary circumstances every day. Great piece by @JuliaSBergman in @thedayct on their daily sacrifice &amp; strength. https://t.co/Fa4SV0YNkx“We were born into a world reshaped by the Columbine High School shooting of 1999.” The high school students across the country who participated in #NationalWalkoutDay yesterday have grown up in a world of active shooter drills and deadly school massacres. https://t.co/mE7CW7UJOdAmerican middle-class families are struggling to afford the cost of sending their children to college. It’s time to take action so that the ticket to success - whether that be in the sciences, technology, engineering, or the arts - remains obtainable for young people. https://t.co/lfJkRzBfJ0I am heartened to see that students are speaking up and demanding that their voices are heard across the nation and in #CT at schools like Daniel Hand High School in #Madison. This is how real change always begins, with concerned (young) citizens speaking up. #EndGunViolenceNowHonored to present Richard C. Smith with a Korean Ambassador for Peace Medal &amp; Bronze Star yesterday, both earned while serving in the @USNavy during the Korean War, as well as thank him for his service to our country. https://t.co/g0pm7WVUN3Talk about a heavy #Nutmeg presence up north! #USSConnecticut &amp; #USSHartford broke through the polar icecap this weekend while representing the USA at ICEX. ICEX is a @USNavy exercise in the Arctic to evaluate submarine readiness with our allies from @RoyalNavy and other partners https://t.co/qikAoDV2dxAs a member of @edworkforcedems, I implore Secretary DeVos to meet with our committee and finally begin these critical discussions. It's time to demand better for our schools, and for our country’s future generations.It is outrageous that since her confirmation as Secretary of Education last year, @BetsyDeVos has yet to appear before the House committee on Education &amp; the Workforce to discuss any of the vital issues facing our nation’s public schools.The IRS has reported an increase in #taxscams this filing season. If you need help or want to report suspicious activity, please call the Connecticut Taxpayer Advocate at 860-756-4555 or visit their website at https://t.co/9bmy3OB9g0 https://t.co/LLuCBV2loA90% of America’s children attend public schools. @BetsyDevos’s inability to answer Lesley Stahl’s straightforward, policy-based questions about the direction she is taking our public education system reveals how unprepared she is to confront the issues facing our students.Had the opportunity to tour BNL Industries in #Vernon today to see firsthand the work that goes into making some of the critical parts used in submarines at @GDElectricBoat and other @USNavy shipbuilders. Great to witness this eastern CT powerhouse at work! https://t.co/6ay6oJ3JM3Congrats to Zack Adams and family for the meteoric success of @FoxFarmBeer in #Salem!

Vice Admiral Schultz has served our nation with dignity, and I am certain he will continue to do so in this new position.#USSConnecticut and USS Hartford are representing USA in the ICEX this year. ICEX, a @USNavy mission set in the Arctic Ocean to evaluate sub readiness, includes over 200 participants from the US, Canada, UK &amp; Norway. Heavy Nutmeg presence up north! https://t.co/zBRLu28mH6Since the @USNavy lifted its restrictions on women in submarines, female sailors &amp; officers have gone above &amp; beyond expectations, creating more opportunity for others to follow in their footsteps. Proud to have these submariners serving in our @USNavy. https://t.co/aJ9H5tVD1IThese devastating numbers serve as a grim reminder of how the #opioidepidemic deserves to be a priority- at both the state and federal level.The report also revealed the deadly driver that is fentanyl, with fentanyl-related deaths soaring to 677 last year, an astonishing juxtaposition to the 14 deaths in 2012. https://t.co/URbOKnmm2WImportant meeting today with @NorwichPD Chief Daley following the Chief Medical Examiner’s recent report of the state’s drug epidemic.

The proof is in the pudding. This tax law was not designed to benefit America’s #middleclass families. https://t.co/sGCp9ZYmSuThe #GOPTaxLaw’s massive tax cuts for corporations was sold to the American public as a way to create jobs and increase wages, promising #middleclass families a stronger economy to make up for an astounding trillion dollar deficit increase.TUNE IN: Catch our live Seapower subcommittee hearing at 2 PM to review the @USNavy’s FY 2019 for #shipbuilding. Watch here: https://t.co/3RPhRAq4RnThese workers often depend on tips for the majority of their income &amp; the @USDOL’s proposed changes leave a wide open gap for the possibility of deception and unfair distribution of tips.Last month I joined 123 of my colleagues in the House in signing a letter to @SecretaryAcosta opposing any rule change that leaves tipped-workers vulnerable to wage loss. https://t.co/S4o6Z0evGdChase G.
