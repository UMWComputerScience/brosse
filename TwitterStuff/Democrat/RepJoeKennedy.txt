The majority of Medicaid recipients work. So these misguided requirements aren’t about employment — they’re just another Trump tactic to make health care something only the rich can access and afford. Good news out of Kentucky today. https://t.co/Rplvcun0NPFor those asking how they can do more to help the families still separated at our border -- take a look at the guide below. Countless ways to contribute, get involved and fight back. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/w2Er6KvLDNDevastated by the news out of #Annapolis. Praying for the victims and those that loved them. Praying for action.No family should go through what they did. Thinking of Lidia and Diogo tonight. And the countless other terrified parents who still do not know when they will see their child again. May this story give us hope for the fight ahead. https://t.co/T774EBIFDVIf we can agree on anything, we can agree that refusing to tell a parent where their child is being held is inhumane. Plain and simple. I’m fasting because we cannot accept this reality on American soil. #BreakBreadNotFamiliesDouble check the name of the agency you run. Your job is to protect the environment. Not pave the way for corporations to dump waste in our waters. #BootPruitt https://t.co/TzJvAagWgHIf my grandma is willing to step up and fast to #EndFamilyDetention, you better believe you’ll find me right by her side. #BreakBreadNotFamilies https://t.co/RX0hoTpWs0Trump Administration is standing between children and their parents. GOP Congress &amp; @POTUS have both decided this isn’t an urgent crisis. We disagree and that’s why I'm joining the #BreakBreadNotFamilies fast today. https://t.co/EOZ5n5lPLqAutomatic voter registration helps strengthen our democratic process and gives voice to thousands of residents at the ballot box. Hopeful our Commonwealth will make a stand for voting rights today! #AVRAllowing insurance companies to discriminate against Americans w/ pre-existing conditions will take us back to a system that serves only the healthy &amp; wealthy. Tune in at 10am ET as I join @NancyPelosi &amp; @HouseDemocrats to speak out against this decision: https://t.co/S88TKP2jnQWhile I am deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision today, Congress now has an obligation and responsibility to clarify that denying entry to our nation based on religion defies the ideals that have always made us strong. #NoMuslimBanEverPresident Trump’s hateful rhetoric cannot be separated from his harmful policies. For all of the White House’s efforts to justify this #MuslimBan, @POTUS has emphatically &amp; enthusiastically detailed that his fear of one religion guided his decision. #NoMuslimBanEverLidia &amp; Diogo sought asylum after fleeing imminent violence in Brazil. Separated by our government, mom &amp; son haven't seen each other in nearly a month. Lidia was released but her son is still locked away. Diogo should be freed and reunited with her today. Period. https://t.co/xqNbcYBKz4We can welcome the tired, the poor, the yearning to be free – and still be free ourselves. If America can’t figure out how to amass the resources, courage, &amp; political will to ensure NO child suffers on our shores – who will? https://t.co/cFB0sJtGGcCutting food stamps for the hungry. Gutting healthcare for the sick. Slashing housing for working families. Failing to protect our students at school. Ripping children from their parents’ arms. Speaker Ryan, I’m CERTAIN you aren’t listening to the American people. https://t.co/tYNwauxISXOr taxpayers being asked to spend an extra $100 billion on a wall that @realDonaldTrump promised we wouldn’t pay for…
https://t.co/6eiC67pHHGMr. President, you created a harmful, hateful policy. You spent weeks lying to us about it while kids suffered. You tried to use those kids as political pawns. You finally admitted you could have stopped it all along. And thousands of kids are still separated from their parents. https://t.co/a51xwZ5oTRMight just be my cautious side but it feels like there could be unforeseen consequences like entire families being indefinitely locked in cages. Just my 2 cents.You might not know this about me, but I'm a white guy. And as a white guy, I would encourage @realDonaldTrump &amp; his fellow GOP white guys to consult a not-white-guy in their efforts to enact comprehensive immigration reform in less than 24 hours. https://t.co/EkmCux3NnmThree days ago, an HHS official told me I could not enter a taxpayer funded tent city that from all appearances was nothing more than a prison for children. And yet Speaker Ryan and House GOP have held ZERO hearings on this crisis. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/35ApNuoGn4Worldwide, there are 13 million displaced Syrians in need of humanitarian assistance. In the first 3 months of this year, the US had accepted 11 - or 0.00000085% - of them. On #WorldRefugeeDay we commit to do better. #RefugeesWelcomeWith today's passage of our CHIP #MentalHealth Parity Act, we can ensure kids, infants &amp; pregnant women covered by CHIP can't be denied the mental health care or substance use disorder treatment they need and deserve. https://t.co/7DPBribzqQThere is absolutely no reason for Congress not to pass @RepJerryNadler’s #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct tonight.

Either own it or change it. Scratch that - just change it. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/GxyzG1QrmZYour colleague Stephen Miller referred to this policy as “a simple decision.” You might want to let him know. https://t.co/GxyzG1QrmZCrossed Paso del Norte from El Paso into Ciudad Juárez after being turned away by HHS at the Trump Administration’s tent city in Tornillo. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/31MjVwSr0bThank you to the immigrants at the Annunciation House in El Paso who shared their stories and their strength with me today. We’re fighting for you. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/yaHEnbXWhKThis hateful policy needs to end. https://t.co/NkrHFDc6URArrived in Tornillo TX where first tent city for kids has gone up. Was refused entrance by HHS. Given amount of misinformation and conflicting info coming from Trump Admin, it’s critical that Congress and American public know exactly how these children are treated by our system.Not pictured: a stained suit, two crying kids, one crying Dad and a wife who somehow keeps us all together. https://t.co/gNBSkkk011I don’t care what you believe, who you vote for or what you think about the nuances of immigration reform. These kids need to be with their parents. That's it. That's all there is. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/4w79B3SxUA‘For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you made me welcome.’ Matthew 25. https://t.co/JBebPDF7guAllies help defend our country, fight for our values &amp; protect our citizens. Troops from those alliances are embedded with our brave men &amp; women around the world. @POTUS attempts to weaken G7 will pull our seat at the table out from under us — and cast American interests aside.In @realDonaldTrump’s eyes, brutal dictators get the benefit of the doubt but parents &amp; kids fleeing unimaginable violence don’t. Got it. https://t.co/JSCYiN6QmgOur Commonwealth has witnessed too many funerals for lives lost to the opioid epidemic. Thank you @MassAGO for holding Purdue Pharma accountable for being complicit in this crisis. https://t.co/mRdFnYyKLCScott Pruitt has done everything he can to enrich himself and his family. In most administrations that would be disqualifying. In this one, it’s celebrated. #BootPruitt https://t.co/nmixjqR6MLMeanwhile @realDonaldTrump &amp; GOP want to raise rents on affordable housing tenants, take away their health care and refuse to raise the minimum wage. https://t.co/3f2EOhBt19A President that saves his most lavish praise for brutal dictators while heaping scorn on our closest allies and leaving critical partners in the dark about their own security risks undermining peace and security for generations to come. (3/3)Unfortunately, President Trump has not only ceded American leverage and legitimized the North Korean regime, but empowered Chinese interests, dismissed human rights atrocities and brought us no closer to a complete, irreversible and verifiable denuclearization. (2/3)A denuclearized North Korea is a goal we all share. America must lead the way in pursuing dogged diplomacy, nuclear nonproliferation and global peace. The summit in Singapore had the potential to be a crucial step forward in that process. (1/3)Those fleeing war. Terrified children. Domestic violence survivors. All no longer welcome in Trump’s America. https://t.co/260xXjd6Xo“...the result is a brand of justice that seems un-American to many, unrecognizable in its deliberate cruelty.” https://t.co/Rkv9vOHTkeLet’s be clear. Substance use disorder is a preexisting condition. @realDonaldTrump, you’re abandoning patients in the grips of addiction and surrendering to the #opioidepidemic. Nothing else you do will matter. https://t.co/sky1jeG6vr@SPMiles42 You’re right.  Meant to vote yes — it was an honest mistake on my part.  There is no need for these weapons.  Keep up your advocacy @SPMiles42.I am the parent of a two year old little girl and a five month old little boy. But you don’t need to be a parent to be horrified by these stories.

Thank you MA State House for passing #ERPO bill and acting to end #gunviolence! https://t.co/IZbwwHc1klA reminder that the majority of Americans, Congress and (supposedly) @POTUS himself want a pathway to citizenship for #Dreamers. Speaker Ryan &amp; Leader McConnell shouldn't let the most extreme wing of their party hold these Americans hostage.A few months ago, @laurenkennedyMA &amp; I wrote an op/ed about the importance of CHIP funding. Today, House GOP is using children’s health care as a cheap stunt to try to regain their fiscal conservative label.

That’s why we must reject @realDonaldTrump &amp; @AjitPaiFCC’s efforts to control it. #SaveTheInternetUsing health care for low-income kids as a bargaining chip was bad enough. Using it for a PR stunt is even worse. And using it to pay for corporate tax cuts is unconscionable. https://t.co/sBCFKUf3KMAlthough the JCPOA is not perfect, its enactment was a critical step in keeping nuclear weapons out of Iran’s hands. Instead of ensuring vigorous enforcement &amp; accountability with our allies, @POTUS has damaged our credibility and commitment to our obligations before the world.A year ago, Speaker Ryan, House GOP &amp; @realDonaldTrump gleefully celebrated taking health care away from 23 million of our neighbors. Then they learned that their callousness was no match for compassion &amp; strength of American people.Under @realDonaldTrump &amp; GOP’s sabotage, 4 million fewer Americans have access to health care and his own former Cabinet officials are admitting he’s leaving patients with unaffordable costs. https://t.co/RUGAlHAMNXDismantling critical environmental protections.

(2/2)From rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges to strengthening our schools to expanding access to broadband, a substantive, equitable #infrastructure investment could unite a historically partisan Congress. (1/2)A man who doesn't believe our nation's promise of equality should apply to women, LGBT Americans or the wrongfully convicted cannot be trusted to be fair and just if handed a gavel. Kyle Duncan's nomination must be rejected by Senate. https://t.co/PUB8i7NuIlHeading to #Foxboro &amp; #Wrentham for our next #Tour34 office hours. Times and locations below - see you there!
- Boyden Library 10:30-11:30am
- Wrentham public safety bldg 1:45-2:45pmA few things @realDonaldTrump doesn’t “like or want” to invest in:
- Opioid epidemic
- Mental health care
- CHIP
- Community health centers
- Infrastructure 
- Education
- Disaster relief https://t.co/CYaJIP3LPLSame GOP Congress that passed an unfunded $1.5T corporate tax cut is now shutting down the government because they believe we can’t afford to confront the opioid epidemic or invest in our own communities.We cannot accept the indifference and indignity our Republican colleagues continue to show #Dreamers. Thank you @NancyPelosi for showing us all what it means to be a true public servant and leader. #GoNancyGo https://t.co/Wv0yq8D8woLet this be a reminder that using our health care system as a political hostage is not harmless. There are 27 million innocent bystanders left vulnerable by Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell’s failure to govern. https://t.co/711ikVRN7MAn extraordinary milestone for an outstanding organization. Thanks to the entire @CCA_Mass team for their commitment to our Commonwealth and their community. https://t.co/Q51X95WL0TThis is another manufactured crisis created by a GOP &amp; @POTUS determined to build barriers to health care underneath politically motivated distractions. #ValueCHCs https://t.co/AQ1X78gXKLHave a good luck charm in the green room, getting ready for #AMJoy @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow. Tune in! https://t.co/aJjnJLhOURMeanwhile the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans receive an extra ~ $3,000 per week. https://t.co/YFci8V5fnNThere are brave transgender servicemembers stationed abroad today willing to sacrifice their lives to protect ours. And this is how you thank them? https://t.co/r8IK1b4qZzInstead, Chairman Nunes chose to put politics before country and his own interests ahead of national interests. He is no longer fit to serve as Chairman.We are in an election year and the man in charge of defending American democracy refuses to even acknowledge the countless ways Russia has and is trying to infiltrate and undermine that sacred system. This makes Congressional oversight and independence all the more critical.Grateful for the kind words my friend. https://t.co/CzPiF0KBuPIt doesn't get better than Diman. https://t.co/Jrn2XnoIEpThank you my friend. https://t.co/kDEfrQK1bpIt was an honor giving the Democratic #SOTUResponse tonight. Thank you, God bless you and your families, and God bless the United States of America. https://t.co/0yAj5eahzb“Ladies and gentlemen, have faith: The state of our union is hopeful, resilient, enduring.” #SOTUResponse"Politicians can be cheered for the promises they make.  Our country will be judged by the promises we keep." #SOTUResponse“Bullies may land a punch. They might leave a mark. But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future.” #SOTUResponse“You leave loved ones at home to defend our country overseas, or patrol our neighborhoods at night. You serve. You rescue. You help. You heal.” #SOTUResponse“You bravely say, #metoo. You steadfastly say, #blacklivesmatter.” #SOTUResponse"You sat high atop your mom’s shoulders and held a sign that read: “Build a wall and my generation will tear it down.” #SOTUResponse“And to all the Dreamers watching tonight, let me be absolutely clear...You are a part of our story. We will fight for you. We will not walk away.” #SOTUResponse“And to all the Dreamers out there watching tonight, let me be absolutely clear: Ustedes son parte de nuestra historia. Vamos a luchar por ustedes y no nos vamos alejar.” #SOTUResponse“We choose the thousands of American communities whose roads aren’t paved with power or privilege, but with honest effort, good faith, and the resolve to build something better for their kids. That is our story.” #SOTUResponse“We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right.” #SOTUResponse“We choose pensions that are solvent, trade pacts that are fair, roads and bridges that won’t rust away, a good education that you can afford, and a health care system that won’t leave you bankrupt.” #SOTUResponse“We choose the living wage, paid leave and affordable child care your family needs to survive.” #SOTUResponse“We choose a better deal for all who call this country home.” #SOTUResponse“Here is the answer Democrats offer tonight: we choose both. We fight for both. Because the greatest, strongest, richest nation in the world shouldn’t leave anyone behind.” #SOTUResponse“As if the parent who lies awake terrified that their transgender son will be beaten and bullied at school is any more or less legitimate than the parent whose heart is shattered by a daughter in the grips of opioid addiction.” #SOTUResponse“We are bombarded with one false choice after another: Coal miners or single moms. Rural communities or inner cities. The coast or the heartland.” #SOTUResponse“They are turning American life into a zero-sum game. Where, for one to win, another must lose. Where we can guarantee America’s safety if we slash our safety net.” #SOTUResponse"Their record is a rebuke of our highest American ideal: the belief that we are all worthy, we are all equal and we all count. In the eyes of our law and our leaders, our God and our government. That is the American promise." #SOTUResponse“It would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. As partisanship. As politics. But it’s far, far bigger than that. This administration isn’t just targeting the laws that protect us – they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection.” #SOTUResponse“We all feel the fractured fault lines across our country. We hear the voices of Americans who are forgotten and feel forsaken.” #SOTUResponse“Like many American hometowns, Fall River has faced its share of storms. But people here are tough. They fight for each other. They pull for their city.” #SOTUResponseTune in right now on Facebook as I deliver the Democratic #SOTUResponse from Fall River: https://t.co/kB9dqy3oaoHead on over to my Facebook page to watch me give the live Democratic response to the #SOTU in just a few minutes: https://t.co/kB9dqy3oao #SOTUResponseNo kidding. https://t.co/84ZArQynptI’m here in Fall River at @dimanbengals watching the President’s #SOTU.

She will make our Commonwealth and our country proud at the State of the Union on Tuesday night. https://t.co/Y9PgbhZihxFrom health care to economic justice to civil rights, the Democratic agenda stands in powerful contrast to President Trump’s broken promises to American families. Deeply honored to be chosen to deliver the response to the State of the Union next week. Stay tuned for updates!For #NationalMentoringMonth, we visited @_OnCommonGround in #Attleboro which strengthens the community by connecting those in need with caring mentors. Learn more about their extraordinary work here! https://t.co/U5QWmaDtqaFrom defending Medicare and Social Security to ensuring access to transportation, our Commonwealth’s Councils on Aging are advocating for our seniors every day. Very informative to hear from them on the issues confronting MA’s seniors. https://t.co/QMSUdEodjuWe are not powerless to stop school shootings before they start. Devastated for the students we lost in Benton and for the parents and peers whose lives changed forever today.Community health centers like @ManetCommunity fill the gaps of a health care system that too often leaves too many without access to treatment. Congress must immediately provide them with the funding they need to care for our communities. #ValueCHCs https://t.co/dvHrWDJEZ3
