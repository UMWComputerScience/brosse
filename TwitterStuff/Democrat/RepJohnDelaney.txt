Journalists &amp; papers like the @capitalgazette make our democracy possible by keeping the public informed, holding those in power accountable and focusing on the truth. https://t.co/sXhq9dxUYuAbsolutely devastated by the shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis. Horrifying. I can’t imagine what the staff members and family members of the Gazette are going through right now. As we await more information, one thing is clear: we can't ever let this become normal.We should return to a 60-votes requirement for Supreme Court nominees, and if President Trump and Senator McConnell can’t meet that standard, then they should meet their own and wait until after the next election is held.For the good of our nation, President Trump should nominate a Supreme Court Justice in Kennedy’s mold of reasonable deliberation, and that is exactly what Senator McConnell, and the Senate as a whole, should demand.Upon reflection, it's clear that we really only have one option: to restore civility, judicial independence, and begin acting with integrity again. Sen. McConnell has an opportunity to do the right thing and make right his prior neglect for our democracy. He should do so.So now, we have before us a sadly familiar dilemma – how do we respond after so many norms of respect, civility and non-partisanship have been destroyed?In a single move, he exposed as hollow decades of his own rhetoric about his supposed belief in the institutional history of the United States Senate. At the moment of truth, he put party over country.Senator McConnell’s decision to ignore President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016 will go down in history as a shameless betrayal of the spirit of our democracy and of the purpose of the Supreme Court: to uphold the Constitution in an unbiased and non-political way.Delaney Statement on the Future of the Supreme Court  https://t.co/OOR5vxPAPBDelaney Votes for Bipartisan Defense Appropriations Bill  https://t.co/IIYUrvdrJIJust spoke on the House floor on behalf of my amendment to the Defense appropriations bill to increase funding for @FisherHouseFdtn.

Roosevelt signed the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the #GIBill, into law, providing much-deserved education, housing, and unemployment benefits to our #Military men and women upon their return from war. https://t.co/vA3arWsrNII’m proud to stand with my @HouseDemocrats colleagues to demand that our President #endfamilyseperation immediately. We have a moral obligation to stop this inhumane policy - which could be ended at any time by this administration. #KeepFamilesTogether #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct https://t.co/nfQ5x4mZxSShowing compassion and empathy doesn’t make us weaker – it bring us together. As Robert F. Kennedy said, “Our attitude toward immigration reflects our faith in the American ideal." #WorldRefugeeDay @RFKHumanRights https://t.co/9PjVt6cFjfThis administration has proven to be intolerant, inhumane, and cruel – and we must #keepfamiliestogether. I’m proud to be an original co-sponsor of the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct and encourage @SpeakerRyan to take it up immediately. @SenFeinstein @RepJerryNadlerOn #Juneteenth2018, the oldest known celebration commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, we remember the struggle African-Americans faced in their fight for freedom and renew our commitment to racial and economic #Justice. #EqualityForAllThis is deeply immoral and profoundly wrong.

I hope that the damage is not permanent and that this mistake does not undermine the hugely important negotiations with North Korea and our national security more broadly.By withdrawing from the JCPOA without an articulated go forward strategy to work with the international community to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the President has compromised that responsibility.A President’s most fundamental responsibility is to the security of the American people at home and abroad. One of the central challenges still facing the world is nuclear proliferation.The President missed a significant opp. to work with our allies to strengthen the weaknesses in the JCPOA and instead chose a misguided path that with either isolate the U.S. from our allies, accelerate Iran’s becoming a nuclear state, or lead to a military conflict w/ Iran.Delaney Statement on Trump Administration Decision to Withdraw from Iran Deal https://t.co/PsBFZWx0rsThe House is in session this week.
