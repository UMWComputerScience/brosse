We’ve gone from stopgap to stopgap w/o any meaningful attempt from Rs to work bipartisanly on a long term budget agreement.The American people sent us to Congress to work on solutions, but once again we are kicking the can down the road in a failure to govern. It’s our responsibility to vote on these issues and we should take them up one by one so the American people see where we stand.

Now it is time for the Republicans to work with us and bring up a clean long-term #CHIP reauthorization. https://t.co/6iHNKnHCMfAlong with my good friend Rep. John Lewis, we have introduced a national service bill to provide more opportunities for those who wish to serve their country through programs like AmeriCorps, SeniorCorps or FEMA Corps. 4/4 Read more here: https://t.co/xoRm633mKYLess than 1% of US citizens serve in a national service capacity. I believe in the spirit and legacy of Dr. King and understand that through service to one’s country we have the ability to strengthen the bonds that unite us. 3/4 https://t.co/d5b7WDN4UpI am reminded of one of his most succinct quotes. "The time is always right to do what is right”, and his famous call for the “fierce urgency of now”. There is always room for improvement and we can act on this through engaging our communities through service to each other. 2/4 https://t.co/57Sq9uV7sgToday we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s birthday by honoring his life through recognizing this day as National Service Day. Here’s a clip of the last speech he ever gave. 1/4 https://t.co/d94EuVMW4LThank you to everyone who came out to the town hall today to discuss the potential impact of the #GOPTaxPlan on CT. Big thank you to @RepJoeCourtney and to @MCC_CT! https://t.co/pQY2cEHbaATODAY @RepJoeCourtney and I are hosting a Town Hall at 2 PM at @MCC_CT. Hope to see you there! https://t.co/beci2X1uV4.@RepJoeCourtney and I are holding a town hall tomorrow to discuss the #GOPTaxPlan and the potential impact on CT residents. @cspan will be there, come join in the conversation. https://t.co/beci2X1uV4As we pause to celebrate the life &amp; work of MLK in just a few days, it is abhorrent that POTUS would use such vile &amp; unacceptable language. I fully condemn his remarks. His comments cont. to demean the office of the Presidency &amp; diminish the view of America all around the globeCMS announced states can now impose harsh work-requirements for #Medicaid, which goes against the core values of the program. 60% of people already work – this is an attack on #Medicaid. https://t.co/FhN2WaL9InHave questions about the #GOPTaxPlan? Join @RepJoeCourtney and I on Saturday at @MCC_CT for a Town Hall. https://t.co/beci2X1uV4GOP needs to stop stalling; ppl all across the country are suffering. Congress needs to address the following &amp; more

❌ Children’s health insurance funding
❌ Community health centers
❌ Aid for Puerto Rico &amp; USVI
❌#Dreamers
❌ Long-term govt funding 

It's time to get to workThe American people have spoken; they want to keep the #ACA. This year’s sign-up numbers from Connecticut are further proof. The GOP should be working with Democrats to strengthen the program, and stop trying dismantling it. https://t.co/mFUvbQcOTrHappy 230th Birthday Connecticut! https://t.co/ntEasf29NTMissed my newsletter’s End of Year wrap up? Read it here and sign up for my newsletter: https://t.co/Z2YxZ3g6RbLast night, @pbsnewshour interviewed the National Taxpayer Advocate about the uncertainty around the GOP tax law. It's troubling the IRS doesn't have the resources to handle questions from taxpayers wondering how this bill will affect them. https://t.co/jWH0KdUKFQ15 Hartford organizations agree that there is a way to reunite Hartford, recapture the Connecticut Riverfront, and repair our crumbling levees.

All of this, just to give tax cuts to the wealthy &amp; corporations. I will be opposing this cruel, &amp; unfair bill.Today we will be voting on the #GOPTaxPlan that has been rushed through, with no hearings, no regular order, and most importantly, no input from the American people. (1/2)ATTENTION: Open Enrollment ends this Friday, Dec. 22nd. Looking to enroll, or change your plan? Visit @AccessHealthCT today! https://t.co/gkiQFrl0UkICYMI, please read my statement on the recent decision by the @FCC regarding the roll back of #netneutrality https://t.co/XsRJjPxKgwThere is still one week to find the right plan for you and your family. Find your plan here: https://t.co/XJLIUZUlGr https://t.co/ndARZZ6pTAIn the last 5 years, it is shameful that Congress has done NOTHING on  sensible gun legislation. Thoughts and prayers aren’t enough to honor  the victims. Congress must act.On this day five years ago, 26 lives were senselessly cut short at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our hearts still ache. My heart goes out to the friends and families of all the victims. #SandyHook https://t.co/MfOq1FKFb6I signed a letter with 117 of my colleagues in support of #netneutrality urging the @FCC Chairman to delay the vote tomorrow. It is vital to preserve a free and open internet for all. https://t.co/xg06KtBElsDespite bipartisan support for #UniversalBackgroundChecks and closing a loophole on bump fire stocks, the @GOP Leadership refuses to let Congress vote. It is time to #HonorWithAction. https://t.co/ErYBkmMNNsWishing everyone celebrating, a Happy First Night of Hanukkah! https://t.co/Y3hYLeCQ12As @JimmyKimmel said, CHIP covers around 1 in 8 kids; 17k in CT. Instead of reauthorizing it, the GOP has been focused on their tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. I call on my colleagues in the majority to bring up a clean reauthorization ASAP. https://t.co/0NX2RLGZ0TThe #GOPTaxPlan will add over $1 trillion to the deficit, all to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations. They’ll cut Medicare &amp; other safety net programs to pay for it. https://t.co/U5h07aIHWBWithout #NetNeutrality big corporations could have an unfair advantage over startups and small businesses online. They deserve a level playing field. https://t.co/LLhbxlypolCT tax pros say #GOPTaxPlan is bad for CT in more ways than one. This plan would gut SALT deductions &amp; create more losers than winners. I will continue to fight this plan. https://t.co/pS0qm4mVJtFunding for #CHIP expired on 9/30. Instead of trying to find solutions for these issues, the GOP has instead focused on giving tax cuts to the wealthy/corporations. 17k children in Connecticut alone depend on this. I will continue to demand that we fund CHIP now.On this #PearlHarborRemembrance day, we remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country 76 years ago. They will never be forgotten. Their sacrifice inspired others.  Read 93 year old Jack’s story here: https://t.co/3KR7Z6cGVIIt was heartbreaking to hear from @NewtownAction&amp; each person affected by the scourge of gun violence this morning. Their stories are testament to the reasons why we must pass common sense gun laws so more families don't have to endure the pain of these tragedies #HonorWithAction https://t.co/Fihplnc3XzI want to thank the @NewtownAction &amp; Newtown Action Alliance for their tireless efforts concerning the plague of gun violence in our country. I will continue to fight on your behalf. My statement on the concealed carry vote here: https://t.co/dKQQ9PJv7fWelcome to Hartford, @StanleyBlkDeckr! https://t.co/V1vVa1pLQN@SamsPressShop @SocialSecurity Learn more about the bill here: https://t.co/9rGgvwXKE6 (3/3)@SamsPressShop The @SocialSecurity representative payee prgrm helps approx. 8 million people manage their benefits, if they are unable to do so themselves bc they are children or have a condition that prevents them from handling their own benefits. Our bill would strengthen this prgrm. (2/3)I wanted to share a bipartisan bill that I introduced as Ranking Member of the #SocialSecurity Subcommittee, alongside my friend Chairman @SamsPressShop. (1/3)I’m proud that CT has strong gun violence prevention laws. #HR38, would circumvent those restrictions &amp; allow those with permits from states with lax laws to legally carry a concealed weapon in our state. #OpposeCCROpen enrollment ends Dec 22nd – go to Access Health CT to see options for health insurance &amp; if you qualify for financial assistance. Here’s a video on picking a plan that’s right for you: https://t.co/UbpNduCnd4Tonight, I spoke on the House floor against the destructive $25 billion cut to Medicare that will go into effect next year if the #GOPTaxPlan is enacted.  Tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations shouldn’t be paid for on the backs of seniors. https://t.co/JcLbWpEsiLI fought in committee, I fought in the House Chamber and I will continue to fight this awful Republican tax bill. https://t.co/bSJrG0p1fmOutrageous Senate Republicans pass a tax bill that will raise taxes on the middle class to benefit wealthy &amp; corporations. @SenateGOP rammed this through bc they believe in a political win for themselves and not the country. https://t.co/Db2v52zwow#GOPTaxScam will raise taxes on middle class &amp; 13 million more Americans will be uninsured. This plan is bad for your budget and health.This #WorldAIDSDay, let’s remember those who have lost their lives to HIV/AIDS, and in their memory, continue to fight this pandemic. https://t.co/HCIHR196ZwCT’s middle-class will be ones who pay for the #GOPTaxBill.

“The nation’s Realtors say CT homeowners may lose as much as 10% of the value of the equity in their homes – and maybe more – if Congress approves a GOP overhaul of the federal tax code.”
