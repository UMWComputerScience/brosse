I join the @LouCoopers &amp; all @loucityfc fans in saying we’re sad to see Coach Byrd &amp; Coach O’Connor go, but we’re so very proud of their time here in Louisville. Pulling for a big City win tonight to send Daniel &amp; JOC off right. #LOUvNYProud to be among the hundreds of Louisvillians taking to the streets to make their voices heard today. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/7VxyETap5aMy statement on today’s ruling to block @GovMattBevin’s  @KentuckyHEALTH1 plan that would eliminate coverage for tens of thousands of Kentuckians: https://t.co/pvjw2kM9LMGlad to join the Middletown Chamber of Commerce for their monthly luncheon today. Great conversation on health care, DACA, campaign finance reform, and partisan gridlock in Congress. https://t.co/8hPOlJy0ysFor Trump, McConnell, Ryan and others, hypocrisy is not a problem, it’s a principle. It’s not a sin, it’s a strategy.It was great meeting with you and your family, Luke! Thank you for the important work you’re doing. Come visit me anytime. https://t.co/UZjdoVgawuThrilled to welcome @atherton_high grad Emily Aycock &amp; her father to DC to see her artwork hang in the @uscapitol halls.

They put tax breaks for millionaires ahead of ensuring that surviving military spouses receive the benefits they were promised.Truly disgraceful. A majority of @housebudgetGOP members just voted to defeat my amendment to help Gold Star families &amp; surviving spouses. Instead, they protected tax breaks for big corporations &amp; millionaires. You have to see it to believe it. https://t.co/Y5DGgpd629 https://t.co/247gNBhLwnLIVE NOW: The House Budget Committee is meeting to consider the @HouseGOP's extreme budget proposal: https://t.co/Sz7GbioY4uToday @HouseBudgetGOP are considering their “Budget for a Brighter American Future,” which makes extreme cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, education, infrastructure, and other critical programs in order to pay for the #GOPTaxScam. Brighter yes, but for billionaires only. #GOPBudget https://t.co/ZMFKz44yEgI'm proud to introduce the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act with @RepJerryNadler and 190 @HouseDemocrats.

President Trump could end this crisis with one phone call. He refuses. Until he acts, we'll work to force this administration to end this cruel practice.

https://t.co/psfr2MSJOGThis Juneteenth we’re reminded that while physical shackles may have been removed, the fight for civil rights &amp; equality continues today. I join with Louisvillians recognizing this important day and will continue to commit myself to the goal of greater freedom for ALL.President Trump could make a single phone call and end this heartbreaking ordeal today.The Trump administration’s cruelty is on full display as we watch families being torn apart and children left suffering at our border. To be clear: this is a new policy being implemented by this administration as part of its continued assault on immigrants and immigrant families.As we celebrate this day, our hearts are with the families who have been ripped apart at our borders, those who have risked their lives in pursuit of life and liberty, now enduring an unfathomable nightmare at the whim of this administration.I’m lucky to be spending Father’s Day with my son Aaron. So blessed.One day the @NRA will no longer exist and we’ll all be better for it. Until then, I’ll continue to tell the world just how proud I am to have an F-rating from these monsters.

Congress should get to vote on these sensible gun safety measures. https://t.co/dC548WiE7UDozens of Americans will lose their actual best friends to gunfire today alone. Tens of thousands will lose their best friends this year because of the free flow of firearms that @NRA promotes and the predictable violence that follows. #NRAIsNotYourFriend #NeverAgain https://t.co/dC548WiE7UMuhammad Ali never sought a pardon and never had to. He fought for justice and got it. @realDonaldTrump, you can honor the Champ by knowing the facts of his life before speaking and learning from his life of unity &amp; peace rather than division &amp; fear. Ali built bridges, not walls.Say what you will about Trump, he sure is loyal to the country that elected him. https://t.co/7Lw4gvLi3yhttps://t.co/vummwkNNZwWhat an amazing morning. I had the privilege of spending this 74th anniversary of D-Day at the WWII Memorial with a group of 62 WWII veterans from KY. Heroes. All of them. #DDay #HonorFlight https://t.co/TmXWdSByPTThis is the cost of @realDonaldTrump’s reckless trade policies. Tariffs from Mexico on bourbon and bacon. Mexico is Kentucky’s fifth-largest international trading partner for exports. https://t.co/QdR89Tb69WExcited to welcome my new daughter-in-law Sarah Tate Yarmuth into our family. Congratulations @yarmuth and @tatesm09! https://t.co/AEctoBydn3Of all the ways Trump has damaged our country, his unraveling of our moral fabric is maybe the most tragic.

So what’d the company do once it became law? Bought back $700M in stocks, fired 800 workers, &amp; opened a plant...in Thailand. This is the #GOPTaxScam at work. https://t.co/iYojTxr4aw@syimonphilipp Call Claire in my DC office and we’ll see what we can work out during your visit. 202-225-5401@syimonphilipp What time will your group be here?

He was a true public servant, an inspiring leader for Louisville, and simply an incredible person. My heart breaks for his family. https://t.co/ssNEZCSzlpThe internet doesn’t belong to @realDonaldTrump and @AjitPaiFCC, but their work to end #NetNeutrality shows they think otherwise.

Looking forward to working closely on issues important to this great University. #GoCardsGreat to visit with the students of @StMaryAcademy before my flight back to Washington today. Go Monarchs! https://t.co/QErBawsBdhSo long as unrest is met with bloodshed, cries for peace ring hollow and hopes for a better future in the region will remain nothing more than a dream.I remain a strong supporter of Israel and the two state solution and urge both sides, the Palestinians and Israelis, to cease the senseless violence.The disingenuousness of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s claim that the new U.S. Embassy is any part of a “pursuit of peace” is exposed by the Israeli soldiers meeting expected protesters onsite with gunfire at close range.We are witnessing the use of unabated brutality and force against civilians to stifle civil unrest. America must expect and demand more from its close allies.I am deeply saddened by the horrific slaughter of at least 52 Palestinian protestors and injuries to thousands more by Israeli forces. No doubt this will spark claims that Israel has a right to defend itself — and it does. But this has nothing to do with defense.Wishing a very Happy Mother’s Day to my mom Edna, my wife Cathy, and all the moms out there who inspire us as much as they have encouraged us our entire lives. https://t.co/HVP2su1lzGIt’s always wonderful to have students from Louisville visit the @uscapitol and see where our laws are made &amp; how government works.

These sharp kids told me to keep guns out of schools, support their teachers when other elected officials won’t, and run for president. I promised them I’d do 2 out of 3. https://t.co/XXGYwkz5lIIn Kentucky, the top 5% of earners will receive 61% of the state’s #GOPTaxScam tax breaks. This law was in no way written to benefit middle class workers. #HappyTaxDay though.The #GOPTaxScam will increase our deficit by $2.3 trillion dollars and Republicans want to pay for it by cutting vital programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. #HappyTaxDayUnder the #GOPTaxScam, 13 million more Americans will no longer have health insurance. #HappyTaxDay87% of Fortune 500 companies have announced no plans to share their #GOPTaxScam tax cuts with their employees. #HappyTaxDayThis Tax Day, my Republican colleagues are heralding their #GOPTaxScam law, which *RAISES* taxes on 86 million middle class Americans while a company like Pfizer pockets $218 million more *A WEEK* under the new law.

Though he announced his retirement today, he still has nine months left with the gavel in his hand. He’s not off the hook.Today is #EqualPayDay, marking the day when women’s wages catch up to what men were paid the PREVIOUS year. For women of color, that gap is even larger.

An attack on teacher tenure was tucked into the pending Senate budget plan.

Thank you @ByckElementary, @AudubonPTA, @BlakeElementary, @HolyTrinityLou, @slslou &amp; Louisville Classical Academy for helping to honor our heroes this Valentine’s Day! https://t.co/LF2Gd9CmG9I will vote to support the bipartisan budget agreement when it comes to the floor. Here’s why: https://t.co/2XAPY6TsSsGreat to meet with @ksbanews representatives visiting the @uscapitol today during their annual legislative conference. https://t.co/uFOSSSmJEUPresident Trump essentially called the 65% of Americans who disagree with him traitors. I’m proud of the company I keep. https://t.co/zWv0VayMUvMy statement on President Trump’s State of the Union address: https://t.co/QFRTw3Qg8V@uofl I’ve enjoyed spending the day with Leo. We’ll be heading down to the House chamber in a couple hours. #SOTU https://t.co/jeB2A9QH7ZLIVE: Proud to stand with DREAMers from across the country here at the @uscapitol as guests for tonight's #SOTU address. I'll be joined by Leo Salinas Chacón, a @uofl student and DACA recipient who came to the US from El Salvador when he was 3 years old. https://t.co/ekmRffburMI’m thrilled to welcome Leo Salinas Chacón, a @uofl student and DACA recipient, as my guest for next week’s State of the Union address: https://t.co/x4BVBF73b1My statement on today’s Senate agreement to temporarily fund government operations through February 8th: https://t.co/ANMYBRlTGAI guess this is a pretty small investment for billions in tax savings. Is the swamp drained yet? https://t.co/uEvuP1xGdcMy Louisville and DC offices are open and our phone lines are up and running. Casework involving other government agencies may be delayed due to the shutdown, but my staff and I are continuing to do all we can to assist constituents.@Nofearnofavors4 Please contact my office at 502-582-5129.Sorry I can’t make it to the Louisville Women’s Rally today. Stuck in DC, but there with you in spirit. If you’re in town, the rally is at 3PM at the @AliCenter. Show the world the power of Louisvillians fighting for change.My statement on tonight’s #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/HzD0ZilhzAQuit demonizing innocent young people who are making great contributions to our country in order to divert attention from Republican failure to operate the government. https://t.co/00TumfBondToday, I introduced a Constitutional Amendment that would get big money out of politics and give power back to the people. SuperPACs, corporations, and special interest groups shouldn't have more power than the American voter. Read more about it here: https://t.co/v1o5TtuO3FTrump told reporters he was the least racist person they’ve ever interviewed. Only way that’s true is if it’s their first day on the job or they’ve spent their careers embedded with the KKK.Honored to join so many from throughout our community to recognize and celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. King at King Solomon Missionary Baptist Church today. #MLKDay https://t.co/MBKDavITxXSo if @GovMattBevin's Administration drafted any provision of their waiver in a way that doesn’t meet legal standards, the Governor will punish more than 500K Kentuckians by taking away their healthcare, while he keeps his. Not exactly fair or reasonable. https://t.co/c2jGqoc5wL@GovMattBevin took exception to me calling his Medicaid waiver dangerous. If he thinks 95,000 Kentuckians losing their health care isn’t dangerous for them, he needs to give us his definition of safe.The Trump administration just approved @GovMattBevin’s dangerous Medicaid waiver request for Kentucky. My statement: https://t.co/KfS8CeMzTq https://t.co/K8ERqG93IXPresident Trump’s insult of Haiti and predominantly non-white countries is intolerable and unacceptable anywhere, especially in the White House. Reprehensible. I call on @SenateMajLdr and @RandPaul to denounce @realDonaldTrump’s disgusting comment.My statement on @realDonaldTrump's decision to approve work requirements for Medicaid coverage: https://t.co/D9BfPufFkwThe overwhelming wish to protect Medicaid is shared by the young, the old, and everyone in between. All age bracket agrees. POLL: https://t.co/z2P2UsTa6U https://t.co/yWqaKkOz6CAnd this isn’t a regional thing. A majority of people from every part of Kentucky agree. Medicaid must be protected. POLL: https://t.co/z2P2UsBzfm https://t.co/7Bjf3oOEEdA majority of Kentucky Democrats, Independents, and Republicans agree. Medicaid must be protected. POLL: https://t.co/z2P2UsBzfm https://t.co/adfKStc72WThe numbers are in. The people of Kentucky overwhelmingly REJECT @GovMattBevin’s plan to undermine Medicaid and take life-saving coverage away from tens of thousands of our fellow residents. POLL: https://t.co/z2P2UsBzfm https://t.co/U0pnmtuB1HThis morning, I joined @cspanMcArdle on @cspanwj to discuss budget priorities, the looming government shutdown, and more. Watch here: https://t.co/nQ8rTVl1wwWith all of the talk regarding the President’s fitness for office, I wanted to share my @leoweekly columns from May and August of last year discussing just that.

Trump's grave danger to us all: https://t.co/64mJUHvLL5

The sound of one hand clapping: https://t.co/5d6AtPcP1CEnjoyed speaking with @AlexWitt on @MSNBC this afternoon about continued concerns over President Trump's fitness to serve and the possibility of bipartisan compromise on border security and DACA. https://t.co/Iqpj5cfyR1Thanks for all you have given Louisville and best of luck in the NFL, @Lj_era8. For three years, we got to watch you defy gravity &amp; physics up close. I'm one of many who will cherish the thrills and spend the rest of my life trying to figure out how on earth you did those things. https://t.co/ohdUKKt4QiIt’s important that we have an honest discussion about @realDonaldTrump’s mental health and his fitness for office. I discussed this topic earlier today with @KatyTurNBC on @MSNBC. https://t.co/R3mbZSQ74vPOTUS took credit for lack of airline fatalities last year (8th year in a row), despite no changes in policy. Georgia and Alabama bowl wins must be next.Saddened to hear of the passing of Sue Grafton, native Louisvillian and fellow @atherton_high grad. Her outstanding work and kind spirit will be missed.POTUS said Tuesday he was going back to work to MAGA. He’s played golf every day, making America great again DIVOT BY DIVOT. https://t.co/dKEtIMa0lrWishing you and your family a wonderful holiday season, a very merry Christmas, and a happy New Year.Great to join @GigiStoneTV on @MSNBC this morning to discuss President Trump's latest blunders on tax reform, health care, and more. https://t.co/QbB064zi2aGovernment is about choosing. Congressional Republicans chose poorly. https://t.co/q9m8P4lZ5TMitch just can’t stop giving gifts to billionaires. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/bP4nkH8EI8Here’s the gift Republicans gave to their corporate donors in their #GOPTaxScam bill.

What’s NOT in your wallet? https://t.co/SIJVnM0079Today, the @HouseGOP will once again vote to pass the #GOPTaxScam. It’s an insult to our democracy. https://t.co/pr1VvPdJFrToday, Republicans sold their souls and principles to give tax breaks to wealthy corporations and their millionaire donors. #GOPTaxScamLive stream of @HouseGOP doubling down on their plan to raise taxes for tens of millions of middle class families: https://t.co/KxNFRVrDPQ #GOPTaxScamGrateful for the opportunity to meet @AdyBarkan and thank him for sharing his story and his fight to defeat the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/1EbQqFzxDZThe city of Louisville is on their feet as well. Great to see @teddyb_h2o healthy and back on the field. https://t.co/8wVJwSIQzDIt was wonderful to spend time at @svdplou’s Ozanam Inn Men’s Shelter tonight, delivering hundreds of holiday cards made by local elementary school students for Louisvillians who will spend this holiday season in our city’s homeless shelters. https://t.co/QTJVCvN73UToday is the FINAL day of Open Enrollment for coverage beginning in 2018. Head to https://t.co/Abnc0WDAmW TODAY to find affordable care for you and your family. #GetCoveredLou https://t.co/N92zpBv2zJThe American people—both Democrats and Republicans—overwhelmingly oppose the @FCC’s decision and support a fair and level playing field on the internet. Congress needs to act. #NetNeutraltyUnder these revised rules, a handful of big corporations will now have near complete control over the internet, with the ability to pick winners and losers among small businesses and decide what content consumers can view or create online. #NetNeutralty@FCC I have heard from thousands of Louisvillians who rightly and vehemently oppose this decision.The @FCC's Republican majority just voted to kill critical #NetNeutrality protections put in place during the Obama administration. This is a dark day for supporters of a free and open internet.Today, we remember the 26 young children and educators killed at #SandyHook five years ago, and the 170,000 Americans who have died since as a result of gun violence.

“Thoughts and prayers” will never be enough. We owe them ACTION. #HonorWithActionThere are only 2 days left to sign up for coverage for 2018 during Open Enrollment. Head to https://t.co/Abnc0WDAmW and find affordable care for you and your family today. Open Enrollment ends tomorrow. #GetCoveredLou https://t.co/ne1r6YUAbM.@SenateMajLdr held open a Supreme Court seat for over a year to play politics. Now he wants to rush #GOPTaxScam through to deny a democratically elected senator the right to vote on it. This bill impacts every American &amp; every American deserves to be represented in this debate.Happy Hanukkah! Wishing you and your family peace and happiness during this festival of lights.Responding to allegations of sexual misconduct by trying to publicly shame yet another woman, the president has shown us exactly what kind of person he is. Donald Trump has proven to be a poison for the presidency, a cancer on the country, and a truly disgraceful human being. https://t.co/vwpIayYVbdToday, we remember the 2,403 American lives lost in the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, including this Louisville native and the inspiring story of his young life cut short: https://t.co/3OTtZm6yujLooks like @SenateMajLdr’s explanation of the #GOPTaxScam gets an “F” from my colleague, former school teacher @RepMarkTakano. Try harder, Mitch. https://t.co/PXEsibMIkHCongratulations to @duPontManual student Shreeya Arora on winning the 2017 @CongressionalAC App Challenge for KY’s 3rd District. Check out Shreeya’s app to help first responders here: https://t.co/V8hga75LK6Great to join @CarolHLN today to discuss the next steps in the #GOPTaxScam that jeopardizes the future of lower and middle income families in order to give the wealthy and big corporations a huge tax cut. https://t.co/fe5SBfmcMeToday I joined @VictorBlackwell on @CNN's @NewDay to discuss the latest on the #GOPTaxScam, the government funding fight, and the Russia investigation. https://t.co/yCkMle2yQiWith all but one GOP Senator supporting Trump’s tax scam, the myth of Republican fiscal responsibility died today. The American people are onto this scam, and Congressional Republicans on both sides of the Capitol would be smart to listen to them. #GOPTaxScam 4/4There is nothing American or responsible about increasing our deficit by a trillion dollars, jeopardizing the future of Medicare and Medicaid, or forcing working families to pay more for healthcare, homeownership, and higher education. #GOPTaxScam 3/4There is nothing remotely responsible about forcing through a closed-door, hastily conceived bill to give tax cuts to the already wealthy and multi-national corporations. 2/4Early this morning, Senate Republicans abdicated any claim they had to being the party of fiscal responsibility. #GOPTaxScam 1/4Open Enrollment for coverage in 2018 will end on Dec. 15. There are 15 days left, so head to https://t.co/Abnc0WDAmW TODAY to find an affordable health care plan for you and your family. https://t.co/DJVyEd5UnVGreat to join @VonnieQuinn on @BloombergTV today to discuss the latest on the GOP’s tax scam and the possibility of a government shutdown. https://t.co/MOWH2Icq2nThe GOP tax bill is a scam on the middle class and is rife with special interest loopholes that hedge fund managers will love. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/4gGYQ29awsI fully support @NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer on this. @realDonaldTrump wants to negotiate by tweet, starting with insults. Sad. https://t.co/XoC2FJZ3MVWishing all of you a very Happy Thanksgiving. I’m thankful for my family, my friends, and the honor of representing the best Congressional District in the country.The GOP's tax plan is a massive giveaway to the wealthy and a scam on the American people.

#ForTheCity, For the Cup! https://t.co/0k0yEpl4EIGreat to join @AlexWitt on @MSNBC this morning to discuss the latest on the #GOPTaxScam and other issues: https://t.co/bgf3vxjCM4These heroes have given so much for our nation, and we need to do far more for them. It is our sacred responsibility.And we must invest in programs to properly address the mental health crisis that results in 20 veterans taking their own lives each day.Not just today, but every day we must work to advance veterans’ priorities — including health care and access to services at our VA hospitals, new career opportunities, and support for military families.Today we honor our nation’s veterans, thank them for their dedication and sacrifice, and pledge to uphold every commitment made to them for their service.Today, Rep. @louiseslaughter and I welcomed health and environmental experts to the Capitol for a briefing on the dire health risks associated with mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia &amp; our @ACHEACT bill. The American people deserve access to CLEAN air &amp; SAFE drinking water. https://t.co/qEBAQI3XDjCurious how you’ll fare under the new #GOPTaxScam? @realDonaldTrump and his administration are telling us all we need to know. Here’s his Chief Economic Advisor: https://t.co/eSPKjfdqGwThe #GOPTaxScam raids programs that the American people rely on in order to give tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and corporations. https://t.co/TPAEye54EG#GOPtaxbill rips tax relief away from people suffering from diseases like cancer &amp; Alzheimer's. #billionairesfirst
