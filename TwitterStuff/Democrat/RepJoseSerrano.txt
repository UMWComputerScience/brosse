Feliz día de las Madres Dominicanas. Deseándoles todo lo mejor en este día.Farrell was special. A great legislator who respected everyone’s opinion and worked with all. From day one he was a leader respected by all. Those were difficult days for our state and Denny was part of finding solutions. My condolences to his family.  R.I.P my friend &amp; colleagueDenny Farrell and I were part of the 1975 NY Assembly freshmen class. We became friends and like other members of that large newly elected group he became a colleague I looked to for advice. He had been involved in government and politics longer than the rest of us.Angelo Falcon made us aware of so many issues related to the Puerto Rican diaspora through his writings and analysis. His opinions on the issues in our community were respected by the media, elected officials and scholars. His fight for justice will be missed.

Puerto Rico’s colonial status has always put the island at a great disadvantage when dealing w/ the federal government- but here it had tragic consequences #6MonthsAfterMaria https://t.co/yhCUENQHoVThis @Politico article goes deep into what we already knew: @realDonaldTrump responded more urgently in #Texas than in #PuertoRico after hurricanes Harvey &amp; Maria. Congress must conduct hearings to further investigate why this happened &amp; why it decided to help some American...I will be offering an amendment in the #AppropriationsCommittee to prevent funds from being used to include such a question on the 2020 Census or to print anything with this information included.We need everyone in our country to participate in the Census to properly allocate federal funds to local communities nationwide, including #TheBronx. The inclusion of this question would have repercussions that last more than 10 years.Including a citizenship question in the #2020Census is unnecessary, unsupported, &amp; a clear attack on communities already living in fear under @realDonaldTrump's Administration.@CommerceGov Secretary Ross’ decisión to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census wil only result in a low count and fear. The question is another way to push for a low &amp; unfair count. I will  present amendment to undo this language. @uscensusbureauAmericans want action to #EndGunViolence. In fact, 97% of gun owners want to see Congress require background checks for all gun buyers.

The @GOP’s inability to fund our govt. for the long run is affecting our military &amp; veterans. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/FkYOmWOUsTWant to understand what the #TrumpShutdown means for American families? Here’s some info on what the last GOP shutdown meant for our economy. https://t.co/ujnXU6R40CAmericans know Republicans own the #TrumpShutdown. Anyone claiming otherwise should double check who has control in Congress. https://t.co/QTLuhWB0bdHe told us he was the great deal maker. Well, with republican control of the White House, the senate and the House —what did he give us? The #TrumpShutdown in addition to hateful comments, tax breaks to the rich and an attitude that says it’s his way or no way.A #GOPshutdown will slow even more @fema recovery efforts in #PuertoRico &amp; #USVirginIslands. It will delay approval &amp; distribution of already limited funding for long-term projects to rebuild the islands. @GOP is once again showing it doesn’t care about #PuertoRico.#Republicans are afraid of their most extreme elements- putting partisanship and extremism ahead of common sense, compromise, and the needs of our country #GOPshutdownRepublicans control the House, Senate, &amp; White House.  @HouseGOP @SenateGOP have refused to work with Democrats, and are now leaving town without a solution.  Can’t even get basics of government right #GOPshutdownI also voted against the @GOP #ContinuingResolution because it does not address the needs of #PuertoRico &amp; the #USVirginIslands, where many homes are still without electricity &amp; disaster assistance badly needed.  American Citizen still suffering- and @GOP doesn’t care.Last night I voted against the @GOP's inept attempt at running our country w/ another #ContinuingResolution. They refuse to address the over 800k #DACA recipients who are losing their legal status to work every day.

After letter sent to Congress, @dhsgov told IG that they were reviewing &amp; would have an answer next week. But Congress shouldn't have to fight to release #muslimban report. We need to shine light on this shameful effort not let the Trump Administration bury legitimate criticism#4
@dhsoig letter also says they found:
2. @customsborder followed court orders at ports of entry and didn't engage in misconduct, but in several instances violated court orders in telling airlines to deny boarding to individuals from affected nations at foreign airports.#3
@dhsoig also gave general findings of report, including:
1. @customsborder was given no warning on issuance of the #muslimban or its scope. That meant they had no guidance and no idea how to implement it or answer basic questions about it- especially for LPRs.2 @dhsoig had conducted a thorough review and written a report &amp; submitted to @dhsgov for comment on 10/6. Later told that agency was considering using 2 different types of privilege to limit report's release w/no timeline for a decision. So @dhsoig sent a letter to explain delay#1
This past February, I led 38 Democrats in asking @dhsoig to examine problems and abuses in @cbp implementation of the #muslimban. Today we got an extraordinary &amp; troubling response@hsoig had conducted a thorough review and written a report &amp; submitted to @dhsgov for comment on 10/6.

It targets Medicaid, Medicare, ACA subsidies, and many deductions that people in #TheBronx rely on. https://t.co/wnKofMpdXY.@TaxPolicyCenter analysis sums up the #GOPTaxScam perfectly.
