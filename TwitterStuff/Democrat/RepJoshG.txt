You can read more about my plan below.I voted against partisan proposals to end Medicare as we know it, lower the cost-of-living adjustment and reduce Social Security benefits, and I voted yes on the Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act to improve oversight &amp; protections for SS recipients.In Congress, I have worked for the Fifth District by fighting to strengthen Social Security and help New Jersey seniors, and I will continue to defend Social Security and Medicare. I am committed to protecting these vital programs for New Jersey. https://t.co/e5E2J4dR1LThis new bipartisan legislation will make sure schools see red flags in real-time ‚Äì within 24 hours ‚Äì to help remove dangerous school bus drivers from the road ‚Äì immediately.

This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue; it's an American issue.

Children should never be held hostage from their parents.As a country, we cannot sit idly by as children are torn from their parents' arms. Doing so violates our values, costs American taxpayers millions, and does not make our communities safer.I joined members of the New Jersey delegation on both sides of the aisle in calling on leaders of the House Natural Resources Committee to reject a proposed bill that would punish states like New Jersey for preventing offshore oil and gas drilling.I met with Wantage and Vernon high school students Tyler Shorr, Nick Thomas, Evan Poust, John Kappelmeier, Sam Dupont, and Robert Wallace, here in the Capitol as part of @NRECANews and @SussexREC's annual Youth Tour.

Wishing you all joyous celebrations filled with family and food. #EidMubarakI'm continuing to fight for a more a more aggressive attack on China's strategic theft of our intellectual property, including advancing CFIUS reforms to protect our national security &amp; jobs.But the work's not done yet. Many great NJ &amp; US companies continue to face the serious threat of sweeping tariffs on their goods. We must stand up to China's intellectual property theft &amp; do everything we can to make &amp; buy goods here in the U.S., but we need a targeted approach.After calling on the @USTradeRep to exclude @SnowJoe's innovative snow blowers &amp; electric snow shovels from the proposed sweeping tariffs this past Tuesday, I was thrilled to see these products removed from the list of tariffs announced this morning. https://t.co/kpVNoGEJh4Hope you can join me this Saturday at my Cup of Joe with Josh Town Hall!

Thank you to North Jersey faith leaders for joining me to discuss programs like the nonprofit security grant that help protect our communities from hate crimes, bias &amp; the ever-growing threat of homegrown, ISIS-inspired lone-wolf terror. https://t.co/XspQsqkUZXDoing so is critical to allowing great New Jersey and American companies like Snow Joe continue to thrive and create jobs. And most importantly, they can continue to make these jobs and products here in the Fifth District.That's why I wrote to the @USTradeRep to exclude Snow Joe products from the proposed tariffs and hold more comprehensive hearings on the impact of these tariffs on jobs and companies staying in New Jersey.We cannot allow strong, innovative employers like @SnowJoe to fall victim to well-intentioned tariffs that accidentally harm our own innovative companies. https://t.co/B7nMpEQ3gKThe only sports betting I did today was wager @RepMullin I could do more pushups during our bipartisan workout.

I lost. https://t.co/aP6zWgfZmII'll continue to fight for our doctors, patients, researchers, and companies, for policies that encourage growth and innovation. Ensuring access to quality care isn‚Äôt a Democrat or Republican issue, it‚Äôs a Fifth District issue. It‚Äôs a mom and dad issue. And it‚Äôs a Jersey issue.And with more than 78,000 life sciences jobs in New Jersey, it's the key to creating new jobs and growing our economy.Proud to receive the Champion of Health Care award for my work to cut costs that hinder medical innovation, like the medical device tax. Innovation is absolutely essential to getting families in the Fifth District &amp; across the country the quality medical care they need &amp; deserve. https://t.co/PvrFzvDe51Trying out some of @SnowJoe's fantastic products at its new facility in Mahwah, set to open in July and bring 150 new jobs within the first year #MadeintheFifth https://t.co/1j8ZOimwsjI was honored to present Jersey veteran and hero Corporal Gerald Platt with the World War II Victory Medal, the Army of Occupation Medal, and the Honorable Service Lapel Button for his service to our country during World War II. https://t.co/MkPycQc5DrMazel Tov to Chabad of Northwest Bergen County on 18 years of strengthening our community, leading by example, and imbuing our lives with warmth and spirit. https://t.co/r89vx8lery.@RepLanceNJ7 and I are working across the aisle to protect Warren County's natural treasures. https://t.co/maTw6kgS8XI had a great time speaking to students, families, small business owners, community leaders, and members of Newton‚Äôs Police Department, Fire Department, and EMS at this year‚Äôs Newton Day Festival.

These accidents highlight what we already know to be true: we must do more to protect our kids on school buses. https://t.co/JVGpgwmSaKFor 14 years, the Eid Committee of New Jersey has helped foster a sense of understanding and respect by bringing together members of our community for a Grand Iftaar.

We must continue walking out and speaking up for common-sense gun violence prevention measures such as outlawing bump stocks, because now, more than ever, we must keep on fighting to keep our schools, children, and families safe.Together, we supported specific, common-sense legislation to enhance school safety, improve background checks, and fund mental illness research, all of which were passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and signed into law.I‚Äôm proud that, earlier this year, the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus came together to overcome the traditional partisan divide on this issue.To honor #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, #TeamGottheimer wore orange and attended events at Upper Saddle River's Liberty Park and Ridgewood's Van Neste Square. https://t.co/ekHAP0WXHAProud to join with @SenatorMenendez in the Senate and @RepJohnFaso in the House to introduce bipartisan, bicameral legislation to do everything we can to ensure every child in America is as safe as possible when they‚Äôre on the road. https://t.co/cx3l0p3eOcThanks to Congregation Beth Abraham in Bergenfield for hosting #TeamGottheimer at its 23rd Annual Dinner.

I'm proud to have introduced the New Jersey Tax Cut Plan, which, less than four months after it was introduced, was signed into law @samanthamarcus @johnsb01 @njdotcom https://t.co/MtXC21lWzeThe risks of inaction are too high.Iran must know that its destructive behavior throughout the Middle East will not be tolerated, and we must now work to ensure that the world‚Äôs leading state sponsor of terrorism is never able to threaten the United States or our allies armed with a nuclear weapon.There should be nothing partisan about our national security, nor our relationship with our ally Israel.With the decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, we must now move beyond partisan gridlock and implement a comprehensive plan to better restrain Iran's malevolence and nuclear ambitions.Beginning in October, the President declined to certify that the sanctions relief under the JCPOA is 'appropriate and proportionate' to the measures Iran has taken to terminate its illicit nuclear program.But even if Iran were to fulfill all its obligations, the sunsets in the JCPOA would still permit Iran to resume its nuclear program within years.Iran has violated international law by testing long-range ballistic missiles and transferring weapons to terrorist groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas, and Iranian proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.Since the deal‚Äôs implementation, Iran has reaped the benefits of sanctions relief, twice skirted the agreement‚Äôs limitations on heavy water, and continued to flaunt its refusal to allow international inspectors access to military sites under the JCPOA‚Äôs weak inspections regime.It also failed to address Iran's aggressive development of long-range ballistic missiles to deliver these nuclear weapons. These facts remain true today.I opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, because while it may have placed temporary limits on certain aspects of Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, it did not permanently preclude Tehran‚Äôs pathway to the bomb.Great to meet with New Jersey dentists and dental students from the @AmerDentalAssn and discuss the great steps New Jersey dentists are taking to educate patients on opioid abuse and offer non-opiate alternatives @NJDentalAssoc https://t.co/qVTxSDJlABThis past week, less than four months after I introduced the plan back in Fair Lawn, the NJ Tax Cut Plan has been signed into law.
