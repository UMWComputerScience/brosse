I joined my colleagues in introducing the Family Unity Rights and Protection Act to reunite families torn apart by the President's cruel policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pVaQjZ6eWcSCOTUS delivered a devastating blow to working people in America. Unions are quintessentially American and critical in the fight for fair wages and worker protections. Today’s decision is disappointing and its consequences will be damaging for workers across the country. #JanusSalmon recovery is economically and culturally important to the country. The House adopted my amendment to H.R. 2083 to ensure that salmon recovery efforts are rooted in science by studying the effects of lethal takings of sea lions on the recovery of salmon stocks.Today, the Supreme Court upheld discrimination. President Trump's Muslim Ban is un-American, it does not make our country safer, and it will forever be a shameful stain on our nation's history. #NoMuslimBanEverVoting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, Americans want the full freedom to vote back. Today, I’m urging Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act. https://t.co/LsnaMguNn1We must understand how virtual currencies are used to facilitate drug &amp; sex trafficking.

They should set their political games aside and get to work with Democrats to get things done for the American people.
