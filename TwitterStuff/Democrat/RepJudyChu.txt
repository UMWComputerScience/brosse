#TBT to my trip to a family detention center in Dilley, TX

The ridiculous Trump/Ryan bill failed spectacularly yesterday. Now it's time to pass REAL immigration reform that stops treating children as prisoners

#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pJLAReItOVOne of these pictures shows a threat to our democracy. The other shows immigrant children who want to participate in it. A strong leader could tell the difference.

#KeepFamiliesTogetherWe've already seen what a Trump court means: legal discrimination of Muslims, making it okay to deceive women about their healthcare options, and taking power away from workers. 

This next nominee will determine a generation of rights for us. The stakes couldn't be higher. https://t.co/Qdoai3DiAzUnions have empowered millions to stand up to abuses from employers. And whether nor not you've ever paid a cent in dues, you're likely safer and paid better b/c of a union. I'm determined to fight for our workers by rolling back #JANUSvsAFSCMEWhen opposing the forced separation of parents and children is considered "fringe", I pity the center. https://t.co/Ufwd1Eh0LTBefore the ACA, Hannah’s family was one of the many who had to choose between paying for medicine or paying their bills. Her mom would even have to rely on her daughter’s insulin because they couldn’t afford another prescription. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/OGKjzLViAj“I’m here alive and well thanks to the Affordable Care Act.” Thank you @OlaOjewumi for sharing your story. Without the ACA, the drugs Ola needs would be unaffordable. This is why we must #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/f4FkgMTNM3Don’t harass Trump administration staffers at restaurants. Instead, sing the national anthem so they have to spend their whole meal standing.It's heartbreaking that lands reserved for the public for permanent preservation were instead handed over to mining companies for short term profit.  

Our environment is our birthright. We should be working for the next generation not oil companies. https://t.co/DnjHnUBjPRIt's ok to give women incomplete or deceptive information about their healthcare, according to the Supreme Court. 

I'm incredibly concerned by today's ruling on crisis pregnancy centers which allows them to intentionally mislead women about their reproductive choices #EndtheLiesThree years ago today, the Supreme Court declared that #LoveWins with their ruling to allow marriage equality. 

I'll never forget that day, the celebrations, and most of all, the #Pride https://t.co/qf4CT0OsEmBanning somebody from this country because of their religion  may be legal (for now), but it will never be right.

Holder, it's time to #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/6jQo6EKVsr‘I Can’t Go Without My Son,’ a mother pleaded as she was deported to Guatemala. Mothers and fathers unable to recover their children is just one cruel consequence of Trump’s heinous family separation policy.  https://t.co/L9UHOaWTRy

#KeepFamiliesTogetherEach of you has the ability to make a difference, just as @RyanForRecovery did when his friend Tyler died while recovering from addiction. Ryan saw something wrong, reached out to my office, and together, we wrote and passed a bill to solve it. 
https://t.co/PXCjaTcVwnIn a Congressional hearing, @SecretaryRoss told me the #citizenshipquestion was added to the #2020census because DOJ initiated it. 

In a memo yesterday, he confirmed Commerce initiated the request. 

I demand to know the truth.  

https://t.co/1vJ4ReWu9QMelania Trump is a former model who is deliberate about what she wears. She has also proven to have expensive taste and wouldn’t just throw on a $39 jacket. The message was cruel and callous.

https://t.co/sXfCBSV2r9Charles woke up in the middle of the night w/ severe back spasms. But it turned out it was actually a seizure. He was rushed to the ER &amp; diagnosed with a brain tumor. 3 days later: brain surgery, followed by radiation. W/out the ACA, it would have bankrupted him. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/vq7fRKkCfxQ: What should mothers expect when they're reunited with their children?

A: A host of health challenges, developmental delay, regression of speech, and other trauma. 

Perhaps revelations like this are why Republicans won't hold a hearing on their family separation. https://t.co/Lj9VUYrhPwFrom the @USChamber: Under the Trump-backed anti-immigrant Goodlatte bill Republicans brought to the floor today, California would be expected to lose as much as $21,868,000,000 in 2028. 

It was never about the economy, it's always been about keeping immigrants out. https://t.co/3lGV2SmzUnAt the height of the civil rights era, we changed our immigration laws to be based on families, not race. Now, Republicans are trying to change even our legal immigration system all to make America white again.

#KeepFamiliesTogether
#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Di3gCW4vDDWhen Republicans aren't separating families at our border, they're busy separating them in our laws. Tomorrow, we're voting on the partisan #GoodlatteBill which guts our LEGAL and family-based immigration system. The result of this is more family separation. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/lTHSWroA79We’ve gathered on the steps of the Capitol to introduce the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, a bill to force Trump to stop the child abuse at our border. Although he could stop the abuse any time he wanted. https://t.co/JqgalLmkKcTo be clear: this means innocent children have suffered permanent trauma for weeks while the President and his Republican allies lied to the public that this was beyond his control so he wouldn't have to take responsibility. https://t.co/71tPki3jrKI’m joined today by Jose and Alcides who are standing up for children just like them who have been torn from their parents by Donald Trump. #KeepFamliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/wgxPrqMg7wSuccess!

The powerful claim to follow the laws, but don't apply them fairly and instead use them to discriminate. https://t.co/pBxyPHZUOtThe irony here is that the Jews who DID escape Germany were turned away from the US by the exact same policies being pushed by this administration. https://t.co/oUVkpksWbR"They could be gang members" is the 2018 equivalent of "they could be Japanese spies" argument used to imprison innocent Americans in WWII.

#FamiliesBelongTogether 
#KeepFamiliesTogetherWe're on the ground getting the facts about immigrant families being torn apart. What we know so far: There is no law requiring this. It can be stopped at any time. And the policy is traumatizing children. https://t.co/hUziwq0q7ZJust left a shelter where 65 immigrant boys separated from their parents are held. These refugees are fleeing gang violence, but Trump's DOJ just changed the rules so gang violence is no longer a basis for asylum. Instead of helping, he calls them criminals. #KeepFamiliesTogetherHere is his admission: Trump and Stephen Miller's anti-immigrant policies were never about law or the economy, they're about making America white again. 

Our culture and our economy were built by immigrants from all over the world. https://t.co/jxloJ8liJrTruth: There is no law saying this. Separating children and parents is Trump’s own cruel policy. He can end this today. https://t.co/277uHxzs7f#KeepFamiliesTogether 

https://t.co/ZGevvnJVx6Instead, it separates those who legally cross the border by cutting family visas.

#KeepFamiliesTogether #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/AQkkfdeAuGThis disgusting separation of a mother from her child while breastfeeding is why we protested at Customs and Border Patrol and the White House.

Next stop the White House. https://t.co/66Q0RrJYKzWe’re going to march to the Customs and Border Patrol offices to demand an end to the cruel practice of tearing parents from children. Even if they arrest us, we will not back down until we get answers. #FamiliesBelongTogether #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/VLNd5kVSm3I'll be there too.

https://t.co/RQMn3p0E2mVoting is our most powerful weapon. That's why, throughout our history, the powerful devised new ways to keep the powerless from gaining access to the polls. 

Today's #SCOTUS ruling moved us further towards restricting access when we should be expanding it.Trump's lawsuit to weaken the #ACA will not only mean higher rates for people with pregnancies or cancer, it will raise rates for everyone as it weakens the markets.

Tyler's home didn't even have narcan on site, which can counteract an overdose. 

Ryan said that's like refusing to put lifeboats on an ocean liner.Recently, Ryan's friend Tyler, also struggling with addiction, died of a heroin overdose while in the care of a sober living home.For ten years, @RyanForRecovery struggled with an addiction to heroin. On Thursday, he testified before Congress. https://t.co/eaqnF6n2PsThread: I want to introduce you to an incredible constituent of mine: Ryan Hampton. https://t.co/ZkG3MWfwR3Our founders included the census in the Constitution so we could have an accurate understanding of our population.

But on March 9, the final day before going out on his own, Officer Casillas was shot in the line of duty.

And while everybody should dream, there are only some Dreamers that you're threatening to deport, whose dream you want to end. 

We all dream. We all de serve a chance at the American Dream. https://t.co/ALATrTuWYdIf Devin Nunes is going to use his position to protect Donald Trump instead of protecting our people, laws, and national security, then he doesn't deserve the position. #RemoveNunes https://t.co/hNzQSS55JpMy thoughts are with all of my colleagues in the train accident today. I'm grateful for the doctors who immediately rushed to help and will be hoping for a safe return for all.24 hours later, this holds up. Trump agitated against immigrants and proposed policies that take us backwards, not forwards. For all the talk of the flag last night, he obviously doesn't appreciate the values and the history it represents. https://t.co/dPPq2CuocxDespite the splashy, one-time PR moves by already profitable companies, Trump's #taxscam is not going to help most Americans, unless they were already rich. What he left out in the #SOTU: we're paying for long-term tax cuts for the rich. 
https://t.co/ZRQRsaBiRXBecause it's not true. A single immigrant cannot bring in an unlimited amount of family members. There are no visas for aunts/uncles/cousins/grandparents. And some need to wait decades to reunite with one family member. ONE family member. #SOTU https://t.co/2dpjxwdMRMBefore you get started, Mr. President, let me stop you right there. It's family immigration, not chain migration. #SOTUOf course Americans are dreamers. There's a name for the phenomenon. And the best part is that anybody can achieve it. Don't use one person's dream to rob another of theirs. #SOTUHere comes the Stephen Miller portion of the #SOTUOh finally. A plan for something. #SOTU https://t.co/pO8VMDPYGqTrump has not implemented one policy to achieve any of the unemployment numbers he is touting. #ThanksObama #SOTUIn my seat and ready for Trump to take credit for Obama’s accomplishments and then make promises he has no intention, plan, or ability to keep. #SOTUDon't https://t.co/hmjWeU9h3v#Dreamers are here to stay. Unlike your hate, which doesn’t belong here at all. https://t.co/tzuv1JopYjWe want Donald Trump to see the faces of these #Dreamers. And we want him to know they should not be used as leverage to end the family reunification system. That juat trades one family’s pain for another.I’m proud to stand with my guest to tonight’s #SOTU, Jung Bin. He has lived his whole life here and just asks that he not be deported to a home he never knew. Here, he has roots and a future and, like so many others, he deserves his shot at the American Dream. https://t.co/lJEjVrJfl1These are the brave Dreamers that President Trump wants to deport starting March 5. Tonight, they will be our guests at the #SOTU. Watch our press conference live to hear their stories: https://t.co/MTTRXLXRjl https://t.co/YcklmHDwcNWe’re wearing black to tonight’s #SOTU in solidarity with the women whose voices have been silenced and careers hampered by sexual harassment. We’ll be silent no longer. Women are equals, not objects. And #TimesUp for sexual harassment and discrimination. https://t.co/EcjOO4KiiGAnybody can read a prepared speech off of a teleprompter. That's not presidential. Presidential is being truthful, compassionate, unifying, and forward looking. Trump has never been any of that. I'm less focused on his words tonight than his actions tomorrow. #SOTUTrump's immigration policies aren't based on security, rule of law, or economics. They're based on white nationalism. As I told @KatyTurNBC on @MeetThePress today, the President's own words &amp; actions have shown he is trying to take us back in time to make America white again. https://t.co/EQSOiR2rNYMeet Jung Bin, my guest to the #SOTU and an undocumented immigrant who, thanks to DACA, was able to work, save up some money and graduate from college. I’m proud to have as my guest such a dedicated young man. I hope Trump sees him and the reality of who #Dreamers are https://t.co/oghvq8fTcTWhen @RepLindaSanchez &amp; I told Gen. John Kelly that "chain migration" is an offensive slur, he dropped the term for the rest of the conversation. It's time we do that nationally. That starts w/ knowing the truth of family immigration

https://t.co/msqWBotyTEA family-based immigration system IS a merit-based immigration system. 

In a new oped, @RepLindaSanchez &amp; I write about the history of why family is a part of our immigration laws, and why that's what already makes American great. https://t.co/msqWBotyTE@Perduesenate @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Use of slur "chain migration" intentionally distracts from the facts:

It's called family immigration 

It can take decades to reunite just 1 family member

There are no visas for aunts/uncles/cousins/grandparents
 
It's why immigrants use less gov't aid than native-born familiesThese white nationalist demands are far too high a price to pay in exchange for the White House to not do something it acknowledges would be cruel.The WH #immigration “compromise” is an insult to our nation. Changes to our Family-based immigration system are absolutely unacceptable. Contributing in America should not require abandoning your family. The proposal is a nativist dream meant to make America white again.Californians- you still have 6 days left to #GetCovered!

Fact: Immigrants commit FEWER crimes

Fact: Local police say acting as Federal immigration officers jeopardizes public safety

https://t.co/7DMniBRXH5I continue to see "chain migration" used by many even though that's not the legal term, just a slur coined to foment anti-immigrant sentiment. Could @APStylebook issue guidance on the proper term that should be used?  #APStyleChatWords like "illegal" are used to deny the humanity of immigrants, and make it easier to deport those around us who we literally depend on. I'm opposed to the cruel end of #TPS and war on immigrants. https://t.co/wSk53E2fPhI voted against the resolution to pause the #TrumpShutdown. Because, without any new agreement on disaster relief, long-term defense/domestic spending parity, or DACA, a pause is all it is. https://t.co/1rLFyZUmaJ45 years ago, #RoevWade recognized that women have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies. That freedom put an end to the horror of back-alley abortions, and has meant healthier families. But today it is under attack.
