Online attacks often evolve into physical violence, and modernizing our federal laws is vital to combat this crisis. Read about my online abuse bill here:  https://t.co/9LQbj0BcaoThis tragedy touches on so many crucial issues facing our country. We must to stop demonizing the press. We must reform our gun laws. And, we must address online abuse. https://t.co/TFVP3QqT3XAbsolutely heartbroken. I stand with those impacted (once again) by mass gun violence. Congress must stop sidestepping this American epidemic and act- NOW. #Annapolis  https://t.co/sjWhLxpZqn via @nbcnewsThe Family Case Management Program was 99% effective &amp; cost $36/day/family—but Trump cancelled and replaced it w/his zero tolerance policy. “Put simply, cruelty is not a side effect of the administration’s border policies; it is the policy, itself." https://t.co/5uI8xMla1yAngelica is in #MA. Her daughter was isolated from her in a #TX detention center. It's been *48 days* since they were ripped apart. I will not stop working until this family &amp; countless others are reunited &amp; the inhumanity stops. #FamiliesBelongTogether
https://t.co/q4DQbKmZf8Civic engagement is central to our democracy and I am so grateful to Misha and all my interns – past and present – for the invaluable contributions they've made to my office, #MA5, and our country. https://t.co/uYjiJiGyZbRepublicans once again brought a partisan immigration bill to the floor that replaced one form of child abuse for another, left #DREAMERS behind, &amp; drastically cut legal immigration. There is literally nothing that will motivate #GOP leadership to do the right thing.It’s hard to fathom that images of children in cages wouldn’t motivate people of good faith to fix our broken immigration system. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/GWojw4iLo2Here it is: The #GOPTaxScam has funded a record stock buyback and dividend spree benefiting CEOs and stockholders—NOT workers. We should be passing policies that grow our middle class instead of perpetuating income inequality.

https://t.co/QZJugeT6bJThe answer to fixing our immigration system isn't doing away with our Constitution. But this president has never been a fan of due process. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/6sIhIAhtK0The #GreenLineExtension will bring long-awaited environmental justice, public health benefits, and economic development to our community.

We must honor the best of our country’s ideals and demand family reunification.The reality is we are imprisoning families that are coming to us for refuge and instead of helping we are retraumatizing them. And now, Trump policy of tearing families apart has been replaced by plans for long term internment.Unfortunately, my visit to the border confirmed my worst fears. I met a
mother in detention whose son was sent to NY. No one could tell her where or how to contact him. I visited with children living on concrete floors huddled under mylar  blankets. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/CfDUFzkXT8Trump is presenting a false dichotomy: zero  tolerance vs. open borders. What we need is reform that honors our nation’s legacy of inclusivity and opportunity for all.Our immigration system is broken but this administration has put it up in flames. https://t.co/kKgyQwFGMbArrived at the Border Security Station in McAllen, Texas. We are here to ask question, get answers and demand reunification and respect for those arriving at our southern border.  #ireallydocare #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/gcBzya7ULTI really do care – and Americans care — about treating every person with dignity and respect. See you in Texas. https://t.co/HOnGRaKGrjI urge my Senate colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill, an important step forward in our fight against the #opioidepidemic. #EPCSActBy requiring every prescription written for a #Medicare Part D beneficiary to be prescribed electronically by 2021, the #EPCSAct will make it harder to forge prescriptions, easier to prevent doctor shopping, save the government money, and save lives.One of the many factors that contribute to the #opioidcrisis is the sheer volume of opioids in circulation – 214M prescriptions for opioids were issued in 2016, according to @CDCgov.I, along with @RepMullin, introduced the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely (EPCS) Act to better track and secure opioid prescriptions—and it just passed the House! 
https://t.co/ufYHa8JO5j3,289 girls are in the Unaccompanied Alien Children program. How many were separated from their parents at the border? More importantly, where are they? We need answers and I’m going to Texas today to hold this Administration accountable. #WhereAreTheGirls? https://t.co/ZiOzWDfKgGYesterday, the #GOP voted to place work requirements on 50-to-59-year-old #SNAP recipients, putting them at risk of food insecurity while failing to recognize the systemic issues that perpetuate poverty. Facts here:  https://t.co/Z2c2e91Vf0This is Jen. Protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions allowed her and her newborn daughter to get the care they needed. We must #ProtectOurCare from #GOP attacks for Jen, her family, and countless others. https://t.co/MLSFR4tGt8One of my many questions as I travel to the border this weekend: #WhereAreTheGirls? #FamiliasUnidasNoDivididas #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/7DmN76E03jTrump's EO provides no resolution or plans to reunite the 2,300 children torn from their parents. On Friday, I'm traveling to Texas to demand answers on how these families are being treated and when they will be reunited. #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/SlXfWvN1Ng@evatgrant @heycriticalmass @garbatiniaya @LRHSlaby @TheSamfund Thanks for stopping by and for your advocacy!ICYMI: I joined the Monday edition of @NECN’s #TheTake with Sue O’Connell to talk my bill to ease the addiction workforce shortage – and more.

This is dangerous and unacceptable.Wondering who the #GOP is fighting for? Yesterday, they released a budget that balances the massive tax breaks they gave to corporations &amp; billionaires on the backs of middle class families by making cuts to Medicare &amp; Social Security.
