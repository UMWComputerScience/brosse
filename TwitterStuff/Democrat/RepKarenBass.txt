To the hundreds of thousands taking to the streets today in protest of the Trump administration’s separation of families at the border —  WE ARE WITH YOU. Congress should pass our bill to reunify these IMMEDIATELY. #FamilesBelongTogetherI’m crushed by the scene yesterday in Maryland. This could happen anywhere, to anyone’s father, mother, brother, sister or child. 

This is an epidemic. We must #EndTheViolence.  

https://t.co/ub0qSnM9yEMore than 2,000 children may never see their families again if the government doesn’t take responsibility for reuniting them. I’ve introduced the Family Unity Rights and Protection Act to REQUIRE the government to reunify these families. #FURPA https://t.co/GUS7XE0GseI just introduced the Family Unity rights and Protection Act, which will FORCE the government to reunify the families ripped apart at the border. House Republicans blocked it when I called for a vote. 

The government separated the families. The government should be responsible. https://t.co/xjorjwYRC65 years ago yesterday, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. Since then, more than 24 states have enacted anti-voter laws in an attempt to unwind decades of civil rights progress. Every American must be guaranteed a voice in our democracy – we must #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/iECnsqY35tThe Trump administration is using separated children as collateral for funding his wall and forced deportations. I’ll be introducing legislation this week to require that the government reunite families that have been forcibly separated at the border. 
https://t.co/DX45q1lvJbHow can the Supreme Court say that Trump's #MuslimBan had nothing to do with religion when he himself said he wanted a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”?

That’s exactly what this is. And it’s absolutely abhorrent.Last week, Antwon Rose was shot 3 times in the back while unarmed. Today, he was laid to rest.  
 
4 years ago, Tamir Rice was shot while playing in a playground. Today would’ve been his 16th birthday.
 
Being young and black in America should not be a crime punishable by death.I’m introducing legislation to absolutely require the federal government to reunite the separated families and to make sure parental rights aren’t terminated going forward. 

What this administration has done is a tragedy and will be remembered in history. https://t.co/N5YdhChIfbRT: If you are receiving Temporary Protected Status (TPS) under Honduras’ designation and want to maintain your status through the effective termination date of Jan. 5, 2020, you must re-register between June 5, 2018, and Aug. 6, 2018. Re-register here: https://t.co/ueX3IaPSLRBe sure to know the latest regarding metro construction on Crenshaw Blvd! There will be a full closure of Crenshaw Blvd between 43rd and 48th until July 27th. https://t.co/w6Z6D8vd2VThere was perhaps no bigger leader in the movement for civil rights in Los Angeles than John. His fight inspired thousands and his victories transformed millions. 

May you rest, now, in peace. 

https://t.co/cMyBlhxe3C https://t.co/nJWqTs2v0cThe separation of families is state-sanctioned child abuse. Watch my interview about it with @Trevornoah on @TheDailyShow below. https://t.co/YwMIT69yOMI’ll be introducing legislation to force the federal government to take responsibility for the separation of families at our border and reunite these children with their parents. 

We are responsible for their separation, we must also be responsible for their reunification. https://t.co/v7uu4QbVCHThe opioid epidemic ravaging states and cities across the country has sent a record number of children into the foster care system. By keeping families together, we can ease the strain on this already overburdened system. #FosterYouthVoices  

https://t.co/KJm7mNXCujTrump TV aka @FoxNews is state-sponsored propaganda. They want you to believe these kids are in summer camp when the only camp this is close to is an internment camp. #KeepFamiliesTogetherThe two Republican immigration bills being voted on this week are the products of Trump using separated parents and children as collateral. 

Both fund the wall. 

Both fail #DREAMers.  

Neither stop the zero-tolerance policy. 

I’ll be voting no on both.Today on #WorldRefugeeDay, don’t forget that much of the violence that people are fleeing was created by US deportation policy. MS-13 started in LA and was exported to Central America. Now we’ve shut our doors to those seeking refuge. We have to do our part to help those in need.Babies and toddlers may never see their parents again because of your policy. Babies and toddlers. https://t.co/R6dai8sMNWTrump and his administration CREATED the state-sanctioned child abuse. Now he signs an executive order to stop what he started. 
https://t.co/wE6AHVBHdsMaybe we quit the United Nations Human Rights Council so that we couldn't get kicked out for state-sanctioned child abuse. #KeepFamiliesTogether 

https://t.co/rc2lS0oMekWhat @realDonaldTrump is doing to families at the border is a human rights abuse and should be illegal. Today I joined more than 100 members of Congress  in introducing legislation making it just that – a CRIME. #KeepFamiliesTogetherSecretary Kirstjen Nielsen must resign because of the human rights abuses our country has committed under her watch at our border. I’ve heard the cries of the children. It’s time to end the lies and deception. https://t.co/nrgrEM8CXYAs we violate human rights at our border, Trump has left the UN Human Rights Council. 

This is a shameful abdication of moral leadership. 

https://t.co/s54O2vrxiEToday on #Juneteenth we commemorate the end of centuries of slavery here in the United States, which was justified in part by the exact same bible passage that Jeff Sessions and the White House used last week to justify separation of immigrant families. We remember.Final touches before heading on with @Trevornoah to discuss Trump’s absolutely abhorrent policy to separate immigrant families. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/oSuJWhQ7s03 years ago yesterday, 9 people lost their lives in Charleston because of the color of their skin and a flimsy background check. We must do better in their honor. You are not forgotten. https://t.co/B6udz4gIbfRomans 13 was used to justify apartheid in South Africa and slavery in America.

https://t.co/Ht1mQeU4TQTrump is using separated children in detention centers as a negotiating tool to try to fund his border wall. This is HIS design, HIS plan, HIS policy. 

https://t.co/S12zZ5Y4TpThe American people will never “sit at attention” for you. 

Congress will never “sit at attention” for you.

I will never “sit at attention” for you. 

https://t.co/MCJnK4NN8LThis #FathersDay, I think about the separated children in detainment centers throughout the country wondering whether or not they’ll ever see their father again. 

I also think about the father in the White House responsible for their misery.

#FamiliesBelongTogetherI’ll be live tonight with @billmaher on @RealTimers to dissect the week. Be sure to tune in! https://t.co/Em9UQGjDSOIt is an absolute lie that the Trump administration has not encouraged the separation of immigrant families. 

https://t.co/Mg8vmK44t8Trump's characterization of a brutal dictatorship as "tough" is absolutely unacceptable and brings into question whether or not he was thoroughly prepared or briefed for his summit. https://t.co/LLVzcx7BBkJoining @CNN live to discuss the problems with calling the dictator of an oppressive regime “funny” and “smart”. Tune in! https://t.co/LYkdv9dAiIThere are thousands of stories like Hyun-ock Seo’s – Korean Americans who haven’t seen their family since the peninsula was divided. Last week I introduced a resolution encouraging reunions for these families. 60+ years is too long. 

https://t.co/Lbc7kRmpfXExcept for a threat to the child, separating a child from his or her parent is illegal in all 50 states, and for good reason. Read my piece on family separation in the @nytimes from last week below. 
https://t.co/RWTFoVxgxyThe Trump administration has spent the week asserting there’s a special place in hell for the leader of one of our closest allies, while developing a “special bond” with the dictator of one of the most repressive authoritarian states in the world.In 1953, the division of the Korean Peninsula separated more than an estimated 10 million families, including some whom are now US citizens &amp; have not seen their families in 68 years. Proud to introduce a resolution encouraging reunions of these divided families. #ReunifyFamilies https://t.co/1USHv5ijICIn May, we lost a true civil rights hero in Dovey Johnson Roundtree. Her courageous victories in courtrooms across the country, including the only explicit ruling against "separate but equal" laws, secured rights for African Americans across the US. Celebrate her name. #OurStory https://t.co/CcZpJ4SX4w267 days ago, I introduced a resolution calling for a limit on the President’s ability to pardon or grant a reprieve to him or herself. 

We should vote on it. 

Now.Tuesday was the birthday of John Carlos. Whether it’s a fist in the air or a knee on the ground, we will not stop our fight for justice. https://t.co/3ChUlLBc4yThis is criminal. 

It is not incumbent on just us as a country to draw attention to this immoral practice, it is incumbent on the international community and the entire world to RESPOND to this human rights abuse. 

6/6

https://t.co/H45BiFV7WqAnd after all of that pain of separation? Some parents never see their child again. When the parent is separated from their child, there’s no explanation given -- no way to contact them or find out where they were moved. 5/
https://t.co/aUT5sx5jIrFor these very reasons, more than 200 child welfare, juvenile justice and child development organizations signed a letter to the Trump administration demanding an end to migrant family separation. 4/ https://t.co/CFG0sXcg3RStudies have also found that toxic stress levels caused by family separation harms children, including damaging brain development and increasing the likelihood of chronic conditions like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and heart disease.  3/When parents and their kids are apprehended, they can be held in confinement for WEEKS. Experts have come out strongly against this practice, including the @AmerAcadPeds &amp; the @AmerMedicalAssn. Forcibly separating youth is a life-long sentence. 2/ 

https://t.co/RWTFoVfFG0The OUTRAGEOUS separation of families at the border isn’t just a temporary consequence that ends upon reunification of the child and their parent. Separation means significant trauma for both. 1/ 
https://t.co/o7v5zUD1xtThe Environmental Protection Agency's proposed "transparency rule" undermines the integrity of the agency's rule-making and research. Today, I joined 100+ of my colleagues in opposing this attempt to censor science.  

https://t.co/esmo8tU9eRThe Supreme Court’s ruling on Monday was a lost opportunity to reaffirm the civil rights of millions of people in this country. #PrideMonth is a time to continue our fight against homophobia and transphobia in the spirit of love and equality. #OpenToAll

https://t.co/ASmRJp5nOoConsolidating welfare programs will hurt our most vulnerable. Cutting foreign aid will make our international leadership impossible. 

This must not stand.

https://t.co/YjPmd6s7qeThe misuse of the our child welfare system to punish immigrant parents is an egregious violation of human rights. Some of these parents may never find their children again -- what does that say to the world about the United States? https://t.co/TGyQJENASyToday is the first day to register for the Congressional App Challenge! Learn more here: https://t.co/2bD7tCZhl5 @CongressionalACThe purpose of our child welfare system is to protect children from abuse or neglect. Never in history has this system been used to punish parents. #KeepFamiliesTogether

https://t.co/HVTZkUNtx1This #MemorialDay, we honor and give humble thanks to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We will never forget what you have done, nor what your families have endured. Thank you for your service.Wielding the child welfare system as a deterrent or a punishment for anyone, whether they are Americans or not, is inhumane. It’s impractical, barbaric, and YOUR POLICY. https://t.co/rHRu7SepMXBlue Star Families, the Department of Defense, and more than 2,000 museums are providing free museum admission to active duty military personnel this summer - from Memorial Day to Labor Day.

Congress should pass the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, which I support along with more than 100 of my colleagues. We cannot wait until it’s too late.I hope that Americans everywhere continue to engage in their first amendment right and in November, I hope they use their right to vote. 

https://t.co/LY0YSisRfHThere was no plan. There is no plan.
https://t.co/aJzZfsyKJmNo one knows the child welfare system like current and former foster youth. Today, I was joined by Megan, who flew across the country for the first time to share her experience in the child welfare system with me. 

Thank you for your bravery.

#FosterYouthVoices https://t.co/pQ1Rj7Xm9xWho better to change the child welfare system than those who grew up in it? So proud to bring more than 100 current and former foster youth to DC this week to speak with THEIR representative about how together, they can change this system for the better. #FosterYouthVoices https://t.co/PCOHs08vxwCongratulations to Prince Harry and former California 37th District resident Meghan Markle! I hope Meghan’s bold activism and Harry’s rebukes of racist attacks against her foreshadow a bright future for the couple. I wish you both (and mom!) all the best! #RoyalWedding2018 https://t.co/12vPU1bPN4I shouldn’t have to be “proud” when Congress comes together to block legislation that would’ve taken food out of the mouths of 2 million people. 

https://t.co/1W9K3ruHmCSo sad and so angry as I watch the footage from Texas. 

1,981 days ago, this was the scene in Sandy Hook. 
93 days ago, this was the scene in Parkland. 
EVERYDAY, this is a headline in so many neighborhoods.

INACTION is the greatest enabler of this cycle.

We are NOT helpless.RIGHT NOW: Republicans are putting forward Paul Ryan’s farm bill to drastically cut funding from food assistance programs dedicated to helping our country’s most vulnerable families. 

Food is not a luxury. Being hungry is not a choice. I’ll be voting NO on this terrible bill. https://t.co/ygyGQD1JccIt was a pleasure to see La Reyna y La Real here in DC. Hasta la próxima vez en Cuba! https://t.co/MSTmBRUZGO64 years ago today, the Supreme Court ruled school segregation was unconstitutional in #BrownvBoard. This was a beginning -- by no means an end. There’s still so much to fight for… and against. 

https://t.co/tIjmP5RyovDehumanization in rhetoric is the first step to dehumanization in policy. This remark is a perplexingly racist mischaracterization of undocumented immigrants aimed to set the stage for the Trump immigration agenda. https://t.co/xIhrfr39BcRamadan Mubarak to each of those celebrating the beginning of this holy month across our country and throughout the entire world!We must fight on. Thank you @repjohnlewis for your words at @CoCoSouthLA.

For those celebrating today, happy mothers day! Without your sacrifices, we’d be nothing.One of the worst things we can do to our child welfare system is overload it and one of the worst things we can do to an addicted parent is rip their kids away from them. Thank you @DrPhil &amp; @Robin_McGraw for the solutions you testified about yesterday. #FosterYouthVoices https://t.co/SfRZ6p58lxTrump’s continuing obsession with destroying President Obama’s legacy first risked the health insurance of millions.

There is too much at stake. #FollowTheFacts https://t.co/fxpYnIPpZBUsing our child welfare system as a way to deter immigration is an egregious abuse of not only the child welfare system, but the children in it. The system is for children who have been abused or neglected, not to prevent someone from crossing our border. https://t.co/TqCJa14iEEMay is #NationalFosterCareMonth!

They should not need to march for their lives for Congress to act. https://t.co/jdiEC074XKSubjecting pregnant women to languish in detention centers that historically fail to meet the health needs of pregnant women is nothing short of cruel and unusual.

https://t.co/8F0LhmvqcoThank you Naomi Wadler for raising the voices of the Black and Brown women and girls whose deaths don’t make the headlines. #MarchForOurLives 

https://t.co/Uz3XciXFzbThey used to say slavery was a “local matter”. 

They used to say Jim Crow segregation was a “local matter”. 

https://t.co/ZaZR5RJTyzEvidence and testimony at last week’s @OfficialCBC hearing on Black Identity Extremism raised further questions about the origins of this term. Looking forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue. https://t.co/LRB8SvNkUyTrump is choosing intimidation over accuracy. The citizenship question on the 
#2020Census is a systematic attempt to intimidate people in blue states from filling it out. A low count would lead to a loss of seats in state legislatures and Congress. https://t.co/hnpoy3WdLVAlton Sterling was shot 3 times with one cop kneeling on his chest and the other on his thigh after they had tased him several times. No federal charges, no state charges, no justice for Black men in America.

https://t.co/StpQ724yWwWhen @CoCoSouthLA was founded, the intention was to always be of the youth, for the youth, by the youth. So proud of Edna and the power of South LA being represented on the national stage. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/wO56S99lTqTonight's massacre of equal rights in our military must not go unnoticed. To the brave trans folks who continue to put your lives on the line for our liberty -- this country is most thankful for your service.

https://t.co/XkM4f16FEYThe youth will lead us. #NeverAgain https://t.co/ppTgxRbQtVMore than 2,262 people have already been killed by someone using a gun in 2018. This is a PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE and Congress should address it as such. #NeverAgainAnother demonstration that Africa is a continent of economic opportunity and not a s***hole. @realDonaldTrump 

https://t.co/6L0jRqSOI4The Trump Administration has tapped a long time anti-transgender advocate to negotiate the Agreed Conclusions document from the Commission on the Status of Women. The @USUN must preserve the commitment of equal rights for women, girls and LGBT people. 

https://t.co/VLGEK5c5bXWe introduced the Dream Act 240 days ago. #DreamActNow https://t.co/XBQxJUNICjThe white man who set off 6 bombs in Texas was closely watched and then tailed by police until he went off the road.

The Black man with an iPhone was shot 20 times in his grandmother’s backyard.

https://t.co/QmfIbRVDE8John Bolton is being rewarded for selling the lie of WMDs in Iraq and peddling hatred of Muslims with the position of national security advisor. Trump continues to put our country at imminent risk of unnecessary war by hosting this hatred. https://t.co/cVINNMUeMHI wonder if Trump will call Putin to congratulate him on the fact that the House Intelligence Committee just closed their investigation into Russian Collusion. 
https://t.co/OM3AYCJXHwNo one working on the ground wants this. Republicans proposed this in the 80s – it’s been tried and it has failed. Egregious sentencing will NOT alleviate any root causes of this epidemic.

This would be a purge of State Department diplomats on behalf of one man at the extreme expense of our country's ability give aid, secure peace, and LEAD. https://t.co/dVMaTF2LjQHUD spent $31k on a dining room set for Ben Carson’s office.
The EPA spent $43k to install a private phone booth in Scott Pruitt's office.
The Dept of the Interior spent $139k on doors in Ryan Zinke’s office.

Remember when @SpeakerRyan was excited about $1.50 in your paycheck?The only thing that could send a clearer message that this investigation is serious would be the Trump Organization refusing the subpoena or Trump firing Mueller.

What do my colleagues think these young people are going to do when they turn 18? VOTE.Today, Congress marks 1 month since Parkland, 129 days since Sutherland Springs, 164 days since Las Vegas, 640 days since Orlando, and 833 days since San Bernardino with 0 meaningful action to prevent gun violence.Yesterday, Sec. Tillerson accused Russia of poisoning of an ex-spy in the U.K. Either he said that because he already knew he was being fired or he said that and got fired after. Yet another example of Trump protecting the interests of Russia over our country. #FollowtheFactsNeed help with public safety, employment or immigration? Join me this Saturday for my #FamilyMatters community resource fair. https://t.co/fQfaL8KFhCIf Jared Kushner was not Trump’s son-in-law, he would not be able to get a job in any branch of government. 

https://t.co/myEJ5LT5a5Providing "rigorous" firearms training to teachers puts millions of dollars in the NRA’s pocket and makes Los Angeles schools less safe. This does not say #NeverAgainThe Country: “How can we take guns out of schools?” 

Trump: “Add more guns and not make it any harder for people to get guns.”

https://t.co/oL2juwBgVdTrump’s number one priority should be protecting this country. His actions show that he will not do that, which just makes you wonder – why? https://t.co/tAQxzp12e7The problem with Trump’s North Korea meeting is the spontaneity of his acceptance. After no consultation (not that he has appointed an ambassador to South Korea to consult with), Trump is ready to meet with North Korea’s dictator.

Protecting this country shouldn’t be an option. Today I joined @RepDennyHeck and @RepLanceNJ7 in introducing the DISARM Act to force sanctions on Russia. 

Congress should pass it immediately.Proud to recognize the powerful women all around the world who lead movements and move mountains.

https://t.co/CCTVatxrGEThankfully, our courts have ruled that today’s arbitrary deadline cannot be enforced, but this does not mean this issue is no longer urgent. Congress could pass the #DREAMAct THIS WEEK. 

Cc: @SpeakerRyan  

https://t.co/vJaT2AQ5nJThere was never a need to “fix” DACA. Instead, Trump decided to throw red meat to his base and impose an artificial deadline, putting 800,000 lives in limbo.Calling all high school artists!

https://t.co/t1RLNJs9G2Two federal courts have ruled the Trump administration's action to end DACA was illegal and today, the Supreme Court moved to leave DACA in place. While this is a relief, we MUST continue to fight for a clean #DREAMAct to make sure our #DREAMers are here to stay.Thank you to the more than 150 constituents that showed up to my community meeting last week in Baldwin Hills and Ladera Heights, I look forward to continuing to work on the important issues raised. https://t.co/XKue7V7LlbTune in to @ABC7 this morning at 11 AM PT for an exclusive interview with @ABC7Adrienne about how Congress should respond to gun violence in our country. #NeverAgain https://t.co/OWtwezYioMAnd Trump is their pitchman. The companies that sell the weapons get richer. More people will die.The NRA is attempting pull off one of their greatest heists yet by selling weapons to schools.

https://t.co/XmAdvzQDQ0As the nation watches the #ParklandTownHall tonight, I hope lawmakers find the same courage that these survivors have to tell their stories. No amount of moments of silence will ease this suffering, only action can. Only action WILL.FACT: There is a law called the Dickey Amendment that specifically PREVENTS the CDC from researching ways to prevent these mass shootings.FACT: Trump’s 2019 Budget cuts $665 million from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration.FACT: Just one year ago, Trump and Republicans repealed a rule to keep firearms OUT of the hands of some people deemed mentally ill.Right now, someone can get kicked out of a bar because they are too young to drink and then go buy a semi-automatic assault rifle made for war. Where is the courage of lawmakers in this country? Why have we been doing more to arm people than protect them?The way to keep guns OUT of our schools is not to put guns in them. Trump’s suggestion today is absolutely unfathomable and must be stopped.Thanks to all of those that came out on Saturday for a meeting with myself and LA Council President @HerbJWesson regarding issues affecting Baldwin Vista! https://t.co/n6ylpfjgAjThe problem of youth being locked up because they have no parents to retrieve them &amp; no placement in the foster care system underscores the serious consequences often facing children arrested at state-licensed facilities.

No one can deny Russia's involvement now.It’s been 17 days since Trump decided to NOT sanction Russia. Since then, he’s released the #NunesMemo, stopped the release of the correcting memo, and continued to call Russia’s SUCCESSFUL operation to interfere with our elections a hoax.Arresting 212 working people at more than 100 local Los Angeles businesses will rip apart families and damage of local economy. 
https://t.co/frwqvXgJ4WThis has never been a hoax. This has never been a witch hunt. We have mere months before our next election and still have done NOTHING to prevent attacks like these from happening again.
https://t.co/7HiZKNPseyThere were more kids shot to death at a high school in #Parkland today than meaningful actions taken by Congress to stop mass shootings. 

Think and pray on that.Soul wrenching. #Parkland is no different from LA. This could happen anywhere, in any school, to anyone’s kids. Our hearts are with Parkland, our hearts are with Las Vegas, our hearts are with Sutherland Springs, Orlando, San Bernardino &amp; Sandy Hook. When will we stop asking why?ICE's threats following the 98 7-Eleven raids last month are startling when contextualized by the fact that only 21 people were arrested. Either ICE was given erroneous evidence that was then misjudged and acted upon, or there was no evidence to begin with. We want answers. https://t.co/FV84HuKFHcLetters &amp; calls to my offices concerned about Russian interference: 46,345

What happened to transparency and #releasethememo?

https://t.co/CDohcB4FnnToday the @NAACP celebrates 109 years of activism on behalf of people throughout this country. Here’s to 109 more. #BlackHistoryMonthWhen you hope that a man who did THIS to his wife “has a great career ahead of him,” you show the world you are complicit.

At 5 AM, yet again, I voted NO. I stand with our more than 700,000 #DREAMers throughout the country from Africa, Asia &amp; Latin America.INCREDIBLE. Republicans have shut the government down for the second time in less than one month despite being in charge of the entire federal government.Like @FullFrontalSamB said last night -- surveilling or arresting Americans because of their race is wrong. The FBI's made-up term #BlackIdentityExtremist is already being used to target young Black activists. https://t.co/JvAN079wbQTrump remains the only person to advocate for a shutdown. This as his Chief of Staff offends 800k people that he hopes to deport by calling them lazy. It’s hard to believe Republicans say it’s Democrats that cause shutdowns and not their leader, who is rooting openly for one.Tonight my thoughts are with @donlemon and his family as they undergo the immense pain of the devastating loss of a loved one. Tonight's tribute was truly beautiful, know we are here for you with love.Thank you to the @BedrosianCenter for hosting a forum last week on the FBI’s Black Identity Extremist report and raising awareness around the unconstitutional targeting of young black activists. https://t.co/1XdSiAcm3wTrump tweeting about vindication in the third person exemplifies what the #NunesMemo is all about.

https://t.co/Eogkbruc6KAs Trump prepares to deliver the #SOTU tonight, we remember a year of immigration policy that has put nearly 800,000 people in limbo, wondering whether or not they will be deported next month. Read my op-ed below. #AYearofTrump https://t.co/0u6688uhIMIf I don't go to the State of the Union tomorrow, it wouldn't be an act of protest --- it would be about whether or not I wanted to subject myself to listen to Trump's lies and insults. https://t.co/7IIIdTa5H8Congress voted for sanctions on Russia. If Trump does not comply with today’s deadline, it will send a clear message that he stands with Russia over the will of the American people.  
https://t.co/HPh9Dol36vToday on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the world remembers the atrocities of Hitler and the Nazi regime.

No test should be able to discern whether or not you get care or don't. https://t.co/U5bWtJrdweTrump’s new immigration plan is unacceptable. When we see that tens of thousands of DACA enrollees are black &amp; that the plurality of diversity visa recipients are also black, it contextualizes the assault on these programs &amp; reminds us that we can't turn on each other in response https://t.co/Bn5n7c01fiImagine the growth and opportunity we could benefit from through increased partnership with Africa if we didn’t have a president that referred to countries there as "shitholes."Firing the investigator that is investigating you is nearly the definition of obstructing justice. Congress should do everything it can to protect this investigation until its completion. https://t.co/r25SJQkD06Last week, Congress passed legislation including by bill that will expand the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act.

The work will never stop, no matter how hard Trump tries to keep us shut down.DAY 3: This morning, thousands of federal workers will not come to work because of Republican’s inability to sit down and look at bipartisan solutions to funding the gov't. Too bad they spent all of their time on tax cuts for corporations &amp; not on funding insurance for 9 mil kids.@realDonaldTrump is not only the first president to shut the government down while having power in the House and Senate, but also now the record holder for earliest shutdown in a presidency. #TrumpShutdownCommunity health centers across the country will have to cut back services. If funding is not reauthorized, more than SIX locations that provide care for low-income families in our district will close. This shutdown will cost BILLIONS. Unacceptable.Day 2 of not paying normal duty military personnel, not paying military death benefits, not paying tens of thousands of federal employees, and the closing some life-saving community health centers . Republicans hold the keys.Degrading the readiness of our military and preventing every government agency from properly serving the American people is not a way to govern. The government will open as soon as Republicans present a reasonable plan. https://t.co/wE5JvReug7It is SICK Republicans have sat on CHIP funding to make it seem like somehow this shutdown could possibly be on anyone but them. Control of the White House, Senate &amp; House of Reps? In 2020 we'll show you what a government is supposed to look like.Funding insurance for the Children's Health Insurance Program is just half the battle -- Most of the 9 million kids that need that get help from community health centers &amp; hospitals which will LOSE FUNDING. At least 6 centers will be forced to close in my district among many moreTrump referred to Haiti and countries from Africa as shitholes. Congress should show Trump and the WORLD that America does not feel that way. We should #CensureTrump immediately. If my Republican colleagues TRULY think those comments were reprehensible, now is the time to show it https://t.co/NXDAz80mU1Today, @NASA ranked 2017 as the second-warmest year, after 2016. Yesterday's unprecedented mass-resignation was the result of Trump ignoring science and undermining environmental protections. Climate change is REAL and happening NOW. https://t.co/fmwE81z7KiRepublicans are in charge of EVERY branch of government. If they wanted to restore DACA they would have and if they wanted to save insurance for 9 million kids they would have. Instead they want a political fight and a useless wall.Last night on @CNNTonight, @donlemon told me Trump said his approval among Black Americans doubled. 

Doubled from what, one to two? https://t.co/G0aBBRtiuRHere's the truth to the FALSE narrative perpetuated by Trump -- African immigrants are more educated than most, including people born in U.S. https://t.co/yVmgrbGFrnI’ve introduced legislation which would call to limit Trump’s ability to pardon his grown children (Kushner included) no matter what happens. #NoTrumpPardon

The African continent could not be further from Trump’s description. 

We will continue to fight here in Congress to pass the #AmericanPromiseAct and work to protect the Diversity Visa Program. Don’t lose hope.The African Union even put out a statement today expressing disappointment and outrage over his comments. https://t.co/M6WZhfqi4vTrump’s comments have real, international consequences too -- take the front page of the @TheStarKenya ahead of a trip I made with @BarackObama to Kenya in 2015, and compare that with a cartoon they ran today. Our perception internationally is deteriorating. https://t.co/nbh6u5ltwHHere’s a picture of then 2nd Lt.

According to Trump, he is from a "shithole". https://t.co/VPeY6c3wSrCapt. Ademola Fabayo, born in Nigeria, was awarded the Navy Cross for his bravery in Afghanistan. https://t.co/osQ54dHzSLThere are Americans from the countries that Trump referred to yesterday that have more courage and dignity than he will ever have. By insulting them, he makes us weaker.Today marks #NationalHumanTraffickingAwarenessDay. 60% of child sex trafficking victims in the US have histories in the child welfare system. The Caucus on Foster Youth is committed to continuing our work to fight human trafficking in all forms &amp; supporting #FosterYouthVoices.@realDonaldTrump We will, and we must, continue to fight against this barrage of perpetually racist remarks and fight FOR those immigrants that call our country home -- those who are a part of our communities and our economy. WE WILL NOT STOP FIGHTING FOR YOU. https://t.co/do7QwnLiqP@realDonaldTrump Your language plunges our country back into the deep depths of history when espousing racism behind the closed oval office doors was not only permitted, but expected &amp; encouraged. You diminish the presidency and embarrass us to the world. Your idol Andrew Jackson would be proud..@realDonaldTrump -- You would never call a predominantly white country a “shithole” because you are unable to see people of color, American or otherwise, as equals.People don’t CHOOSE to be poor just like that people don’t CHOOSE to be unemployed just because they have Medicaid. Creating costs to take services away from low-income people weakens us as a country.
https://t.co/ap4sjJJCwoFirst the tax plan, now offshore drilling – Trump has continued his crusade against political opponents by removing Florida from possible offshore drilling expansion and keeping CA. 
https://t.co/A6IdZpIy96100 years ago today, the House of Representatives led by the first Congresswoman, Jeanette Rankin of Montana, voted to give women the right to vote. I’m proud to work with the strong women of the @DWWG to protect and expand our progress. https://t.co/j6nR6sgnF4Yesterday’s meeting demonstrated Trump doesn’t even know what he himself thinks about DREAMers. What IS clear, is that more than 700,000 lives hang in the balance as he and Republicans play politics. We can pass the #DreamAct RIGHT NOW if we wanted to. 

https://t.co/ew5f5wzn2tDon’t forget -- immigration is a Black issue.
https://t.co/WG5LsqEyLXThe deportation of 200,000 Salvadorans will tear apart families and disrupt local communities across the country. Congress needs to pass the American Promise Act, a bill I introduced with @NydiaVelazquez to provide TPS recipients with a path to naturalization and to #SaveTPS. https://t.co/0QIO9GEr3yOn September 24, 2016, the @NMAAHC opened on the National Mall. 16 years after President George W. Bush secured funding, President Barack Obama saw it through. Compare this picture to what we see in politics today. This embrace is what makes America, America. https://t.co/zuvpnsN5ZlWe actually have Members of Congress that are trying to end an investigation that is looking at an attack on our election system. I don't think there's any historical precedent for what we see going on right now. https://t.co/ChpYZkSeQURepublicans are doing everything they can to lay the foundation to discredit Mueller. Remember how serious these investigations are -- our elections were ATTACKED. You'd think politicians would be flocking to find out what happened regardless of party. https://t.co/Ub9EmlwbbMDiscussing the DoJ's latest investigations, which are a response to Trump's instability, live on @MSNBC NOW. Tune in!January is National Mentoring Month. To all of the mentors nationwide -- thank you for changing lives and protecting #FosterYouthVoices https://t.co/Wb7tVPuT7rProtecting the environment from excessive offshore drilling is a bipartisan issue. This not only puts local economies at risk, but excels CLIMATE CHANGE -- a concept Trump has demonstrated that he fundamentally does not grasp. 
https://t.co/JbvFMJLLOVThis is another example of the Trump administration punishing Dem-heavy states just like they did in their tax plan. 
https://t.co/o02cAUY7GZThis commission was always a thinly veiled attempt to embolden voter suppression efforts. Now that its mission has been integrated into the Department of Homeland Security, we can't let up -- we must be as vigilant as ever to defend the integrity of our upcoming elections. https://t.co/cIT9799NhbThe #NoTrumpPardon Resolution would tell Trump it’s unacceptable to pardon his son or son-in-law. RT if you agree that Congress should pass it NOW. 
https://t.co/nBzpOdRfabThe juvenile &amp; irresponsible behavior of comparing nuclear button sizes with the leader of North Korea further diminishes our role in the int'l community and is the reason why I cosponsored legislation with Rep. @tedlieu that will prevent a presidential preemptive nuclear strike.The RESULT of your policy is that more than 8,000 people have lost their DACA protections and thousands more fear deportation. That’s because of YOU -- people of color are NOT going to fall in love with you. https://t.co/SZjYX24qu4Sexual harassment has to be combatted in Hollywood, DC and everywhere in between. #TIMESUP https://t.co/rpo1rywvU2From my family to yours -- Merry Christmas!This could be a precursor to using kids as a deterrent for immigration -- snatching them from their family and putting them in our foster care system, which is already overburdened due to opioids and poverty. John Kelly said so himself in March. https://t.co/O4q8vs5ZyGUsing policy to detain parents separately from their children is a torturous psychological trick that is below the dignity of our country. https://t.co/xfTdm6krxwJust voted NO on the "Tax Cuts For The Wealthy" Act AGAIN. Mark my words, first thing next year, Republicans will come worried about the deficit and target Social Security, Medicare, welfare and more. Keep your voices LOUD. https://t.co/oUtdZJ4H8UThanks @RepSteveChabot for visiting me in LA to tour programs aimed at reducing recidivism and crime like @HomeboyInd and @ANewWayofLife1. https://t.co/hWsJTlF1hTSTILL costs over 1 trillion dollars, STILL embraces trickledown economics, STILL fails the middle class. South LA has been waiting for trickledown for 30 years, we are NOT going to wait 30 more. https://t.co/DGZy9whFah2017 was a long year, but we can’t overlook the progress that we’ve made and the gains that the resistance has made as well. You can read a full run down of what my office has accomplished this year, here:  https://t.co/OFPo81iCPF https://t.co/AJxOkJ19dWDiversity Visa Program recipients are vetted by the State Department -- not picked from a “bin”  and certainly they're not “the worst of the worst". We must focus on real comprehensive immigration reform. https://t.co/OZQun6ly5kHey @AjitPaiFCC: I wanted to make sure you saw how my constituents feel about your vote today…
Calls to protect #NetNeutrality: 356
Calls to destroy #NetNeutrality: 05 years ago today, 20 innocent children and 6 brave educators lost their lives at #SandyHook Elementary. My thoughts are with the families of all of those lost to gun violence as we continue to make our communities safer. We will remember this day forever.They say the Black vote turn out was high despite Obama not being on the ballot but he WAS on the ballot. The lives of four black girls WERE on the ballot. Dr. King WAS on the ballot. The result? A new senator to begin a new chapter of history in Alabama. @RepValDemings knows!!The term "Black Identity Extremism" must be challenged. It sends a message that it's open season on black activists. https://t.co/xGLhMueZpcHere's an idea -- don't buy a house from a guy who thinks South LA needs to be "cleaned out". Gentrification does not need to be inevitable. We need to continue to make an effort to make affordable housing available to those that need it.

https://t.co/ZZrq2bExXQThe #AlabamaSenateElection was sweet justice, that's the only way to describe it. Thank you to the thousands of Black women that brought it home!! https://t.co/EjYBDvKERGIn moments I'll be live with @AriMelber on @MSNBC to discuss the HUGE win last night in Alabama. Tune in! https://t.co/ax8gpDUa3uWe need to know who authorized the FBI’s report on Black Identity Extremism but we also need to know how that term was even invented and accepted in the first place. With that mindset, we can start unraveling the systemic intentions this country has for young Black activists. https://t.co/9awdhwuXrSHow will House Republicans pay for their trillion dollar tax overhaul? Cuts to health care, food stamps, housing and veterans programs under the guise of “welfare reform”.

https://t.co/AlNCS8JgKKWhat’s better – rewriting the tax code in a meaningful and responsible way or a political win? Republicans say the latter. 
https://t.co/i7y7exMDdiMany states close enrollment this Friday. CALIFORNIANS: Don’t forget to apply for or change your health insurance plan by January 31st at https://t.co/5OWqmuZLuD https://t.co/qkBPR0dH8rAnd after last night, the nation saw. We are VOTING. https://t.co/mTP5l8uAfqWe are WATCHING https://t.co/ovr2psWm4zWe are POWERFUL https://t.co/8xKbEcLbnuWe are STRONG. https://t.co/KwwSz1Ff0THere's what should be a DAILY reminder that Black women are STRONG. Black women are POWERFUL. Black women are WATCHING. Black women are VOTING.More than 2 million kids are being used as political pawns. We’re better than this. Congress should reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program NOW. https://t.co/lsko4OX4l4This was a referendum on morality and @realDonaldTrump lost. Get ready for 2018. https://t.co/VWJWg893WO2 years ago, 195 nations came together to sign an agreement to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Since then, every country in the entire world has signed on while only one country left. This isn’t putting America first, it’s putting America last. #StillIn https://t.co/z0TB06jCeyTo those celebrating the first night of the Festival of Lights -  Happy Hanukkah! May these next eight nights bring you and your family joy and warmth. Chag Sameach! https://t.co/QM7RrvesmEHappy birthday @JoyAnnReid! Here's to many more years of quality journalism! https://t.co/y0FRkIypZMIt's ironic that the day after stumping for a Senate candidate that said a time when America was great was during the period of slavery, Trump appeared at the grand opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. It's an affront and an insult. https://t.co/uPnEPNRrVFI'll be live on @MSNBC in the next few minutes to respond to Trump's insulting appearance in Mississippi today. Tune in!Got to participate in a community forum on commercial exploitation of children and youth in Inglewood this afternoon. The more we know, the more we can fight this.UN peacekeepers and government troops risk their lives to protect civilians and facilitate access to humanitarian organizations. Those responsible must be held accountable and brought to justice. https://t.co/J8H4d6C9LOCc: @SpeakerRyan. Thoughts on the below from the man you appointed to be CHAIRMAN of the Subcommittee on the Constitution &amp; Civil Justice? What does your tolerance and protection show your children? https://t.co/dhBCs2TCPEA ray of justice: a white police officer will be sentenced to 19+ years for shooting an unarmed black man.
https://t.co/H95S6FoUdQInstead of staying away from this anticipated ceremony that people have died to ensure, Trump is arriving to declare victory – a victory to say that despite the movement being enshrined this weekend, dog whistle racism will prevail. It cannot. It must not. It will not. https://t.co/FcDXAau8uaToday, the @OfficialCBC met with the Amb. of Libya out of the profound concern that in this day and age, people are being sold as property in the #LibyaSlaveTrade. The int'l community must operate on the assumption that we don’t need further proof; what we need to do is stop it. https://t.co/P2vmqz498CThank you to the hundreds of graduate students at @UCLA and @USC that have reached out to my office about the #GOPTaxScam. We MUST protect future scholars, not increase their taxes. We’ll continue to fight in conference. Keep your voices LOUD. https://t.co/ds3iw7a4dsToday, I asked the FBI Director to retract his department's report on the FICTIONAL designation of Black Identity Extremism. 

I will not sit idly by as the FBI uses this report to target young black activists exercising their first amendment right AS THEY SHOULD. https://t.co/W3lqmExFEeThis morning, I’ll be following up on my questioning of AG Sessions with the FBI Director – the “black identity extremist” report is must be revoked. https://t.co/EmuDvkJwvTBlack immigrant stories can’t be left out of the immigration debate. We need a clean #DREAMAct NOW and we need to protect those with TPS. Thank you for your activism! https://t.co/Ch3z2oXFckThankful for the brave first responders combatting these terrible fires. My thoughts are with those evacuating in LA and Ventura.
