Today marks the 49th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. Let's honor the legacy of all the LGBTQ activists who risked their lives to move our country forward by forcefully condemning hate in all its forms &amp; carrying on the fight for full equality. #EqualityFoward"He’s the kind of person we want in this country." ICE should not be using its limited resources to go after a hardworking, law-abiding family man. Mr. Vokshi is a valued member of our community and my office is working w/ his legal team to bring him home. https://t.co/U3VC3xSIhHThank you for your work on this important issue! On this #PTSDAwarenessDay let's recommit to supporting our veterans &amp; all survivors of violent crime. https://t.co/ZnRN4C9UbNDevastated by the #Janus decision. This hands a victory to corporate interests &amp; will hurt working families. American workers are stronger when they unite to improve their wages, benefits, &amp; working conditions.Another bad SCOTUS decision: #NIFLAvBecerra allows crisis pregnancy centers to give women biased &amp; inaccurate information about their health. I'm cosponsoring the Stop Deceptive Advertising for Women's Healthcare Services Act to end this dangerous &amp; intentional deception.A bad decision by #SCOTUS does not change the fact that the travel ban is completely discriminatory &amp; does not make us any safer. All it does is legalize the president's openly xenophobic campaign promises. Shameful..@Newsday put it best: "It’s hard to imagine anyone fighting to return to a system that left many people with pre-existing conditions unable to buy health insurance..." 

How can the administration possibly defend this? #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/AW7NTrLE6YAfter spending the day w/officials from @CBP &amp; @HHSGov, &amp; seeing the temporary shelters in #Tornillo, one thing is clear: we cannot wait until November to act on immigration. Congress can &amp; should pass a bipartisan solution now. Anyone who's been here understands the urgency.Just wrapped up my visit to the #Tornillo facility with a bipartisan delegation. Securing our borders is critical, but we can't do so at the expense of our values. We are not a country that separates families, detains kids in tents or turns our back on those seeking asylum. https://t.co/QNz7u69EOjJust finished a briefing with @CBP on border operations. Arriving now at the facility in #Tornillo, Texas where migrant children are being held.2,300 kids were torn away from their families by our government. And there is still no plan for reuniting them. We shouldn’t be talking about anything else.The Executive Order does nothing to address reunification. We need to continue holding this administration accountable and we need to know exactly how &amp; when they plan to reunite the families that have already been separated.This week has shown the world frightening new levels of incompetence and
malevolence within the White House.On #WorldRefugeesDay we are reminded of our moral obligation to help the world's most vulnerable people. Our nation is a beacon of hope for those fleeing violence &amp; persecution, and we cannot turn our back on them. Today we reaffirm our commitment to refugees everywhere.I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the Keep Families Together Act. If you oppose the cruel practice of separating children from their parents then urge your representatives to support this bill too. #KeepFamiliesTogetherJeff Sessions &amp; John Kelly spoke publicly of using family separation as a deterrent. Then 2,000 kids were separated from their parents. Now @SecNielsen is denying that this was a policy &amp; is absolving the admin of any responsibility. She's misleading the public &amp; should resign.While you and your colleagues have been busy getting your half-baked story straight, there are 2,000 kids at the border who have in fact been separated from their families. Go see for yourself. Or better yet, just reunite them with their parents. This has to end. https://t.co/ZiUuo1gVmmThank you @RepPeteAguilar for Skyping into our #DACA forum today! It was great to have you with us in #NY04 as we talked about the next steps in our fight to #ProtectDreamers and why we’re completely opposed to the Republicans’ so-called “compromise” bill. https://t.co/TzRacQVIKuHad a great morning in #NY04 honoring our Vietnam vets and their families. Thank you to all those who joined us, especially the Brass Bois Quintet from #Freeport High School. Such a talented group! https://t.co/wlcZhNsOCnAn incredible honor to join so many Long Island veterans this morning as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War. We are eternally grateful for your service and sacrifice. https://t.co/SVqKUCtmUeTOMORROW: Please join us Saturday at 12:00pm for a DACA Forum. @RepPeteAguilar will be joining us via Skype for the first half hour to talk about pending legislation &amp; our strategy moving forward. https://t.co/58eZCCvBFzMañana: Acompáñanos en el foro sobre el Programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA).

El congresista @RepPeteAguilar, miembro del Caucus Hispano del Congreso, nos acompañará vía Skype de 12:00 a 12:30pm. https://t.co/QmutdBgQt1There's no law compelling Trump Admin to separate children from their parents at the border. They're purposely using this disgraceful policy as a deterrent for immigrant families fleeing violence &amp; it is immoral.Proud to have cosponsored the Synthetics Trafficking &amp; Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act, which would stop deadly synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, from entering the U.S. through international mail. Passing this bill was a critical step forward in fighting the #OpioidCrisisPlease join us for a Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War this Saturday, June 16th at 10:00am. https://t.co/rwSotFCi1HHad the most inspiring meeting with @SAAdvocacy. Ayisat shared her story about living with Dyslexia &amp; how her mom Caroline has been instrumental in helping her reach her full potential. Ayisat now works at the VA &amp; takes calls on the suicide prevention hotline. #InclusionEconomy https://t.co/U0xafPBKurIt's been two years since #Pulse &amp; not enough progress has been made. This #PrideMonth, let's recommit to combating anti-LGBTQ violence &amp; finally take action to prevent gun violence. #DisarmHateCruel &amp; completely inconsistent with American values. This could have deadly consequences for families fleeing violence. Disgusting, but not at all surprising for this xenophobic administration. 

https://t.co/6tF1ga3DqmDespite overwhelming public support, the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality starts today. It's imperative that the Internet remains free &amp; open to all.

This is great news for him and his family. But there is still more work to do and we're not done fighting on their behalf. Incredible job by @LegalAidNYC! https://t.co/jkGk3toafmMr. Villavicencio is a hardworking family man - he shouldn't be in custody. @NydiaVelazquez and I are asking ICE's New York Field Office to grant his stay of removal &amp; release him immediately so that he can return to his wife &amp; daughters in Hempstead. https://t.co/PfXDa14btRThe VA's motto overlooks the service and sacrifice of women veterans. I proposed an amendment that would fix that, but it was never brought to the floor. Read More: https://t.co/M3hwsTt4aIThe brave women who serve our country and the families of those who gave their lives defending it deserve to be a part of an organization that recognizes their service and sacrifice. It baffles that any Member of Congress would disagree.The number of women veterans in our country continues to rise, but still the VA’s official motto excludes women. That’s not right &amp; I tried to fix it, but my amendment was never brought to the floor for debate, let alone a vote.Pablo’s detention represents everything that is wrong with the President’s immigration policy. Pablo did nothing wrong and posed no danger, but still this administration is more concerned with locking up a hardworking father of two than combating actual threats to our security.Pablo Villavicencio’s arrest is outrageous and unacceptable. My office has been working with his wife Sandra, a resident of #NY04, and we've been in contact with ICE &amp; USCIS. We’ve assured Sandra that we’ll do everything in our power to stop his deportation and bring him home.55 years after passing the #EqualPayAct, the #paygap still exists &amp; harms working families. We must pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct to close loopholes &amp; ensure equal pay without delay to all women. https://t.co/k9LUBxjjVPHistory made in America's largest township. Happy #PrideMonth! https://t.co/kx6Myx3LMvAnd yesterday a @StateDept spox mentioned D-Day as an example of our strong relationship with Germany. Our allies -- who are vital to our own national security -- look to us for strong, steady and thoughtful leadership... and this is what they get. https://t.co/xYdHCaqOqRI've had the pleasure of meeting many WWII vets in #NY04. Anyone who's had that privilege knows why we call them the greatest generation. Today, we honor the courage and sacrifice of those who led the fight to liberate Europe. #DDay74When it comes to practicing law, honesty and integrity is everything. That’s why I joined @tedlieu in asking the Georgia State Bar to open an ethics investigation into @realDonaldTrump's lawyer Jay Sekulow. https://t.co/qmPjHzpVlvThat being said, the only way to ensure LGBTQ Americans are protected from discrimination — whether it’s in a bakery or in housing, employment or public education — is to pass the Equality Act.Today's #MasterpieceCakeshop ruling is disappointing, but it is NOT the sweeping "license to discriminate" that anti-LGBTQ extremists were looking for. SCOTUS affirmed LGBTQ civil rights &amp; acknowledged LGBTQ people have a right to live free from the indignity of discrimination.Acompáñanos en el foro sobre el Programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA).

Thank you to @LGBTProgress for your advocacy &amp; leadership. https://t.co/vYhvYM8B97Joined fellow former prosecutor @RepTedLieu today to call for an FBI investigation into whether Russia funneled money through the #NRA to illegally support American political campaigns.

His goal is to become a Licensed Master/Clinical Social Worker. I’m so proud of Justice for his commitment to improving the foster care system. https://t.co/qJcrCtg9A9Happy #HarveyMilkDay! Fun fact: Milk grew up in Woodmere &amp; taught for a year at George W. Hewlett HS in #NY04 before becoming the first openly gay elected official in CA. Let's honor Milk's legacy by supporting LGBTQ youth &amp; resisting hateful efforts to unravel LGBTQ progress. https://t.co/UmzEVKlUCiThe President of the United States is blatantly demanding an investigation for his own “Political Purposes.” This is a moment of truth for DOJ &amp; FBI’s leadership, for the rule of law &amp; for American democracy. https://t.co/JTMfbQKq6qTrump-Pence Admin continues to put their personal political views ahead of women’s health care &amp; reproductive rights. Attacking @PPact &amp; restricting what doctors can discuss with their patients is irresponsible &amp; dangerous. #ProtectTitleX #NoGagRule https://t.co/TEpkE2fUaOLast night I signed the #QueenoftheHill discharge petition to force debate on four immigration bills. @SpeakerRyan’s refusal to bring up a vote on DACA is shameful &amp; cruel. We need to pass a long-term bipartisan solution to #ProtectDreamers.It takes tremendous courage for women to stand up &amp; say they've been harassed, assaulted or abused by powerful men. They often face intimidation, they risk their careers &amp; reputations. They are heroes who deserve to be heard, deserve to be believed, &amp; deserve justice.It’s clear @realDonaldTrump's travel ban is unconstitutional, fuels xenophobia, and does not make us more secure. Hopeful that SCOTUS will reject it. #NoMuslimBanEverPleased to see a third federal judge reject the Trump Administration's decision to end DACA, but it’s still on Speaker Ryan &amp; @HouseGOP to bring up a vote on a bipartisan legislative solution to guarantee protection for Dreamers. #DreamersDeserveAVote

It’s long past time to close the wage gap for all women. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/YcqzB2ZpML#NY04 resident Mark Sokolow &amp; his co-plaintiffs deserve justice. Extremely disappointed that the Trump admin denied them their right to hold their attackers accountable. Will continue to stand with the victims in this fight. https://t.co/EIqoH4nBFUDr. King challenged all of us to listen to our conscience as Americans &amp; as human beings. 50 years after his assassination, his legacy challenges us every day to live by our conscience, to fight for justice &amp; equality, &amp; to do what is right because it is right. #MLK50 https://t.co/WSdygjlWiUToday we commemorate #VietnamWarVeteransDay. Vietnam veterans are heroes who deserve our respect, our gratitude, &amp; our unwavering commitment to provide the comprehensive care, benefits &amp; support that all veterans have earned.Rallied with students at #MarchForOurLives in Long Beach #NY04.

https://t.co/hld5wBXGg4More than 21,000 #Dreamers have already lost their DACA protections. Although renewal applications are still being accepted, young immigrants will continue to lose their status in the months ahead because it takes USCIS three to five months to process renewals.Today is the deadline @realDonaldTrump set to end #DACA. Because of SCOTUS’s decision last week, DACA recipients can still renew their status—but until Congress passes a permanent solution, thousands will lose their work permits and risk deportation every day. #ProtectDreamersMajor Nor'easter headed toward Long Island tonight. Expecting heavy rain, high winds, severe flooding, and a wintry mix into early Saturday. Be prepared &amp; stay safe.
https://t.co/zGC0jTWfCxWishing everyone in #NY04 a Happy Purim!Thank you for your letters. I encourage all students in #NY04 to keep speaking up &amp; making your voices heard. @MargueriteIzzo @racheligross https://t.co/mnvfM1kAMJ90 5th graders at @DAVintermediate in Lynbrook sent us letters in response to the #Parkland shooting.

This has happened to eighteen schools.” -Montanino, 5th gradeYesterday I joined a bipartisan effort to force a vote on expanding background checks and closing loopholes. We all agree violent criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses shouldn't be able to buy guns. That's already the law. So let's do our jobs and enforce it.Please join us for a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Information Session on Tuesday, March 13th at 6:30pm.

SCOTUS must reaffirm public sector unions’ right to join together and collectively bargain for better wages and benefits. #JanusvAFSCMEIf Congress had a shred of the courage we're seeing from #Parkland survivors &amp; students across America, we wouldn't still be debating whether there's anything we can do to prevent gun violence.

When I found out what happened in Texas, I thought about how peaceful &amp; protected I feel in church.The decision was made by our military. Who are you talking to? What are you talking about? Do you even know? https://t.co/vQ1afw426ATrump knows he's not supposed to interfere with DOJ &amp; FBI.

Or do they not like the "optics" after #LasVegasShooting? https://t.co/2CNGqidI5tWe can't save every life lost to gun violence in America, but we know we can save some. The question is whether we care enough to try.My thoughts on the Las Vegas shooting: https://t.co/WWiEl2ftqT https://t.co/8l0ylV4bHuWishing all those observing #YomKippur a meaningful &amp; easy fast.

Eager to see details of GOP plan, but this isn't a good sign. https://t.co/Vn1Z0GuLrB#TaxReform done right wouldn't eliminate state &amp; local tax deduction that middle-class families depend on.

Trump would love nothing more than to defy a judge's order without facing consequences.Week after siding w/ white supremacists &amp; neo-Nazis, Trump pardoned sheriff who defied judge’s order to stop racial profiling. #ArpaioPardonNo justification for #ArpaioPardon. No remorse, no rehabilitation, no injustice. Just Trump trying to divide Americans any way he can.Praying for all those in the path of #HurricaneHarvey &amp; all the 1st responders working round the clock to keep people safe.Seems pretty obvious that Trump read his lawyer's secessionist propaganda email: https://t.co/EaK6qHIa8U https://t.co/IoiSkNVh7WThis isn't going to end well..... https://t.co/Ud4dnf956tWow. “You cannot be against Gen. Lee &amp; be for Gen. Washington, there literally is no difference between the two men” https://t.co/amziuAwLBYPresident Trump is a racist. Period. He's gone out of his way to make that clear, so let's not tip-toe around it. He's a racist.In the aftermath of #Charlottesville, @HomelandDems again call for hearings on the ongoing threat of domestic terrorism https://t.co/CMWVXLFAb0Of course Trump is back to blaming "both sides." This is what he does. This is who he is.Hard to take Trump's condemnations seriously when he has alt-right leaders serving in his admin. #FireBannon #FireMiller #FireGorkaPOTUS shouldn't need 2 days of deliberation to decide that "racism is evil."Armed racists march in #Charlottesville &amp; #NRA's leadership says nothing. I'm not intimidated &amp; I'm not going anywhere. https://t.co/fCpUwN39kSDisgusted by the display of white supremacy in #Charlottesville. Grateful to 1st responders working to keep the public safe.I'm just going to say it. #NRA &amp; @DLoesch are quickly becoming domestic security threats under President Trump. We can't ignore that.So if a white guy was shot dead during a routine stop w/ a legal gun &amp; a joint in his car, #NRA would stay silent? You're the ones lying. https://t.co/K1KkN4SbJsAbsolutely right. They're not even trying to hide it at this point. 🚨🚨🚨 https://t.co/3YsbkZfavgWe all know Trump wants to thank Putin. The question is: for what? https://t.co/xhshz6hk8zThis is insulting to US diplomats. Also really, really stupid. Diplomats don't get fired for getting kicked out of a hostile foreign country https://t.co/xhshz6hk8zNominating an Ambassador to #SouthKorea should've been a priority for the Trump admin months ago. Even more urgent now. https://t.co/bzLNSldCNcTrump Org had to prove they looked for US workers before seeking visas, so ran 2 ads saying "No tips" &amp; "Apply by fax." Fax # didn't work. https://t.co/XWPhzsS5HzWhat we need right now is a disciplined leader who's prepared to manage a national &amp; international security crisis. What we have is Trump. https://t.co/uIjzLVdjvjThis sounds more like a statement from the "Supreme Leader" of North Korea than from the President of the United States. https://t.co/ZHOPtXt6qbUN sanctions resolution was a positive step. But why have you still not nominated an Ambassador to South Korea after 200+ days? https://t.co/8qwweVwg94Excited to announce the Congressional App Challenge for #NY04 students!

Hard to imagine any other human (?) coming up with these words. https://t.co/ZVwqCGlMSJBeyond the pale. #NRA is a disgrace to the Constitution they claim to defend. Lunatics actively encouraging violence against free press. https://t.co/fh9kMPmWXSVisited @northropgrumman's Bethpage facility yesterday to meet w/ employees from #NY04 &amp; learn more about AEA systems. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/ppef31bHDhGreat conversation last night w/ @LB_LATINOCIVIC about what's happening in Congress &amp; what it means for communities in #NY04. https://t.co/uDxcCcaW7JWhat world are we living in when "senior Scouts source" has more credibility than the POTUS? https://t.co/90xZSAnq5IAnd we're supposed to believe Trump knew NOTHING about this meeting &amp; was just trying to protect his son. Give me a break.NYT breaks Don Jr./Russia story. Jr. wants to be honest (reportedly). But Trump DICTATES Jr.'s response, which is soon proved to be false.Trump elected Pres., refuses to acknowledge Russian interference. No one tells him there's an email confirming Russian interference.Trump &amp; Jr. spend a yr saying claims of Russian interference "fake news." No one ever tells Trump they have an email proving this is false.Not like they weren't talking during this time. They were 3 of his top campaign advisers, &amp; want us to believe this mtg never even came up.NONE of them even mentions this to DJT. No "hey Jr. what'd you do today?" "Nothing Dad, met some Russians but just about adoption." Nothing.(We have *NO* reason to believe anything we've heard about what was/wasn't said, considering the credibility of those involved.)So FreDon, JK, PM meet w/ this Russian lawyer, former Soviet counterintel officer, alleged Russian money launderer, who knows who else.Don Jr. said "I love it," &amp; invited Kushner &amp; Manafort, who accepted the invitation. These are three TOP advisers to candidate Trump.British knucklehead emailed (American knucklehead) Don Jr. in June '16 offering dirt on HRC as part of Russia &amp; its govt's support for TrumpBasically this is what the Trump admin wants us to believe about the Don Jr./Russia meeting... #TrumpRussiaSo Trump's advisors wanted to be "truthful" about Jr./Russia meeting, but then Trump got involved &amp; decided to do the opposite. Shocking. https://t.co/PXGC05djvhGuys, maybe it's just me, but I have a hard time believing Trump only found out about the Don Jr./Russia meeting a few weeks ago.Got to spend time with some amazing kids today at @ViscardiCenter! Thanks so much for having me &amp; for the tremendous work you do! https://t.co/xX1wzHUwTxDay in the life. Worth noting there are men from both parties who don't act like this. So we've got that going for us, which is nice. https://t.co/8oJT7rNT0wTrump admin needs to prioritize nomination of an experienced DHS Sec ready to take a tough, smart, bipartisan approach to homeland security.Often disagree with Sec. #Kelly, but at least he's a serious adult. Genuinely hope he brings some order &amp; discipline to this reality TV WH....Talk all you want about "law &amp; order." Long Islanders &amp; Americans know you are trying to dismantle the rule of law &amp; we won't allow it. https://t.co/pl3NlSCHnoa) No, it wasn't. b) You're a liar so your promises &amp; oaths mean nothing. c) That speech was a travesty… https://t.co/9wR0vyMXbk.@SallyQYates: "...The very foundation of our justice system — the rule of law — depends on it." https://t.co/Sqi1uR5yI0.@SallyQYates: "We all have a responsibility to protect our Justice Department’s ability to do its job free from interference..." https://t.co/BVniElpQHL.@SallyQYates says what so many of us who have worked at DOJ are feeling right now. Couldn't agree more. https://t.co/x7RjcLWsnZTrump is an incompetent liar, &amp; GOP rushing to make him happy by voting after midnight to take health care away from millions #SkinnyRepeal https://t.co/TawhoYrqQGNothing funny about this. A reality show presidency can't govern the greatest democracy in the world, let alone handle a major crisis. https://t.co/1HrNhv4mMM#TrumpsGOP: "I will vote for this disaster only if I have an ironclad guarantee that it will never become law."If you're worried #SkinnyRepeal could actually become law but still vote for it, you're afraid of/beholden to Trump. No other explanation.Again: then DON'T PASS IT. Why would anyone vote for a bill if they're "very worried" it might become law?? https://t.co/Yus9XXY6g8Solution for Senators who are "very worried about this": DON'T PASS THE BILL! https://t.co/J7eo16SgR2Remember when a bunch of House Republicans said they'd vote for #Trumpcare so that the Senate could improve it?#Trumpcare process shows how Trump's secrecy, lies &amp; incompetence infect our entire democratic process. GOP has happily adopted his playbookIt's almost as if they think DOJ exists to protect Trump &amp; serve his political agenda. https://t.co/0KIXQqijF7Disturbing but telling that Trump admin thinks DOJ's priorities should be immigration &amp; leaks. https://t.co/JIIpZbO3oy https://t.co/1NODYB0aqKKyle's from #NY04, 1 of many active duty troops insulted by their Commander-in-Chief today. Grateful for his service. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/nhtYiCZlb5Anyone who wants to serve &amp; is fit to serve should be welcomed with gratitude &amp; respect. That's really all there is to it.Trump celebrates House GOP's "American Heroes Week 2017" by attacking transgender people who answer the call of duty https://t.co/jI5mLuwFX1Another Trump lie: "I'll do everything in my power to protect our #LGBTQ citizens." Maybe he thought the T stood for Trump?Another day, another revelation of a blatant Russia-related lie from #Sessions &amp; the Trump admin. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/z17d0weQIfIf Trump dares fire Mueller, Congress must re-establish independent counsel the same day. Anything less would make GOP (even more) complicitWonder why?
