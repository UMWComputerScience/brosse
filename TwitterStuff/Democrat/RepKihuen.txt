Proud to see hundreds of Nevadans at the Keep Families Together rally in Downtown Las Vegas speaking out against President Trump’s cruel, inhumane and immoral family separations! We will not stop until we #EndFamilyDetention &amp; #KeepFamiliesTogether! #FamiliasUnidasNoDivididas https://t.co/6GzQfsfVy3Thank you to everyone who attended our discussion on family separations — especially to Estefany &amp; Marjorie for sharing their powerful story of being separated from their mother at the border. So proud to see our community committed to #EndFamilyDetention &amp; #KeepFamilesTogether! https://t.co/l46x0p4HBiHappy 43rd wedding anniversary to my parents. They sacrificed it all so that their children could live the American Dream. This is why I fight every day so that others can have the opportunities we’ve had. #KeepFamiliesTogether 

¡Feliz aniversario, papá y mamá! Los quiero mucho. https://t.co/OMqoFFJQayEl día de hoy me estaré reuniendo con líderes comunitarios y familias afectadas por la política de “tolerancia cero” del Presidente Trump. Estaré hablando de mi visita a la frontera y que debemos hacer como comunidad para mantener a #FamiliasUnidasNoDivididas. https://t.co/2yI0RZUxNFLooking forward to meeting w/ constituents to discuss my recent trip to the border &amp; the latest on President Trump’s “zero tolerance” policies that have separated over 2K children from their parents. Our community must come together to #KeepFamilesTogether &amp; #EndFamilyDetention. https://t.co/BzcFaFpzMuMy heart goes out to everyone injured &amp; the families of those lost in today’s shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Congress must take action to prevent gun violence. This can’t continue to be the new normal in America.  #EndGunViolence https://t.co/kXu8LOwaARProductive meeting with @ANCA_DC to discuss the US-Armenian relationship. Over 20K Armenian-Americans call Nevada home and make significant contributions to our community. It’s always a pleasure seeing my good friend, the Honorary Consul of Armenia in Las Vegas, Andy Armenian. https://t.co/kNp9hCGmdmLas familias separadas y el pueblo Americano merecen respuestas acerca del plan de reunificación del Presidente Trump. Cada día que se mantiene separadas sufren dolor y trauma. Esta es la razón por la cual me adhiero a mis colegas en el congreso para exigir respuestas inmediatas. https://t.co/kHqjdFjdIjThe families torn apart and the American people deserve answers about @realDonaldTrump’s plan for reunification. Every day that family members are kept from one another they experience more pain and trauma. This is why I joined my colleagues to demand answers immediately. https://t.co/nAOjQc9KeVAs the proud son &amp; brother of union workers, I know first-hand the benefits unions provide to working class families in Nevada. Today’s #JanusDecision is an attack on American workers &amp; undermines the vital role unions play in creating economic prosperity. https://t.co/uclscrPpaCGreat catching up with you, my friend! It was a pleasure meeting Ellen and Candy. Thank you all for advocating on behalf of Americans with disabilities. https://t.co/35Ce7g2BHaOn #LGBTQ Equality Day, I urge my colleagues to pass the Equality Act which would extend existing civil rights protections to LGBTQ people by prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity across key areas of life. #EqualityForward https://t.co/xe4aPjj4u7I'm fighting for #NetNeutrality by forcing a vote in the House and reversing Trump @FCC’s repeal to gut these protections. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/BSin11q2TQHere at #SCOTUS standing in solidarity w/ our Muslim brothers &amp; sisters. The United States is better than this #MuslimBan. The United States I know is willing to give an opportunity to anyone who’s willing to come here, work hard &amp; sacrifice to achieve American Dream.#NoBanNoWall https://t.co/Q1f9qYzU9SVoting is a right, not a privilege. In the past 5 years, more than two dozen states have enacted anti-voter laws that make it harder to register and harder to cast your ballot. It’s time to #RestoreTheVOTE
https://t.co/i25E6zJ1DWHablé con @TsitsikiFelix en @Perspectiva_Nac @Univision de mi visita a la frontera, la política cruel e inhumana de “tolerancia cero” del Presidente Trump y la separación de familias inocentes, y el proyecto de ley que presentamos para resolver este problema. #FamiliasUnidas https://t.co/tdrKTU0tZWWishing my constituent and good friend, Pastor José Pagan, a very happy and healthy 62nd birthday! 

¡Feliz cumpleaños, Pastor Pagan! Muchas gracias por todo su servicio a nuestra comunidad de Las Vegas. #NV04 https://t.co/B7lofRboQdDue Process is the bedrock of the U.S. Constitution — it is the demarcation line between democratic freedoms &amp; dictatorships, and all persons on U.S. soil are entitled to these protections. @realDonaldTrump is calling for the suspension of the Constitution he is sworn to uphold. https://t.co/zTjbUPejlSEnjoyed attending the 25th annual Latino Youth Leadership Conference in Las Vegas. I participated in this conference as a young person and I’m proud to come back every year to meet the future leaders of our country! #LYLC #LYLC2018 https://t.co/L7vNSrOmgHThank YOU for being out there and fighting to keep families together! https://t.co/wdOVAcGwlIStanding in solidarity with thousands of Nevadans in sending a message to @realDonaldTrump that separating innocent children from their parents is cruel, inhumane and un-American. Mr. President, #KeepFamiliesTogether! https://t.co/TAqKWNR9V8Today, I was proud to vote in support of bipartisan legislation that will help combat the opioid crisis in Nevada and all across the country. The opioid epidemic is considered the deadliest drug crisis in U.S. history and we must do everything possible to fight it. #NV04 https://t.co/6fOGR1P54pIt was great meeting w/ constituent and fellow Nevadan Athulya Nath and her colleagues who are visiting Washington D.C. to participate in @RunningStart, an organization dedicated to educating women to participate in politics and run for elected office. #ILookLikeAPolitician #NV04 https://t.co/Ft7NA0d1x2Entrevista con @TsitsikiFelix en @PerspectivaNac para hablar de la separación de familias en la frontera, la política de “tolerancia cero” del Presidente Trump, y el proyecto de ley que presentamos para resolver este problema. Sintoniza @Univision este domingo para la entrevista. https://t.co/5ciouJYnbGGreat conversation with @Perspectiva_Nac @Univision to discuss my visit to the border &amp; the #familyseparation crisis, President Trump’s cruel &amp; inhumane zero tolerance policy, and how the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act introduced by my colleagues &amp; me this week can solve this problem. https://t.co/cleGPH55Q3Voted against the #FarmBill because instead of helping millions of Americans struggling w/ food insecurity, this bill callously takes away #SNAP benefits from those who need it most, including single mothers, seniors, individuals with disabilities and rural &amp; native communities. https://t.co/l6CYQWTfeYTeam Kihuen was honored to be in attendance at the official change of command ceremony at the Hawthorne Army Depot. Thank you to outgoing Lt. Col. Scott Bishop for his service to our state and welcome to incoming Lt. Col. Dustin Bishop. #NV04 #Hawthorne https://t.co/3KDpeC319QProud to vote against this extreme anti-immigrant bill because it fails to  #protectDREAMers, makes family reunification more difficult, ends the diversity visa lottery program, and provides billions of dollars for Trump’s border wall. #KeepFamiliesTogether #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/EArxz0MrnwLa orden ejecutiva de Trump no resuelve el conflicto que él mismo creo. No elimina su política de “cero tolerancia”, no proporciona una solución a la reunificación de familias y continua criminalizando a familias que lo único que buscan es refugio ante violencia y persecución. https://t.co/FjGngfpxNSI encourage my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats on a permanent solution to end this crisis by passing the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue – this is a human rights issue. I’ll continue fighting tirelessly to #KeepFamilesTogether.Trump’s executive order does nothing to solve the crisis he created. It does not end the zero tolerance policy. It does not provide a solution for family reunification &amp; it continues to criminalize innocent families seeking refuge from violence &amp; persecution #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/xJDJBfLLfQHoy presentamos el Acta Mantener a las Familias Unidas. Este proyecto de ley establece una preferencia por la unidad de la familia,disuade la separación de hermanos y crea la presunción concluyente de que los centros de detención no son de beneficio para las familias y los ninos. https://t.co/53O7FFtH3ZJoining my colleagues in introducing the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to stop #familyseparations. This bill establishes a preference for family unity, discourages the separation of siblings, and creates a presumption that detention is not in the best interests of families &amp; children. https://t.co/E3GWnoIFkuEsta mañana en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos acompañé a niños y niñas, papás y mamás, a mi amigo @RepGutierrez y otros colegas para exigirle al Presidente Trump que elimine esta política cruel e inhumana que está separando a familias inocentes. #FamiliasUnidasNoDivididas https://t.co/rSxoXbROZWI'm proud to join children, parents and colleagues on the U.S. Capitol steps to demand that @realdonaldtrump rescind his cruel, inhumane and un-American "zero tolerance" policy that tears children and parents apart! #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/oDt0EeOoW1On #worldrefugeeday the U.S. must uphold our leadership position in the World and stop tearing families apart along our Southern Border. I stand with these families who are seeking shelter from violence and persecution. Let’s show compassion, not vilification https://t.co/aHXu9MX6i7I'm proud to join my colleagues in cosponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct since @realDonaldTrump refuses to end the inhumane practice of ripping children away from their families. https://t.co/h0cMBmqpbcAs we celebrate #Juneteenth, our work to eradicate deeply ingrained and systemic racial injustice continues. Every person deserves fair and equal protection under the law so that the American Dream is within reach. “Let us march on til victory is won.” https://t.co/bAjGYKsoWEYesterday, I saw separated families at detention centers on the U.S. border. @realDonaldTrump and @SecNielsen should be ashamed for holding children hostage and using them as bargaining chips. America is better than this. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/IRlsgu9CZCVisited the US-Mexico border close to where my family &amp; I crossed 30 years ago. Can’t imagine that day when we crossed, at 8 years old, being separated from my parents in a country I didn’t know. Ripping children &amp; parents apart is cruel, inhumane &amp; goes against American values. https://t.co/PUB36BwyjCVisiting these detention facilities today and seeing innocent kids separated from their parents has truly been heartbreaking &amp; emotionally draining. We were not allowed to snap photos of the children/parents, so I took these from outside the refugee center &amp; detention facilities. https://t.co/4w68CddKjKEstoy en la frontera exigiéndole al Presidente Trump que termine esta póliza cruel e inhumana que ha separado a más de 2,000 niños de sus padres. Debemos hacer todo lo posible para mantener a nuestras familias unidas. https://t.co/80UNhyN1qbSpeaking at a press conference at the San Diego border calling on @realDonaldTrump to rescind his inhumane and cruel family separation policy. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. This is a humanitarian issue. We must do everything to #KeepFamiliesTogether! https://t.co/oIcb0SnUGAEn rumbo a la frontera de San Diego para analyzar la situación de los niños que están siendo separados de sus padres y para presionar a @realDonaldTrump a que termine con esta póliza que es cruel, inhumana y que va en contra de todos los valores de este gran país. https://t.co/9E3FNZ80E8On the way to the San Diego border to get a firsthand view of the children detention facilities in the region &amp; to demand that @realDonaldTrump end his cruel, inhumane &amp; un-American policies that have already torn 2,000 children apart from their parents! #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/ZH7FJEgGCcEnjoyed joining former Nevada governor &amp; U.S. senator Richard Bryan in kicking-off the 1st ever MobWorld Summit @TheMobMuseum. Always honored listening to &amp; learning from 1 of the best public servants in NV history. Congrats on a great event Larry, Judy &amp; Barbara.#LasVegasHistory https://t.co/FWhWR2sofZIt’s hard to celebrate #FathersDay knowing that innocent children have been ripped apart from their parents at the border. These actions taken by the Trump Administration are immoral, inhumane &amp; against our American values. America is better than this! https://t.co/68vgdqDFxs@sueqhaslett @RubenKihuen They still have a chance, but they definitely didn’t look like world champions today. I have Germany going first and Mexico second in the group. That may have flipped now lol...It was an honor to join the local Las Vegas Muslim community tonight in celebrating #EidAlFitr. Wishing happiness and peace to everyone celebrating around the world. Eid Mubarak! 🌙 https://t.co/y325S2C9CtGreat news. Still praying for my good friend and wishing him a full and speedy recovery. Welcome home, Senator Reid. https://t.co/A1L6fhbGGSAs a lifelong soccer player &amp; fan, here are my two cents on the World Cup. I filled out this bracket the day before the World Cup started. Great games so far!

Como futbolista, aquí les comparto mis predicciones para el #Mundial. Creo que Brasil ganará su sexto mundial. #WorldCup https://t.co/zKfw1lqho2Had the honor of meeting with heroes of the #1Oct shooting. These @AMR_Social EMTs were the first to respond to the scene and saved many lives. They were honored by the @amerambassoc with the #StarsofLife Award. Las Vegas is truly grateful for their service and heroic acts. #NV04 https://t.co/0AuGBeSztr.@USOCC Comptroller Otting said he’s NEVER observed discrimination of any kind in the US. Apparently @realDonaldTrump‘s appointee has been living under a rock his entire life. Disturbing answer from regulator charged with protecting against lending discrimination. #OCCnoColor https://t.co/mP5B0zcLCVSending my best wishes to all those celebrating Eid al-Fitr and the end of Ramadan. #EidMubarak https://t.co/IxpQqWJLJmAt the congressional baseball game representing Nevada with my friend and colleague, Congressman @MarkAmodeiNV2! #OneNevada #VegasBorn #congressionalbaseball https://t.co/Ep2Son32C6Happy #NationalFlagDay and happy 243rd birthday, @USArmy!

I’m happy to hear that my colleague Congressman @SteveScalise will be back on the field tonight for the 2018 @TheHillBaseball. https://t.co/igr9osvdUfActions taken by the Trump Administration to unjustifiably separate harmless children from their parents are immoral, inhumane and against our American values! These innocent families deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. #KeepFamiliesTogether
 https://t.co/rV67LrZ981I was proud to honor and congratulate the Vegas @GoldenKnights players, coaches, owners &amp; fans on a historic inaugural season. Thank you for uniting and lifting up our city when we needed you the most. We are forever #VegasBorn &amp; #VegasStrong! #GoKnightsGo https://t.co/hJ57em14lOIt is heartless and simply wrong for the Trump Administration to block victims of gang violence and domestic abuse from claiming asylum in our country. I stand with those seeking refuge and believe that we must use our leadership position in the world to help these victims https://t.co/Rxb6EcmCQaThanks for stopping by!

I look forward to working with them to combat these important issues. https://t.co/icbd2nOIrhThe Trump DOJ is trying to take protections away from the 1,215,300 Nevadans with pre-existing conditions. No one should face this discrimination. We should be making it easier for people to access health care, not harder. #ProtectOurCare
