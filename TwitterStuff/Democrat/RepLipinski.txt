The House has added my amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act which will expand a program that brings the best minds at our universities together with American innovators from Silicon Valley and elsewhere to solve critical problems and strengthen America's defense. (2/2)America leads the world in #technology and #innovation, but we need to do more to apply this strength to our national defense. (1/2) @Hacking4DefenseI was pleased to welcome the Third Congressional District’s winner of the 2018 Congressional #Art Competition and her family to Washington this week. @NazarethLGP sophomore and #WillowSprings resident Gianna Imbarrato's drawing was unveiled at the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/fGvZyBuhHtThanks to everyone who is on Capitol Hill today for #NetNeutrality #AdvocacyDay. We must make it clear that a majority of Americans want a free and open #Internet, and that it's up to us in Congress to restore #NetNeutrality.Joining @RepLouCorrea to ask the DHS and HHS Inspector Generals to investigate what the agencies are doing to reconnect separated kids with their families. DHS &amp; HHS not having a plan to reconnect children with parents makes a horrible situation even worse. https://t.co/zrHVSupD69Trump’s #executiveorder today on border family separations is a poorly executed attempt to reverse a sloppily-crafted and harmful policy. The President needs to do better by the American people, recognize the gravity of his office, and think his actions through.Over the next few weeks, I will be hosting a Town Hall Meeting, a Veterans Fair, and two Senior Fairs in the Third Congressional District. As your representative in Washington, it is important that I hear from you. https://t.co/H1W56sObR6No one should be intimidated or harassed out of a promising career or academic field. Congress needs to make it clear that sexual #harassment will not be tolerated. (2/2)The National Academies has released a major report on sexual #harassment of women in academic #sciences, #engineering, and medicine that contains important recommendations, such as better protecting sexual harassment claimants from retaliation. (1/2)When our nation’s leaders dismiss the impact of their actions on parents and children, we lose sight of our principles and what this nation stands for. (3/3)The Administration should ensure that their policies do not result in needless and traumatic separation of children from their families. No bond is as precious and vital as that between a child and their parent. (2/3)I am deeply concerned about children being separated from their parents at border crossings. Enforcing our laws is important, but we must do it right and we must respect human rights. (1/3)Happy #FlagDay! This day is an important reminder to respect and honor our flag which brave men and women have fought and died under since the birth of our nation. My offices accept worn-out flags throughout the year for proper retirement. https://t.co/ynt8k0ymLAGreat to meet @David_Yarnold, President and CEO of the National Audubon Society, this evening. Thanks to the @AudubonSociety for the important conservation work they do, and for their support of my Challenges and Prizes for Climate Act. https://t.co/cpYeb28MmPToday, the FCC’s disastrous #NetNeutrality repeal takes effect. The Senate already passed a bill to restore Net Neutrality and I’ve signed the discharge petition that would force a vote on it in the House.At a retirement celebration this afternoon for long-time @BrotherRice High School Principal Jim Antos, I presented him with a copy of a statement I made in the Congressional Record honoring and thanking him.

The park is named after Mark Muehe, who was killed in the Vietnam War at the age of 21. You hear the word “hero” thrown around a lot these days. Mark is a real #hero. https://t.co/5wkHJeqE8eToday, I signed a letter telling @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryPerry not to subsidize failing power plants, a proposal Trump's own appointees at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have rejected. Their plan will raise rates for no benefit. https://t.co/D2bBVf0MsnPleased to meet in DC this week with local transit leader Ken Franklin, President of ATU Local #308.

The group included many veterans of the Korean War and two who served in #WWII. Personally thanking our #veterans was a great way to commemorate #DDay. https://t.co/KoY1vpESWOI’m pleased to see that the @NWS is now hiring at a rate slightly greater than its retirements, but they must do much more. All Americans depend on the #weather data they provide, and I question their ability to continue to do that with hundreds of unfilled vacancies.Proud to announce $132 million in funding to the CREATE Program for the 75th Street Corridor Improvement Project. This investment will help separate several freight and passenger rail lines in the Englewood, Auburn Gresham, and West Chatham neighborhoods. https://t.co/adQJPwXSIO https://t.co/2rvSjLtKc9One of the more unique events in the district that I enjoy attending every year is the #LaGrange Pet Parade.

Congratulations to all of the graduates, their family and friends, and everyone on the Horizon team. https://t.co/eE21Vna1xv@EPA submitted its proposal to roll back clean car standards, even though 7 in 10 Americans oppose this move. I have shared my opposition with the EPA and will continue to fight this harmful decision.Services announced for Chicago Fire Department diver who died during rescue call https://t.co/8YlbX2rsBESometimes we take our first responders for granted, but they are heroes, putting their lives on the line for us every day. I ask that you keep Juan, his family, and the entire fire department community in your prayers. (3/3)The 46-year-old joined the department in 2003, and became a member of the dive team in 2007. He lived in the Clearing neighborhood, a tight-knit community I grew up in on the Southwest Side. He leaves behind two sons, just 9 and 7. (2/3)My prayers and thoughts are with the family of Chicago firefighter Juan Bucio, who passed away late last night attempting a rescue on the South Branch of the Chicago River as part of the fire department’s dive team. (1/3)I joined Crest Hill Mayor Soliman this afternoon for the city's 30th Annual Veteran and Police Memorial Garden Ceremony. I appreciate the mayor, his staff, and many others for providing an opportunity for everyone to come together to remember those who have sacrificed all for us. https://t.co/6UcDYubVDbAn overflow crowd turned out at Orland Park’s Civic Center for the village's #MemorialDay ceremony.

I urge you to share your opinions with @EPA at the link below. https://t.co/JputPTHX88This week, I voted against this bill, which will now undermine the progress we have made in reining in #WallStreet, stopping #bankbailouts, and protecting consumers. (2/2)Only a few years removed from a long economic #recession many of my constituents will never fully recover from, #Congress took up legislation that rolls back #DoddFrank, weakens oversight over financial systems, and removes protections that #middleclass families rely on. (1/2)Working to get Bubbly Creek in #Chicago cleaned up and restored. My amendment that removes a legal obstacle to the project passed out of the House T&amp;I Committee today. I'm looking forward to a day when area residents will be able to enjoy this waterway. https://t.co/48fAD5AQunI have cosponsored new legislation that would repeal the rider and protect the refuge. Time is running out and we can’t let our national treasures be auctioned off to the highest bidder. (2/2)President Eisenhower set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1960 to preserve it as an expansive, unspoiled wilderness for future generations to enjoy. Republicans put a rider into last year’s tax cut bill that allows oil and gas drilling in this unique ecosystem.

Thanks to everyone who came to this evening’s @zoos_aquariums reception in Washington. https://t.co/XIo9I4M2AKThe Senate took a bold step today towards reinstating #NetNeutrality and protecting an open internet. Now it’s time for the House to do its part.We must keep the #internet an open platform so that everyone has equal access; we cannot allow access to be only open to the highest bidder. The #Senate should vote to preserve #NetNeutrality today, and then the #House should swiftly take up and pass the same bill.Great to meet with @TMAInfo Illinois members today. #Manufacturers and their hard-working employees are truly the backbone of our economy. A strong manufacturing sector brings good-paying #jobs to our communities and is essential to a strong #middleclass. https://t.co/r7rLk5WqnDThis is #NationalPoliceWeek.

It also saves money because every car that Metra rehabs internally saves half a million dollars. (2/2)Today I gathered with @Metra officials and local leaders to break ground on an expansion of Metra’s railcar and locomotive rehab shop. Last Congress, I was able to help bring $2.9 billion to #Illinois for public transit  and some of this money is paying for this project.

"This was done extremely quickly, there were no hearings on it and it was negotiated behind closed doors," Lipinski said. "There are things we are going to find out, loopholes that we haven't spotted."I voted against the #taxbill today because it prioritizes corporations and the wealthy over the #middleclass, sunsets individual tax cuts while making corporate cuts permanent, punishes local taxpayers by capping deductions for property and income taxes, and adds more to our debtI'm currently working with my colleagues on a #bipartisan compromise developed by the #ProblemSolvers Caucus that would lower #healthcare costs, and on another plan that would protect #DACA recipients and increase border security.This includes organizations like @GirlsWhoCode, which operates clubs that give girls opportunities to develop skills and build apps through after-school programs.
