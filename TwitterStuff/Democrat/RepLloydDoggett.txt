After speaking at the #FamiliesBelongTogether event in San Antonio, I joined @MSNBC to discuss the inspiring event today, my legislation, &amp; our road ahead to reunite these families. https://t.co/2LXZa1kFsSSpoke against Trump’s family separation this morning at the #FamiliesBelongTogether rally in Main Plaza. I was joined by many concerned San Antonians working to reunite families, standing together against this inhumanity. We won't rest until these children are w/ their mothers. https://t.co/IAGvM0T3fDNOW: Tune in to @MSNBC as I discuss family separation &amp; how we're working to reunite these children #FamiliesBelongTogether@statesman I proposed legislation that would have had the U.S. Justice Department join states and municipalities in suing pharmaceutical companies for reimbursements for their part in creating the opioid crisis, as Texas has done.As I discussed w/ @statesman, the opioids bills the House just passed are like fighting a wildfire with a garden hose. We can’t settle for the appearance of action, rather than real action to confront our Nation’s grave opioid crisis. 
https://t.co/9bUwotQRh8Tomorrow I'll join local immigrant rights leaders to speak out against Trump’s family separation &amp; on my legislation that would have stopped military bases f/ being turned into child internment camps. I'll speak around 10 a.m. in Main Plaza in San Antonio. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/SKyaVvnsBZIn such difficult times, some good news: The separated mother &amp; son, Luisa &amp; Mateo, who I was working to reunite, are, for now, together as they seek asylum. After 5 weeks detained apart. As we celebrate this first step for them, we think of the 2000+ children still imprisoned. https://t.co/FRywwT94lKAs I discuss in this article, the Republican claim that you’ll be able to file your taxes on a postcard is as phony as their claim that their tax scam will mean $4,500 in additional income for every American household. https://t.co/Ux8Scw01HMNo amount of mayhem and murder will move this Congress to act. Change will come only with a change in Congress.Yet another horrifying shooting, this time in Annapolis attacking journalists. This Fourth of July at BBQs and fireworks displays, there will be empty chairs that should have family members but will not because they were lost to gun violence.We seek an America that does not treat children like this. In a step forward, a federal judge ruled that Admin must reunify families.

But we refuse to rest until we verify that each of these kids is out of government custody &amp; back in their mothers’ arms. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/sQ4yOU7yHLPharmaceutical companies like to justify their high prices by saying the money goes toward “innovation” through research and development. Unfortunately, the Pharma innovation is finding new ways to game our patent system and maintain their monopoly power. https://t.co/7vkJ0hHLE7GOP blocked debate on my amendments (joined by 41 colleagues) to keep Trump from using our military bases as child detention camps. This Congress once provided a check on Executive power. But now it’s all lapdog and no watchdog. https://t.co/z5QKtn7MTUOur best hope for a genuine check is to be found at the ballot box to hold those who enable Trump accountable.We are witnessing the dissolution of what should be an effective check on Trump’s power grab and disdain for democratic institutions. Now, we may seldom find that check at the courthouse.Watch my keynote on affordable medicines at @Public_Citizen: https://t.co/Swv5v6SgYmTune in at 11 CT to my keynote at @Public_Citizen “Affordable Medicines Now” conference. It’s long past time to stand up for patients. With little progress being made, the only good news is that there is no shortage of drug pricing ideas that might work. Join as we discuss a few. https://t.co/k7HV9P42pvRepublicans’ new tax filing “postcard” is a scam. Replacing the existing 1040 EZ and short form—already used by 65 million taxpayers—with a two-sided postcard that for many may include schedules on schedules, only adds needless complexity and confusion. https://t.co/RL7rcU2a4NToday is Equality Day, the important anniversary of two Supreme Court decisions affirming marriage equality as the law of the land. We cannot let the Trump Administration pull our LGBTQ family, friends, and neighbors backward, we must push #EqualityForwardThe Senate already passed a resolution to restore #NetNeutrality rules that were repealed by Trump’s Republican-controlled FCC. I signed a petition to try and force a similar vote in the House and restore an open and fair internet.We won’t rest until each one of these children is reunited with their families. The Trump Administration must unlock their cages. #FamiliesBelongTogether  #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/vblvp2I0xdWith no clear plan or timeline to reunite families Trump cruelly separated, groups like @RAICESTEXAS are working to expand programs to help separated families.  In a strong rebuke, over $20 million was raised to expand legal services. https://t.co/Oi60GD1ye5My statement on today’s Supreme Court decision regarding the Texas redistricting case: https://t.co/yuVaAg6YeBChoose human rights over Saudi money. I will continue to push to pass a resolution to remove United States Forces from unauthorized action in Yemen.The Trump Administration is complicit in the horrible crisis in Yemen—an unfolding horror that has not received due attention. We must cease to fund &amp; equip this bloodshed of innocents.
https://t.co/ogTvabVZReI'm advancing an amendment to restrict the Trump Admin f/ housing these children on military bases. I will speak at the National Day of Action next Sat, June 30. We will keep raising our voices to defend these young, distraught children and their mothers. #EndFamilySeparationI thank all those—over 700 of our neighbors—who have spoken out to me about the Trump Admin's cruelty toward families on our border. We must continue working to restrain this anti-immigrant agenda. https://t.co/ryOhLJR7o8The great deal maker is in fact consistently unable to close most any deal—much less a good deal for the American people.
https://t.co/bOnRoalQUH"I don’t care how they try to paint that picture. It’s a horror.” Harrowing reminder from history that losing freedom scars. We cannot let the Trump Administration now create mass detention camps of unfree families.
https://t.co/3vUPSqeh61For the many Texans concerned re Trump’s policy of taking children from their mother’s arms, it's insightful to see 20 Texas Republican Members of Congress &amp; officials declined to respond to a direct question. Apparently, for most, Trump got their tongue.
https://t.co/OGPXoo8xVSA Fox &amp; Friends host on Trump Network said, "Like it or not, these aren't our kids. Show them compassion, but it's not like he is doing this to the people of Idaho or Texas." No. We will only progress as a Nation when we see our own children &amp; grandchildren in every child’s eyes.I’m advancing an amendment to block this—to prevent the Trump Administration from imprisoning separated children on our military bases. https://t.co/TbF3gkR5l9GOP works to make it harder for people w/ pre-existing conditions to afford insurance. If AG Paxton’s dangerous lawsuit to dismantle ACA succeeds, millions of Texans may be charged higher premiums or denied insurance b/c they have a pre-existing condition. https://t.co/oTt09Q2XJNTogether, we can overcome this cruelty. https://t.co/VHmSTieU0WI intro'd a modest bill to ensure taxpayer $ isn't wasted on Rx drugs that are discarded b/c they're only available in over-sized vials. The Ways &amp; Means Cmte unanimously passed my bill. We need to stop this abuse of taxpayer $ and preserve lifesaving meds. https://t.co/1CWZpK0Da5Instead of a bill to build Trump’s wall, GOP needs to build a mirror to see what they have become—willing accomplices to his wrongdoing. Mexico would probably even pay for that. But these children deserve so much better. View my House floor speech here. https://t.co/yyHJuQdP0nI am about to speak on the House floor Republican on the immigration bill. Tune in.The crying, distraught children we heard are still crying and distraught. Trump has produced no plan nor a timetable for their reunification.How nice that that while at least temporarily reversing his family separation policy Trump dispatched his wife, a mother, to visit detained children. They don’t want to see “a” mother. They want THEIR mother.Trump Admin uses a family's love as a weapon in their war on immigrants. And that's a war on the American Dream. Thankful the team at @KVUE worked w/ us to shed light on families the Trump Administration was already separating in Central Texas months ago:
https://t.co/JUPAzLpHsNMy statement on the Trump Executive Order &amp; GOP Bills: https://t.co/pSRK9jEMgbMany of you have taken the time to complete the March For Our Lives postcard calling for reasonable gun safety legislation. I stand with you. So we can communicate more quickly, please feel free to email me at Lloyd.Doggett@mail.house.gov. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/r8yPX3lXdSOn #Juneteenth, we commemorate news of the end of slavery in TX. Today, Trump Admin detains asylum-seeking children in camps. Right here in Texas. There is still so much work to do. As my friend @repjohnlewis says, "Freedom is not a state; it is an act...action we all must take." https://t.co/12Y3qS4XKKThey most certainly are. Trump Admin uses parents’ love for their children as a weapon in their war on immigrants. They intimidate asylum-seekers by tearing children from mothers’ arms &amp; deporting them to their abusers. I won't relent until Trump Admin ends this abusive policy. https://t.co/jL3mQZNTzmAccording to @WSJ, Trump was originally inspired to cancel military training exercises w/ South Korea by none other than…Russian President Vladimir Putin. Unknown whether Putin also recommended the salutes that Trump gave to North Korean Generals. https://t.co/TqOmYbQjLyLast week we hosted a delegation, much like SA to DC, from @AustinChamber. We discussed Trump Admin erosion of democratic institutions &amp; more. I urged them to raise their voices in defense of the powerless—those who are first suffering from the Trump Administration’s wrongs. https://t.co/osl26r24EKWhat horror. https://t.co/jTm9oAheDaNor does Speaker Ryan’s alternative represent moderation. A leaked draft shows it holds Dreamers—&amp; now little detained children—hostage for anti-immigrant provisions. Neither bill appears to do anything to end the cruel Trump policy of tearing children f/ asylum-seeking mothers.2 anti-immigrant bills are up for House Floor action this week. As @washingtonpost Editorial Board says about the bill authored by Reps. McCaul &amp; Goodlatte, known as the Steve Bannon Bill, it “is anti-immigrant fervor distilled into reactionary policy.” https://t.co/YayomBPBR5In times like these, it is important to mark occasions like #Juneteenth, which commemorates the TX announcement of the abolition of slavery. Joined @Oraatx1, @ALTERforATX, @kathietovo, @chief_manley, @KirkPWatson, Dyana Limon-Mercado &amp; so many other friends for #Juneteenth2018. https://t.co/sjcHBlqVvSPart 2: https://t.co/c22sDaCICF"President Trump, he could end this in less time than it took him to salute a North Korean general." Joined @CNN to discuss the Trump Administration's cruel new policy of family separation and how we're working to combat it. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/zLHI4scQgAI'm seeking to restore our compliance w/ Refugee Convention, long ago ratified by the US. The treaty states: “the unity of the family...is an essential right of the refugee." It recommends “governments to take the necessary measures for the protection of the refugee’s family."This Father's Day, as we honor the important role that fathers have, let’s remember the fathers cruelly separated from their children at our border under the outrageous new policy that Trump has imposed. #FamiliesBelongTogether #FathersDay https://t.co/YgsqrWXn3kBut, six years later, Speaker Ryan continues to block consideration of the DREAM Act. Instead, he's pushing us to vote on Trump-endorsed anti-immigrant measures. After years of success and challenges, we need the #DreamActNow.This month marks a 6th anniversary of the successful DACA program—which provided a way for Dreamers to keep studying, working, &amp; contributing to their communities. In his Rose Garden speech announcing DACA, President Obama lauded the bipartisan DREAM Act &amp; urged Congress to act.I’m working to reunite separated families in our area &amp; pursuing every legislative option to block Trump’s policy. We people of good faith to come together, to stand to Trump up on behalf of these little ones. We must end this un-American abuse of asylum-seekers.The scripture cited by Mr. Sessions, to justify tearing children from their mothers, is the kind that’s been twisted by authoritarian governments throughout the ages to justify shameful abuses of power. #FamiliesBelongTogether“I’d just have to say that Jeff Sessions didn’t attend the Sunday School that I did.” Just now, I joined @CNNnewsroom to discuss the cruelty of Trump’s new family separation policy. Our Nation’s shame. https://t.co/9FWMNI3zFb15 MIN: I invite you to tune into @CNNnewsroom with @FWhitfield at noon CST today. I will be speaking out against the Trump Administration's horrible new policy of separating asylum-seeking children and their mothers—and what we can do to end this human rights abuse.It’s almost as if Trump admired the “tough guy,” rather than deploring the dictator's abusive tactics. That includes imprisoning an estimated 120,000 in wretched prison camps. https://t.co/C4ZPECMytGFirst Trump salutes the North Korean general, &amp; responds to a journalist asking about Kim Jong-un’s brutal executions with, “He’s a tough guy.”Shamefully, Trump may be seizing these children to use them like he has used our Dreamers as hostages for building his wall. We must confront the core of the atrocity: the Trump Administration’s systematic war on immigrants.GOP Sen. Lindsay Graham gave the game away today: Contrary to Trump’s lie that Democrats made him do it, Trump could end his family separation policy w/ a phone call. But he won’t because—as he also admits—it was put in place to intimidate asylum-seekers. https://t.co/k3N0fHBXj0This weekend, Libby and I once again enjoyed participating in the annual Chisholm Trail Roundup Grand Parade in Lockhart, which celebrates the town’s historic place on the Chisholm Trail. Congratulations to the City of Lockhart for another successful Chisholm Trail Roundup! https://t.co/hafvN88mPOAstounding. While it's good news that the potential for President Trump to start a nuclear war has been reduced, there has been no progress toward verifiable North Korean denuclearization—no removals, no plan for inspections or even promise of inspections. https://t.co/Ne3OygLpmNThe father accepted deportation so that he could be with his child. But the child remains in government custody. Now for 4 months, the family video calls with their baby, detained by a foreign government.  https://t.co/SyzS6N98Z9There is no way around this: The United States government is violating human rights. @RAICEStexas, one of our community partners, reported that the Trump Admin tore a 4 month old child from their father’s arms &amp; held them in detention.If words, if speeches, if Trump’s tweets could resolve the drug pricing crisis, we would be celebrating a ‘yuge’ victory. But instead, Americans are left with sky-high prices that just keep soaring despite Trump’s many promises and declarations. https://t.co/vqf3Zuy6i3On Sunday I had the opportunity to hold a mini-town hall with 3 Sunday School classes—spanning multiple generations—at @fumcaustin. Our discussion included President Trump’s cruel immigration policies. Thanks to Revs. Kathleen Jones and Michael Mumme, &amp; all who participated. https://t.co/SitBgZvRSqPresident Trump treated the Prime Minister of our closest ally, Canada, with such contempt. His open disdain for democratic values &amp; his tendency to pick unseemly fights with our allies undermine the liberal international order. He does not represent a majority of Americans. https://t.co/jhmsn0p9kJToday, I spoke before the House floor on this Republican Congress’s lack of action in fighting our nation’s opioid crisis. You can watch my remarks here: https://t.co/9pcn6Rijcx https://t.co/QZ5FqqaNhCPleased to join the members of @NTEUnews Chapter 247 at their annual picnic at Fiesta Gardens. With President Trump leading attacks against federal labor unions, it is vital that we protect the rights of our hardworking federal employees like those in Chapter 247. https://t.co/V0FBaN4QwgIn the 2 yrs since the #Pulse massacre, there have been HUNDREDS of mass shootings, yet GOP has allowed ZERO votes on reasonable #gunsafety action. We must act to reduce gun violence, including universal background checks &amp; a ban on military-style assault weapons. https://t.co/gImjhGtDlsTalking is better than shooting. But Trump yielded much to a brutal tyrant for little more than the unverified promises we’ve been offered for years.Meanwhile, North Korea displayed to the world its flag beside ours and its cruel leader as an equal on the international stage, while achieving a reduction in U.S. military exercises and an effective easing of economic sanctions.What’s missing is even one of the essential steps to ensure verified North Korean denuclearization—no declarations of nuclear materials, sites, commitment to remove materials, no plan for inspections or even a promise of inspections.THREAD: Better handshakes with North Korean tyrant than guns blazing, missiles flying, and so many dying. Yet so far, Trump appears to have actually accomplished little more than the global attention he craves.Trump: A hawk on Canada, a dove on North Korea. And Republicans seeking reelection too chicken to speak out.The same day that Trump called for Russia to be reinstated as a member of the G-7, American intelligence director urged allies in France to combat Russia’s attempts to divide us. What a sharp, sad contrast between American values—&amp; Trumpian, Putin values.  https://t.co/GgxYkm228bThis wrongful action may well place the U.S. in violation of an international convention, but it undoubtedly stains the American conscience. So many vulnerable people will face gruesome deaths as a consequence of Trump-promoted anti-immigrant hysteria. https://t.co/aYTEymKX9PAttorney General Jeff Sessions has shamefully twisted the definition of asylum—this unilateral action will slam the door &amp; deport untold numbers of women and children.  Those fleeing life-threatening gang and domestic violence are being abruptly prohibited from obtaining asylum.Only 2 wks after Trump promised to lower Rx costs, Bayer celebrated his empty rhetoric by spiking the price on 2 already exorbitantly priced cancer drugs for the 2nd time in 6 months. It’s clear Big Pharma knows Trump will not reign in skyrocketing prices. https://t.co/0dMWUrl9zJI’m sponsoring a House resolution to restore #NetNeutrality—and will continue to fight for a free &amp; open internet. We can’t let the Trump Administration drag us backward.I support #netneutrality. While it is officially wiped out today, it is critical that @SpeakerRyan allow a vote on legislation to restore these important rules &amp; ensure consumers, small businesses, artists, &amp; start-ups have equal access to the Internet. https://t.co/pV96jKLhPKThe Republican staff who authored Trump’s tax scam didn’t wait long to reap their reward: well-paid lobbying gigs, for some of the same special interests that lapped up the lion’s share of the tax break bonanza. More alligators filling the Trump swamp. https://t.co/UIDVowq19wGovernor Abbott follows the Trump model on gun violence in our schools—just ignore the “gun” part of “gun violence” and study other aspects of the problem to death, indeed, to many unnecessary deaths.
https://t.co/04QInB2xZD55 years after #EqualPayAct we recognize the legal requirement of equal pay for equal work &amp; the need for more effective implementation. The gender wage gap persists at about 20% &amp; is much worse for Hispanic &amp; Black women. Let's recommit to achieving equality by closing that gap. https://t.co/oUmnCHc5tVJosé grips tightly to a drawing of his father &amp; at first refused to change out of the clothes he was wearing when he was last with his him. What lasting trauma on these little ones. It is un-American to punish children for the circumstances of their birth."He kept up a little wall,” a foster caregiver said about José, a 3-yr-old seized from his family. I am keeping in contact with separated families in our area &amp; am pursuing every legislative option to block this new policy of child abuse. This must end.

A fitting symbol for Trump. Could Putin have wished for more from his chosen candidate than the chaos &amp; distrust Trump is sowing w/ our allies while welcoming Putin? https://t.co/3YaJ5YZeMmSharing my recent remarks regarding my efforts opposing President Trump’s cruel policy to forcibly remove children from their asylum-seeking parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether
https://t.co/Ha4KJelYtRThe Supreme Court already upheld the Affordable Care Act as constitutional. Every single time, Trump and his Republican cohorts put politics over patients. If this succeeds, our most vulnerable neighbors would bear the burden.
https://t.co/DFXjZjYMR3In what may be the greatest attack on Americans’ health care yet, Trump’s Justice Department will no longer defend the law of the land and the American people from a dangerous and misguided lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general—led by Texas’ own AG Ken Paxton.The @SAHispanicCC's Making a Mark on the World Women’s Awards Luncheon celebrated dynamic women in our community. Congrats to all the deserving honorees. Your example will inspire more women to break through any glass ceilings that may hold them back. #WomensAwards18 https://t.co/T6wiWz0cFESharing my remarks at a recent #WearOrange @MomsDemand gun safety rally in San Antonio. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/qIMBRad7vkAll had been blocked or delayed for more than a year. The Trump Administration may be—illegally—weighting the scales of justice even further against immigrants. My joint statement with @RepCummings, Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee: https://t.co/9JWYtWsGgOFollowing our urging an investigation into illegal politicization of immigration judicial applicants, the Trump Administration has hastily appointed six of the judges in question.Gov. Abbott’s roundtable wasn’t very round—he excluded our leading advocates. And so his recommendations on "gun violence" in our schools largely omit the “gun” part. Real change demands open conversation &amp; courage to stand up to the NRA. #EnoughisEnough
https://t.co/oUlZWsx2VcJoined @AVANCEAustin's 20th Anniversary Celebration and Graduation Reception. Its Parent-Child Education Program offers early childhood and parenting education for families.

We must pass the DREAM Act and ensure extremists don't seize the open process to pass their “Bannon Bill." With this crack in the GOP immigration blockade, let’s pass the long-overdue action that our Dreamers deserve.The dream grows even closer: Almost all Democrats and more than 20 Republicans have joined the Dreamer discharge petition. From our area, hopefully Henry Cuellar will join us to make it 216. https://t.co/mZwQZBeSqXWe expect much from our teachers—to educate, nurture, lead, and protect our children, even in the midst of disasters. So how can our state leadership spend so little per pupil? It should be simple: Our children &amp; our teachers are great investments.
https://t.co/5PGYJKTR7OWe must recall history as it happened—not as re-written by authoritarian regimes &amp; dictators. As we remember Tiananmen Square this week, let’s honor those lost because they dared demand freedom &amp; recommit ourselves to protecting free expression everywhere.

This authoritarian thinking takes hold when GOP cowers &amp; refuses to push back against this naked power-grab.Trump’s presidency is a charade, where racism and intimidation are becoming almost routine, &amp; Trump pretends we can’t see behind the curtain. Demonization of those who are different cannot become the new normal.

https://t.co/s77Uqg2WJ5As our scientists at agencies like the EPA produce research showing the threats of climate change, the Trump Administration works a simple playbook: Either ignore or undercut their findings. But facts &amp; data that Trump doesn’t like are not “fake news.” 
https://t.co/IV893wMM81She is now in detention while Mateo was placed into foster care in San Antonio. Per her attorney, she “sits at Hutto [now], feeling powerless, waiting, worrying.” Seizing children into “foster care or whatever” takes a page straight out of the darkest chapters in history.I’m working to help one mother, “Luisa,” 23, who fled violence in Guatemala w/ her 5-yr-old son, “Mateo.” They climbed in raft on the Rio Grande about a month ago, coming to our border, asking for asylum. But Luisa was arrested &amp; Mateo was taken away. She hasn’t seen Mateo since.We gathered at Republic Square Park today because Trump is already building a wall—a wall to divide parents from their children. He wrongfully uses parents’ love for their children as a weapon. #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepFamiliesTogether 
https://t.co/uFOmBFOICTNOW: Rep.

But our state leadership has pledged their allegiance to the NRA. I want our allegiance to be to the safety of our schoolchildren. We need real work on background checks, military style assault weapons &amp; more. https://t.co/oDGbSbLVg0Trump’s pardons are all about protecting one person: Himself. He is broadcasting his willingness to exercise his pardon power for his cohorts, who face incarceration for criminal acts and who could make some unpleasant disclosures about Trump.@MomsDemand @AMarch4OurLives We need reasonable gun safety legislation to keep weapons of war out of our communities and to prevent dangerous individuals from accessing firearms.Governor’s refusal to meet w/ @MomsDemand &amp; @AMarch4OurLives produced a collection of narrow proposals, which fail to offer a comprehensive plan to strength school safety. Largely ignored is the “gun” part of gun violence.I will speaking out against the Trump Administration’s cruel child separation policy on Friday, June 1 at Republic Square Park in Austin around 4:30 p.m. https://t.co/IH93Oys7SJWhat an abdication of leadership: An estimated 4,645 people died in Hurricane Maria &amp; its aftermath in Puerto Rico, a figure that dwarfs Puerto Rico's official death toll of 64. https://t.co/GspMtQ2vc3Congratulations to @hdrewgalloway, and the MOVE team on five years of mobilizing, organizing, voting, and empowering a new generation of engaged citizens.

In a new level of success, Trump has attacked our Nation’s top law enforcement agency, the FBI, as the “Criminal Deep State.”As evidence mounts on role of Big Pharma in downplaying risk of opioids, Texas is right to pursue repayment from pharma for taxpayer $ spent addressing crisis.

What’s your fav park? #FindYourPark https://t.co/t98aXVHTYtAfter adding more than $2 trillion to the deficit with their #GOPTaxScam, the GOP and the #TrumpBudget want to cut billions from student assistance programs, making college less affordable leaving more students with debt. #StandwithStudents #SaveStudentAid https://t.co/VPuRrSBdewIf you were wondering who has reason to celebrate the giant Trump Republican tax windfall law, look no further than Wall Street. In three months, six banks save $3.6 billion, thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. In all, $2+ trillion will be added to our nat'l debt.
https://t.co/ubHuK2eXhiThe return ride to Govalle involves plenty of coasting, but no coasting in DC this week—it’s back to persisting against Trump w/ a forum on pharma price gouging, subcommittee mtgs on trade &amp; workforce development, &amp; in between, a Latino/a arts gathering &amp; visits from many Texans.From the Eastside hills, downtown Austin is visible in the distance. Years ago, I obtained federal funding to build what is still the only major trail in Southeast Austin. The thick, bright greenery along this urban trail offers a feeling of being in the country. https://t.co/eYwhoh5wqbWe cycled the Southern Walnut Creek Trail, which is particularly great at this time of year. For those of us who enjoy San Antonio cycling, this trail bears more similarities to Salado Creek, which Commissioner Tommy Calvert is seeking to enhance, than Mission Reach. https://t.co/1RdjheAyG2Lisa suffers from the uncertainty of Multiple Sclerosis but which is fortunately controlled for now with infusions. She has dogged determination and is pretty amazing. You can read more about her story and journey here: https://t.co/iQSyKUXIsqEarly morning workout today w/ our daughter Dr. @LisaDoggettMD, who is preparing for the #MS150 bike ride w/ Team Tacodeli from Houston to Austin next weekend. Training w/ her is mainly trying to keep up for 21 miles after which I stopped, &amp; she continued to double that distance. https://t.co/miD8Mpp0grI have participated in town halls on gun safety that have included many impressive students in both San Antonio and Austin. Their persistence and participation—not just protests and marches—can ultimately produce change next year.
https://t.co/VpJzUbAFzxFour more people killed today in Tennessee by a 20-year-old with an assault rifle. More and more will fall victim to this madness until we respond to the well justified demands of courageous student leaders and overcome Republican opposition to #gunsafety legislation.On #EarthDay and every day, let’s cherish our planet’s beauty and work together to preserve our God-given natural wonders. There is still much work to do to protect our environment and mitigate climate change. The oceans may be rising but so must we! https://t.co/wxSayXUX0fBegan Fiesta with many medals and many good friends. Together with Sen. Leticia Van De Putte, Mayor Ron Nirenberg and Erika Prosper, Janie Barrera, Luisa Casso, and Cruz and Olivia Ortiz. ¡Viva Fiesta! https://t.co/KfpU0YzEdXI introduced the Special Counsel Transparency Act to ensure Trump cannot insulate himself from accountability and seize &amp; secret evidence of misconduct already gathered. It is critical that we pass this measure and the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act.Respected former @TheJusticeDept employees called on Congress to prevent Trump from meddling in the Special Counsel’s investigation into Russian interference &amp; possible collusion. I stand with these bipartisan public servants in defending our Constitution. https://t.co/LofCCMVlAiStanding with so many students, parents and their allies, we called for action now on  gun safety legislation.  The eloquent passion of Olivia Hoffman, Bayley Stewart and the other organizers and speakers today, is an inspiration to us all. https://t.co/xJyikpqfDOIncredibly moving day seeing the momentum of Texas students seeking peace and calling for reasonable gun safety measures. Take a look at a few powerful moments.  
https://t.co/DvAyuTy4jzOn the anniversary of Columbine, I am both reflective &amp; inspired by the thousands of students across the country who are renewing their calls for gun safety measures. Looking forward to hearing from TX students &amp; hearing their stories and ideas.Senate GOP voted to cut important @CFPB policy that helped prevent discrimination &amp; predatory auto lending, again handcuffing the cop on Wall St. Consumers shouldn’t be charged higher interest bc of their race. https://t.co/ZnUX5EuhS6I was saddened to hear about the passing of Erin Popovich. My thoughts are with Gregg Popovich and his family, and I hope they find comfort in the love and support of the entire San Antonio community, for whom Coach Pop has contributed so much.We successfully secured World Heritage status for our Missions despite US nonpayment of UNESCO dues. Now Trump is withdrawing our country entirely from UNESCO, meaning no voice for America when our World Heritage status is reviewed. https://t.co/SPWIJNvweTIn a W&amp;M mtg I commend #VITA for providing free tax assistance to those in need. Orgs like @UnitedWaySA @CathCharitiesSA
@foundcom have helped countless filers secure the money they’ve earned &amp; I support codifying VITA to encourage local voluntary efforts https://t.co/g4A0iNcCrEIt's reckless for @SenateMajLdr McConnell to block a vote on a bipartisan bill to check Trump, protecting Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling &amp; possible collusion.The only person Trump won’t fire is Putin. https://t.co/oiXSdTZMEQ@JoaquinCastrotx @RepCummings @RepDonBeyer Our courts should not be wielded as tools to further slam the door on the American Dream. Not satisfied with building a costly and unnecessary wall at the border, Trump is already building one at the courthouse. @ExpressNews https://t.co/UFrtrbNMZp@JoaquinCastrotx @RepCummings @RepDonBeyer Massive backlogs in immigration hearings are not being addressed in a way to achieve justice but with crackdowns on asylum-seekers, cuts to immigrant legal assistance, quotas for judges, separating children from parents, even terminating the San Antonio immigration help desk.That is why I, along with @JoaquinCastrotx @RepCummings @RepDonBeyer have questioned AG Jeff Sessions about whistleblower allegations that the DOJ may be using ideological &amp; political considerations to illegally block the hiring of immigration judges. https://t.co/TPPhCsAKNjThe Trump Administration seems determined to do everything possible—even impairing the integrity of the judiciary—to weight the scales of justice against immigrants. https://t.co/UFrtrbNMZpElegant, intelligent, and patriotic, Barbara Bush served our country, and she was dedicated to improving literacy and education across the country. My deepest condolences to the family and many friends and admirers of our former First Lady.My No Tax Breaks for Outsourcing Act would end discrimination against companies w mostly domestic sales by not advantaging multinationals with large tax breaks on profits earned abroad. Davila Pharmacy should not have to pay a higher tax rate than Pfizer on its US operations.For #TaxDay, I spoke at a Capitol rally on how the #GOPTaxScam instead explodes our debt &amp; rewards those at the top. Rather than lavishing tax breaks on the wealthiest few and saddling our grandchildren with debt, I believe that to grow our economy, we need to invest in people. https://t.co/XUR21SwyA9Because of the #GOPTaxScam, 13 million more Americans will be uninsured. We need to protect Medicare and Medicaid, invest in educational opportunity, rebuild roads and bridges, and pass comprehensive immigration reform, not scam hardworking Americans. https://t.co/oLm0DvUQtzAs I will be saying at a Capitol rally shortly, #TaxDay is really a GOP #TaxScam. Disguised as tax relief for working families, their bill actually provides 83 percent of the tax cuts to the top one percent of Americans by the end of the decade, only widening income inequality.This #TaxDay, who benefits from the Republican #TaxScam? A who’s who of not you. @LaPrensa_News
https://t.co/MHk5UzOZyf@RepRaskin @RepTedLieu @davidcicilline Thank you to @POGOBlog @OpentheGov @SunFoundation @CREWcrew for endorsing this bill. You can read more here: https://t.co/zDcSliLxYz@RepRaskin @RepTedLieu @davidcicilline The Special Counsel Transparency Act would ensure that a President, who has shown so little respect for the rule of law, cannot seize and secret any evidence of misconduct already gathered by law enforcement.@RepRaskin @RepTedLieu @davidcicilline As Trump tries to insulate himself from accountability, we must ensure that the #SpecialCounsel’s work is not buried and our democracy is not destroyed.Amid Trump’s ongoing baseless attacks on Special Counsel Mueller, we move closer to a crisis that will impact the country. That is why I w/ @RepRaskin @RepTedLieu @DavidCicilline intro'd a bill to preserve the work of Mueller’s investigation in the event that Trump fires him.Last two Nat’l Guard ops on border cost a whopping $1.3 billion. As @RepRubenGallego noted, cost of assisting in 2 arrests (they can’t actually arrest) could provide a year of homeless veteran housing. https://t.co/jrvb3YUgA2Met with @DanielEllsberg and discussed his new book, Doomsday Machine, which chronicles what he learned as a defense analyst—&amp; how we can dismantle the “Doomsday Machine” to prevent a nuclear holocaust. https://t.co/0RGUN27It0We must reject the false comparison btwn democracy-assistance groups like @NDI &amp; Russian ops. “While democracy-assistance organizations help partners strengthen their capacity for self-determination," Kremlin launches campaigns to subvert open societies. https://t.co/tixAwfz3leThe @ScienceMarchSA—sending a message: we believe in science, not mythology. We don’t need alternative facts, we need alternative energy. We must advance science-guided public policy. Our local leaders push for sustainability; I will keep advancing these values in Congress. https://t.co/CZD9SEwzXXDisregarding Panama's separation of powers, Trump Organization lawyers are pressuring the Panamanian President for help w/ a business dispute that is currently before the courts. Again, Trump is unable to separate his personal affairs from his public life. https://t.co/BiuVRRl84XAt the Turkish Festival I joined Beytullah Colak, Mehmet Oguz, &amp; other friends at the Alamo to celebrate rich cultural diversity &amp; Turkish-American community. Tragedy continues in Turkey w/ tyranny of Erdogan who has imprisoned so many &amp; jeopardizes the future of a great country. https://t.co/ulrldypbyOOn the Southside, Brooks is about jobs &amp; new businesses, hotels, a hospital, a medical school, &amp; history of a fully restored Hanger 9. But the Greenline trail shows @LiveBrooksTX is also about the joy of life—space for neighbors to connect, families to gather, &amp; children to play. https://t.co/tGsClQcpBCAnd learning from this history, we must do more to stop ethnic cleansing wherever it occurs and against whomever it is directed any place in the world. 
https://t.co/lFwGlnSX9PIn personal visits to Auschwitz &amp; other death camps &amp; painful, powerful testimonies of survivors, I've encountered evidence of incredible inhumanity.

Scooter Libby pardon brazenly signals Trump plans for more pardons for his inner circle.   https://t.co/glBTc57RjoInstead of condemning actual attack on US democracy by Putin, he congratulates him on sham election. Trump is a dangerous authoritarian wannabe. If he interferes w/ Mueller’s investigation of collusion &amp; Russian interference, we must respond forcefully. https://t.co/2PDKXJg4JVFor Trump, Congressmembers, who don’t clap enough for him, are guilty of treason. Now his Deputy Att'y Gen'l, who approved a search warrant in an apparent investigation of yet another member of Trump inner circle, is engaged in “an attack on America.”Our communities continue to see the effects of a President who doesn’t value a strong safety net. Trump’s new “Reducing Poverty in America” should be called “Reducing Public Aid to Americans who Need it Most.” https://t.co/ZP86DAYTedOur Nation cannot turn our back on Christian &amp; other refugees who bravely fled oppression. I am working with other Members to ensure they’re not returned to land where they would be persecuted. https://t.co/NfNgqsuRBqLike some stormy sermon from Trump on the virtues of chastity, House GOP today deserves a gold medal for hypocrisy. After adding trillions to the debt w tax breaks for those at the very top, they audaciously advance a “balanced” budget amdt. #DeedsNotWords https://t.co/bUMvtkAqEqAnother Trump Admin low—abrupt termination of the good work in our area by @amergateways &amp; even eliminating the sole help desk at the San Antonio Immigration Court. Weighting the scales of justice further against immigrants to keep them in the dark. https://t.co/MIYcNERP6oThe #NRA stands for #NoRepublicanAction. I heard this sentiment from TX students, who organized events to share their ideas &amp; concerns on the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/QzDmCeG0vDThe W&amp;M Committee approved legislation including parts of my bill to strengthen taxpayer rights &amp; protect privacy. While I welcome these modest changes, GOP still refuses to hold hearings on the tax breaks they enacted to benefit the few. https://t.co/eze185YeEUSpeaker Paul Ryan, long mute in the face of increasingly erratic and dangerous Trump behavior, should now find his voice and allow a vote to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller from being fired.Dripping in red ink, Trump’s #taxplan certainly validates his boast that he is “the King of Debt.” Our children and grandchildren will be saddled w/ nearly $2 trillion over a decade in more debt so that Trump &amp; the wealthiest few receive huge #taxbreaks. https://t.co/w0Why14UYEProductive meeting with San Antonio @MomsDemand. Thank you Becca DeFelice, Danna Halff, Sandra Sutton, and many others for your local efforts to promote gun sense and safety in our community during this very challenging time for our nation. https://t.co/kG84lT2yum79 cents.

It’s time to close the #wagegap. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/iTsriVWhUbApril 10 is #EqualPayDay, which represents how far into 2018 women would have to work to earn what men did in 2017. That needs to change! Time to close the #wagegap. https://t.co/Uamg5pO016Like a Trump sermon on the virtues of chastity, House GOP achieves new hypocritical heights. After approving budget-busting, trickle-down tax breaks &amp; refusing to pay for their military spending increase, they schedule a vote on the balanced budget amdt. https://t.co/f34pq2NdShWhile others may have avoided an opportunity to engage with the inspirational &amp; resilient high school students demanding change &amp; action on #gunviolence, I sought to listen to their ideas &amp; stories. @KVUE https://t.co/7kCCrGKhwlBeautiful work by MujerArtes on display at this year’s Paseo Por El Westside.

Russia’s attacks &amp; subversion of democracy don’t deserve a White House photo op. https://t.co/yL3jo0ZK8xBecause Trump is a loser—a loser on his worthless wall, a loser on his bigotry, and now a loser with our tax money on this latest venture.And we know that despite Trump’s oft repeated promise, this won’t be paid for in pesos, but rather in hard-earned American tax dollars. Why more waste?Diverting the National Guard to the Mexican border—the Guard will not be apprehending anyone, apparently only providing backup services &amp; creating a militarized appearance. Over a billion dollars was wasted on largely ineffective use of the Guard for the same purpose previously.Honored the important work of @WorkersDefense w/ ED Jose Garza &amp; EVP Tefere Gebre. Addressing construction worker safety, immigrant rights &amp; empowering families w new opps &amp; workforce training, Workers Defense reinforces our shared vision of TX–one of inclusion, equity &amp; justice. https://t.co/TPK6JscXMYKudos to @JuanCastilloAAS for his editorial calling out Trump's false DACA tirade. Ignorant, misleading, deliberately inflammatory. Instead of leading, Trump continues to mislead on immigration. https://t.co/5qQJ2nubmyHis words offer guidance: “Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination. And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be. We have an opportunity to make America a better nation.”Today, we reflect &amp; commemorate the contributions &amp; legacy of a courageous &amp; inspirational man – Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose life was taken 50 years ago. Let’s honor him by recommitting ourselves to continue promoting his Dream of a more inclusive &amp; peaceful Nation. #MLK50 https://t.co/vvZtg5kJyVIgnoring the law, the cost to taxpayers, and umpteen campaign promises, Trump’s effort to militarize our border is just another of his bad border ideas. Neither a parade in Washington glorifying him nor parading on the border are tasks to which our military should be diverted.Trump continues his damaging Hug-a-Thug, Love-a-Tyrant foreign policy. He seems to envy these authoritarians, who destroy the press &amp; individual freedoms while imprisoning their opponents. We either resist now or lose democracy later.
