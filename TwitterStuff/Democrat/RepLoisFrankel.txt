I'm going LIVE on my Facebook to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy &amp; defending women's rights! https://t.co/dHU0GLe60pMy heart goes out to Rob’s family,friends&amp;colleagues. Yesterday’s attack on local journalists, who play a crucial role in our communities, was another horrific instance of #gunviolence in our nation. When will we say #EnoughIsEnough &amp; act? #CapitalGazette 
https://t.co/eApP6GAye3When I heard about Justice Kennedy's retirement, alarm bells went off. Trump has pledged to appoint a justice who would repeal #RoevWade. We can’t let that happen, so my message to all of you: Don't give up -  FIGHT BACK! https://t.co/nnsqogzsWGChilling. No one should have to go through such a terrifying experience. My thoughts are with the staff of the Capital Gazette, their families, and all those affected by this horrible attack. I will continue to monitor this developing situation. https://t.co/nEd3y7wsHxI agree, that is ridiculous. Thanks for speaking out, @RepSeanMaloney! https://t.co/QeqCupvsZ3Let’s encourage women to pull up a chair and take a seat at the table. Our world will be safer if they’re able to raise their voices!Specifically, it would:
1. Integrate gender perspectives into our military missions
2. Assist countries in incorporating women into their security efforts
3. Fund research on women's contributions to security efforts @DeptofDefenseWhen given a seat at the table, women are agents of change, especially when it comes to peace &amp; security negotiations. Proud that my amendment w/@USRepKeating passed today – it will build on the Women, Peace &amp; Security Act &amp; help amplify women's voices in global peace building.This is shameful! Expecting toddlers to represent themselves in court is ridiculous &amp; will add to the unnecessary trauma they've suffered. Reuniting these kids with their parents&amp;providing legal counsel is paramount–we must act now. #FamiliesBelongTogether
https://t.co/6z55fxWvUVHis retirement gives an opportunity for @POTUS and Republicans to appoint another jurist that takes us backwards on women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, civil rights, workers’ rights and health care for generations to come. https://t.co/WYgILXokYpI thank Justice Kennedy for his years of service to our country. Although I have disagreed with many of his positions, I am grateful that he was on the majority side on historic decisions protecting access to legal abortion &amp; advancing human rights.While extremists pursue their relentless anti-abortion hysteria, we must continue to #ActForWomen &amp; support the Women's Health Protection Act!#OTD two years ago, #SCOTUS ruled in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt and upheld our constitutionally guaranteed rights to abortion.Today’s #SCOTUS decision is a heavy blow to millions of teachers, firefighters, &amp; working Americans. I’ll continue to stand with unions &amp; support the right to organize to fight for better wages &amp; rights. #UnionStrong #Janus https://t.co/2KJhbb1CZBNo one should be denied health care coverage because of a pre-existing condition, or be forced to pay and arm and a leg for care – yet this is the reality Republicans want to take us back to. I was proud to stand with my Democratic colleagues to say that we must #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/Hdg4Ccb00qToday #SCOTUS decided it's okay to let fake health centers LIE to women about their medical care. This Administration, including Justice Gorsuch, will stop at nothing to take us back to the days of coat-hanger medicine, but we will NOT go back! #EndtheLies #NIFLAvBecerra https://t.co/VAR9g6iIgl3 yrs ago today we celebrated the historic #SCOTUS marriage equality ruling that declared #LoveisLove! I'll always stand w/the #LGBTQ community as we continue working to ensure all Americans, no matter who they love, have basic protections from discrimination #EqualityForward https://t.co/1pp5yrGK6UThe @FCC repealed #NetNeutrality, but the fight for a free &amp; open internet continues. The Senate has already voted to #SaveTheInternet – I’m proud to support similar legislation here in the House! https://t.co/Zsqmo2BKgZThe #SCOTUS ruling gives @realDonaldTrump the green light for his dangerous, shameful policy that will make us less safe. This ban feeds into fear &amp; hatred while turning away from our deeply held American values of diversity &amp; freedom of religion. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/SNDEhWLaE9In 10 minutes, my colleagues and I will hold a press conference to discuss our experiences this past weekend at the Texas border. Tune in here: https://t.co/9ob74f1V2N #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepFamiliesTogetherI’ll never forget what I heard and saw this weekend in Texas - all because of Trump's zero-tolerance policy that took children away from their parents. We are fighting for the soul of our country. Keep your voices loud. #KeepFamilesTogether 
https://t.co/ZcyvZhZKDGOur democracy only works when elections are free &amp; fair, and all eligible voters are able to cast a ballot. On the anniversary of Shelby County v. Holder, it's time to #RestoreTheVOTE and push for a stronger democracy by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act! https://t.co/f69DmGgpA8Mr. President, unlike you, I've been to these facilities since your cruel policy was instated. I saw a sea of humanity - countless mothers who came to America fleeing violence in search of a better life for their children. They deserve due process &amp; their day in court. https://t.co/Oo95YcTBTROver the weekend, #TitleIX turned 46! I remain firmly committed to protecting equal opportunity for women and girls so they can participate and achieve in education free from discrimination, harassment and violence. #ProtectTitleIXWhat I saw today was absolutely horrifying. I will never forget the sobs I heard from so many mothers who had been ripped apart from their babies. This is no way to solve our issues at the border. Trump caused this problem, and he MUST put forth a plan to reunite these families. https://t.co/Y3ziGgOGHuI am horrified by what I have seen in this detention center. It is un-American to secure the border by separating mothers and fathers from their children. We have to reunite these families and do better to give them a humane living situation. What's happening is unacceptable.They are not being updated on the news, and many of the detainees didn't even know about the new Executive Order. They are fed misinformation -- encouraged to fill out paperwork and led to believe they might then be reunited with their kids.Women were dressed in blue jumpers, men in orange. Basically treated as criminals. One woman said she’s been in that same clothing for two weeks.Other detainees were deported without their kids. Many at the facility are terrified that will happen to them.One woman had her child taken on June 6. She was told it would just be for 48 hours because she was going to court. Then her child was gone. Since then she has only spoken to daughter once and doesn’t know where she is.We met with 20-30 women who were in hysterics &amp; don't know where their kids are. Some had been there for over a month &amp; haven’t had the option to see a lawyer.Just toured Port Isabel ICE Detention Center in TX. It was horrifying, shocking &amp; very eye-opening. Thread to follow....My concerns about the humanitarian crisis at the border have not been alleviated. Read more about our trip here ⬇️

https://t.co/mCBeNmFYLvAlso saw many who slept in a cell with concrete floor under mylar blanket. Shoes still caked with mud. Doors of cells had signs with identifying characteristics like “male juvi 13 under”From what I’ve seen so far at the #Texas border, there are a lot of young girls and their mothers packed into cement cell blocks. They don’t look like criminals to me, but they are definitely fleeing from criminals in their home countries.On our way to Port Isabel ICE facility in a bus previously used to transport detainees. Will be meeting more parents who’ve been separated from their kids. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/to0C12GyToJust toured the “Ursula” processing center in McAllen, TX. So many young people and parents. I saw humanity - not violent gang members. But still haven’t heard any plan to reunite the 2,300+ children who’ve been separated from their parents. https://t.co/CEO1PWtK6sI'm on my way to McAllen &amp; Brownsville, TX to see the impact of @realDonaldTrump's #ZeroTolerance policy. Joining 20+ of my colleagues tomorrow to tour processing &amp; detention facilities. Stay tuned for more updates! #FamiliesBelongTogetherFinally some good news! Now only 2,300+ kids left to go....
#FamiliesBelongTogether
https://t.co/9krJxpFf3PJoining my colleagues to hear from experts on Trump’s #ZeroTolerance policy. Tune in! #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/7BqmB5CgBTCheryl from #PBC was born w/ a heart defect. After years of being denied coverage, the #ACA made it possible for her to get care. Now, @POTUS &amp; the GOP want to take it away! For Cheryl&amp;the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions, I'll keep fighting to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/kqJPLanvnkInstead of pushing back on the cruel separation of families at our border, @HouseGOP are presenting anti-family, anti-immigrant &amp; anti-American legislation. As the granddaughter of immigrants, I can’t stand by and watch this happen - I’m voting NO! https://t.co/vI9BP4Hz5fThe Trump Admin has been disturbingly silent on the whereabouts and treatment of migrant girls separated from their families. What are they hiding? #WhereAreTheGirls https://t.co/TosD8KYff8While Congress votes on 2 horrible, anti-family immigration bills, over 2,300 kids are still missing their parents, not knowing if they will ever see them again. We must take action to bring these families back together&amp;stop the cruel zero-tolerance policy! #KeepFamiliesTogetherPresident Trump’s action to undo a horribly cruel crisis that he created is a publicity stunt aimed at keeping migrant families detained indefinitely in abominable prison-like conditions. Congress must act to override this zero tolerance government inflicted child abuse.@SecNielsen, where are the girls? Why hasn’t anyone been able to report on their condition? Your secrecy &amp; cruelty must STOP. #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/ZpLtScH0OKNo nos quedaremos silenciosos hasta que el fin de esta política cruel e inhumana. @realDonaldTrump tiene la fuerza que de levantar el teléfono y terminar con esto de una vez por todas. #FamiliasUnidas 
https://t.co/vAIJiiCdy0The @HouseGOP’s #BrighterForBillionaires budget:
- Protects #GOPTaxScam giveaways to the wealthy 💰
- Cuts Medicare, Medicaid, #SNAP, education, transportation, &amp; investments in economic growth ✂️ https://t.co/hT2zwpoQTJRepublicans made big promises as part of their #GOPTaxScam– and 6 months later, it’s still failing to live up to the hype &amp; failing middle-class families who deserve #ABetterDeal.
https://t.co/zFKw9IEIqmI stand firm in my commitment to the health &amp; safety of refugees on #WorldRefugeeDay. Instead of abandoning the world's most vulnerable, @realDonaldTrump should restore funding to @UNFPA to help women &amp; girls seeking refuge &amp; care around the world!
https://t.co/vocKaORWLZShame on Republicans for yet again attacking the health care of American families. Having a pre-existing condition shouldn’t prevent you from getting the life-saving care you need. Democrats will continue to fight to #ProtectOurCare! https://t.co/6ELYwAtOr8This #GOPBudget would be a disaster &amp; a raw deal for millions of Americans who rely on these programs. Democrats will keep fighting for #ABetterDeal to strengthen and protect Medicare &amp; Social Security. https://t.co/DbCnfOTQGpLast year, the @HouseGOP voted to rip protections away from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. Now, the Trump DOJ is trying to finish what they started. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/xUErcpaQOkElsa and her son came to the US seeking asylum from gang violence in Guatemala. Instead she was deported while her son was taken away to a shelter. They may never be reunited. This policy is evil, heart-breaking and un-American. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/7E1IQV0OCOWe will NOT be quiet until this cruel, inhumane policy ENDS! @realDonaldTrump has the power to pick up the phone and end this once and for all. Do it. #KeepFamiliesTogether 
https://t.co/z24D4JtjVqThank you, Laura Bush, for speaking out. This horrendous policy MUST end. This is not who we are as Americans. #EndFamilySeparation #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/EoxutfnRqKMr. Trump, I know you don’t like facts but here’s one for you. Family separation happening at the border today is solely directed by YOUR Attorney General &amp; YOUR administration. Shame on you! YOU have the ability to end it immediately. Do it! https://t.co/EMeGG0PVtJWe've seen a lot of ruthless actions from the Trump Administration, but this zero tolerance policy is as bad as it gets. Separating children from their parents is cruel, inhumane and goes everything we stand for as a country. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Non3jtmitBMillions of Americans with pre-existing conditions don’t want to go back to when they could be discriminated against by insurers &amp; blocked from getting health coverage. Trump's admin &amp; Congressional Republicans want to take us backwards. 
https://t.co/7HjtAdRkXgThanks @theNASciences for this important report. From lewd comments to outright assault, sexual harassment is rampant in STEM &amp; every field. Pleased to see the report offers concrete steps on how to change culture &amp; foster safer workplaces. #MeToo #TimesUp https://t.co/LbCDm8qwm3Always good to see our great friends from @CanCGMiami in DC! @CGMiamiHarper and I discussed the enduring partnership between our two nations. From tourism to trade, Canadians and South Floridians have a beautiful friendship -- one that will continue &amp; stay strong! https://t.co/1q9eJFApgtThe effects of #climatechange are a real &amp; serious threat for #SFL. We need to act now to save our coastlines, before it’s too late. https://t.co/lFtSPLFfyQWearing a purple ribbon today to reject Trump’s cruel decision to block asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence, most of whom are women &amp; children. Seeking refuge is a human right that we must uphold! https://t.co/NJK9c4paI8Too many families are struggling to afford child care during the summer school break. I urge my colleagues to support the Child Care for Working Families Act, which would help working parents get their kids high-quality, safe #summercare!Over 130 MILLION Americans living with pre-existing conditions are able to get health coverage thanks to the #ACA, including 7,810,000+ Floridians. We need to #ProtectOurCare, not strip people of their right to health care like Republicans keep trying to do. https://t.co/stbjDRDImWThis “blacklist” is nothing more than a political move undermining our diplomats. Gutting the State Dept jeopardizes our national security &amp; pushes out talented civil servants at a time when we desperately need their experience. https://t.co/TxBimYi3UjProud to stand with @rosadelauro &amp; my colleagues to condemn Trump's zero tolerance policy that is ripping kids away from their mothers and fathers. It's government inflicted child abuse -- it's cruel, inhumane and it must stop! #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/yWBNbQruoNJoined @WPBF25News to discuss the #NorthKoreaSummit. @realDonaldTrump has got it all mixed up – he alienates our allies like Canada, while heaping praise on dictators, like Kim Jong-un, who oppress their own people. https://t.co/DJg8mUOehyIn exchange, Kim Jong-un offered a vague promise instead of concrete timetables &amp; a commitment to verifiable denuclearization. Congress must watch this carefully. #NorthKoreaSummitDiplomacy is welcome but what we got was another hyped-up episode of a bad reality show. @POTUS gave #NorthKorea a major U.S. concession - suspension of defensive military drills with South Korea. https://t.co/oFSvgumPdaTwo years later, our hearts continue to ache for our neighbors in Orlando &amp; the 49 lives lost at #Pulse. We will never forget them &amp; will continue to stand with the #LGBTQ community against hate. #DisarmHate https://t.co/KmMoB4PodYAnother cruel and un-American decision by the Trump Administration. This will impact so many women and families fleeing violence in search of a better, safer life. Sessions and Trump should be ashamed of themselves!

My third amendment in #NDAA reaffirms that continued U.S. leadership in @NATO is critical to our national securityWith that being said, the full range of women’s roles as victims, supporters, and preventers of terrorism is often overlooked. My second provision included in #NDAA would require U.S. strategy on countering violent extremism to account for women's roles.The world is stronger &amp; more prosperous when women participate in conflict prevention and peace negotiations. That's why I'm pleased my amendment was included in #NDAA that authorizes @DeptofDefense to conduct research on women’s contributions to security around the world.Flight attendants are responsible for our safety and comfort when traveling the skies.

A good start would be nominating an Ambassador to South Korea.I hope the President learned that you cannot run the country &amp; diplomacy like a reality show. You have to prepare, talk to experts with all different points of view, and come to the table with specific goals in mind.Walking away from the negotiating table is a mistake, taking us many steps backwards.

This decision has the potential to destabilize the region, isolate us from our Euro allies&amp;undermine American credibility around the world.More than 80% of nutrition assistance goes to households that include a child, a senior, or person with a disability – and they’re going to be hit hardest by the GOP Farm Bill. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/UlkjREYyTDThe Trump administration continues to push their cruel immigration policies.

The spending bill includes reimbursement for overtime hours spent protecting the President when he visits Mar-a-Lago in #PBC.The bipartisan Women’s Caucus is determined to help change this toxic workplace culture - so every worker, from waitresses to bartenders, to flight attendants, can earn their livelihoods w/o being subject to this abusive behavior. #TimesUp #MeTooThanks, @emmawebsta @Allure_magazine for the Q&amp;A. Sexual harassment isn't about sex - it's about power over others and depriving them of being able to take care of their families.
https://t.co/lGLMiESNxwOn average, 90 Americans a day are killed with guns. That means more than 33,000 grieving, heartbroken families a year who lose a child, a parent, a sibling. #EnoughIsEnough – we must #EndGunViolence https://t.co/WFpAI12oCJI applaud @Starbucks for achieving gender &amp; racial pay equity in the US. It's a good step forward - everyone deserves #equalpay for equal work! Now Congress should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, so workers can reach their full economic potential &amp; families can thrive https://t.co/4tJBMdoaNOHere we go again - America is looking at another budget deadline. It’s time for the @HouseGOP to put an end to their obsession with short-term stop-gap spending bills! It’s irresponsible and no way to run a government #DoYourJob.@CecileRichards, your commitment to women's reproductive freedom &amp; access to health care services has improved the lives of so many women! Thank you for your hard work, dedication, &amp; leadership @PPFA over the past 12 years. #StandwithPP https://t.co/s6HMohfBc6Every student deserves a learning environment free from discrimination &amp; harassment. Let’s pass the Student Non-Discrimination Act to protect ALL students &amp; say that hate has no place in our classrooms. #LetKidsLearn https://t.co/hTbGZxsE70Small businesses are the backbone to our economy, especially in #Florida - since 2011, they've had a $19.2 billion GDP impact on Florida's economy and there are 252,955 #smallbiz jobs that were created, retained&amp;saved thanks to the @FloridaSBDCN! #SBDCDayThat's why @RepMarkTakano &amp; I, along w/ 69 Democratic Members of Congress, called for an increase in @USEEOC's funding, so they can properly handle cases &amp; ensure workplaces are safe &amp; dignified. Read the full letter &gt;&gt;https://t.co/TNtgG5TtjLIn the age of #MeToo, more workers are coming forward with harrowing stories of sexual harassment, yet the @USEEOC does not have sufficient resources to shoulder increased demand for its services. Workplace discrimination cases are too important to be put on hold! https://t.co/mWbqg9f32j#6MonthsAfterMaria, tens of thousands of Americans are still without permanent shelter, water or electricity. With hurricane season fast approaching, the federal government should be funding #PuertoRico’s recovery &amp; investing in its future. https://t.co/p4JL35pUnGThanks @jacksontkatz for joining our hearing. Your perspective on engaging men is invaluable in this discussion. To fully take on sexual harassment in the workplace, men MUST be a part of the equation. No one benefits from toxic workplaces &amp; we must all be a part of the solution!Thank you, Patricia Wise, for sharing your expertise at our hearing on sexual harassment in the service sector. I agree, anti-harassment training should be engaging, rather than just checking a box. I'm interested to hear more about how workplaces can accomplish this #MeTooSome very important points raised by Victoria Lipnic, Acting Chair of @USEEOC: sexual harassment is a persistent problem that is often unreported. We need anti-harassment policies in place that start at the top with real leadership &amp; accountability.Heard at our bipartisan hearing: "Sexual harassment is not about sex; it is about power." -- I couldn't agree with you more, @FlyingWithSara. Glad you're here fighting for flight attendants to create better workplaces. https://t.co/eqVZO0CgJVThank you Marie &amp; Roushaunda for bravely sharing your stories at our bipartisan hearing on sexual harassment. I hope we will keep discussing ways to end this cycle of abuse so that we have safe &amp; dignified workplaces for all! #MeToo #TimesUpHappening now: a bipartisan Women's Caucus hearing about combating sexual harassment in the service sector. Watch live! https://t.co/BC8rneccYwWhen women make history, America moves forward. Congratulations @RepMarcyKaptur on becoming the longest-serving woman in House history. #WomenMakeHistory https://t.co/Xu6O28zs1QBecause women and men in every workplace should be able to work side by side in safety and dignity. Join us LIVE at 2:00PM! 
https://t.co/dHU0GLe60pSo that’s why today, the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues will shine a light on the issue by hosting a hearing today on combating sexual harassment in the service sector. https://t.co/iOBuAbMuZtWhile #MeToo headlines are usually dominated by famous men like Harvey Weinstein &amp; Matt Lauer, sexual harassment runs rampant across all industries, especially in service sector jobs..@louiseslaughter’s no-nonsense ferocity in protecting women’s reproductive health and our American values has inspired me and countless others. She was a fierce leader and a role model to all, and will be sorely missed. https://t.co/XrZHTGs8GP https://t.co/bUwnFLrZtGHeartbroken &amp; shocked to hear about the passing of my dear friend Louise Slaughter. She was a trailblazer who dedicated her life to fighting for women and families. My thoughts are with her children and grandchildren.Happy 85th birthday, #SCOTUS Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg! You are a true trailblazer and an inspiration to women around the world! Thanks for dedicating your career to pursuing equality for all -- our country is better off because of you. #HappyBirthdayRBG https://t.co/p9cdn5u8HXWhat took you so long, @realDonaldTrump? These overdue sanctions must be the first step in a comprehensive approach to punish Russia for its past and continued assault on our democracy. https://t.co/8o03HAgHq0A child’s future shouldn’t be left to chance. Every kid deserves a quality, well-equipped school in their neighborhood to learn, thrive, and be inspired. #PublicSchoolsWeekSo proud of these incredible students! When it comes to gun violence in our country -- #EnoughIsEnough! Young people in FL and across the country are leading the way with courage &amp; perseverance - I'll continue to stand with them every day. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/m3Xd1dtvnsColumbine, Sandy Hook, Marjory Stoneman Douglas - #EnoughIsEnough. I stand with the students across the country walking out to demand action on smart, commonsense gun safety legislation &amp; honor the lives of those lost to gun violence. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/4b4cbhwXD3Small business owners won’t see enough of an impact to be able to hire new people and grow, yet big corporations are getting a massive permanent tax cut. Can you say #GOPTaxScam? https://t.co/srLithpAJGFACT: 60% of Americans oppose building @realDonaldTrump’s border wall. It’s a waste of money &amp; a symbol of his misguided immigration policy that goes against our American values &amp; rich immigrant history. #WallsDontWork https://t.co/H8MXJ73oMHHigh school students, teachers, &amp; community leaders joined me at last night’s Delray Beach town hall. These young people are saying #EnoughIsEnough &amp; demanding action on commonsense gun safety legislation &amp; increased mental health funding for schools. #NeverAgain https://t.co/OqE9EXi0pyUsing Russian Jews and other minority groups as scapegoats is a disturbing tactic that echoes anti-Semitic propaganda of the past. @POTUS, how can you stay silent? We must always condemn this hateful rhetoric &amp; speak out against intolerance. https://t.co/MnazhipSjZLack of adequate funding is the biggest barrier to rebuilding our nation’s crumbling infrastructure – the Trump #InfrastructureScam completely fails to address this reality. https://t.co/3DxetSybkpI joined @HouseJudDems &amp; @HouseDemWomen Vice Chair @RepLawrence in sending a letter to Trump's lawyers &amp; associates asking for answers about hush money pay offs. These transactions raise serious legal concerns &amp; have the potential for blackmail. We must get to the bottom of this! https://t.co/EMaPmCPBMNCouldn't agree more with @MichelleObama - in order for a country &amp; the world to be peaceful &amp; prosperous we MUST allow girls to get educated safely, free from violence &amp; discrimination. #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2018 https://t.co/cR95OkHSWDToday on #IWD2018 let's keep empowering all the women and girls who inspire us every day with their smarts, strength, and perseverance in the face of adversity. Happy to join my friend &amp; Co-Chair @SusanWBrooks as we fight for women's rights globally. https://t.co/coEjAcX0BMWhat if these same accusations had been made against @BarackObama? The Republicans would have 10+ investigations going! This has the potential for blackmail and we must get to the bottom of it. https://t.co/KqLBVNmqTPAmericans won’t be fooled – they know the #GOPTaxScam was designed to benefit the Mar-a-Lago crowd, not hardworking middle class families!The 5 deadliest mass shootings in modern US history occurred after Congress let the Assault Weapons Ban expire in 2004. These weapons of war don’t belong on our streets or in our schools - we need to reinstate the #AssaultWeaponsBan. #EndGunViolenceEvery Wednesday we demand to #BringBackOurGirls and today, @HouseDemocrats were honored to hear from two young women who bravely escaped from their #BokoHaram captors. Thank you for sharing your stories. https://t.co/sILWDTreh1The sad truth is that no part of our country is spared by the #opioidcrisis. As emergency room visits and overdoses continue to increase, Congress must commit the funding and resources needed to tackle this epidemic head on. https://t.co/tHb8GLnKeqMy friend, @NancyPelosi, is donating a few items from her election as the first woman Speaker of the House to the @smithsonian for its Women's History Initiative. I’m honored to join her this morning to commemorate those achievements. Check it out live! #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/7PHCfOmcaoThe #TrumpBudget is another in a long line of Trump Admin efforts to stack the deck in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families. https://t.co/qOa23OHS3mIt’s been nearly three weeks since 17 students and educators were murdered in Parkland. How much longer will @SpeakerRyan &amp; @HouseGOP refuse to take action to #EndGunViolence? #EnoughIsEnough87% of Americans agree #DREAMers should be allowed to stay in the US, yet Trump &amp; Republican leaders have sabotaged every bipartisan agreement. In fact, Democrats have offered 23 motions to bring the #DREAMAct up for a vote &amp; @HouseGOP has blocked every single one.
