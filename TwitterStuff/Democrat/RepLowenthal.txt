Family separation is a defining event of this administration. The callousness and brutality. The ineptitude. The xenophobia. It is heartbreaking. The response from the American people, though, is inspiring. Our voices matter, but we must continue to fight back.The news of the Annapolis shooting is heartbreaking. I am thankful every day for the hard work that journalists do to power our democracy. They deserve to live without fear. We must continue to work tirelessly to end gun violence, or the endless drumbeat of tragedy will continue.North Korea is expanding its Nuclear facilities, just weeks after their meeting with President Trump. This is disturbing, though not surprising. We can’t let tough diplomacy stall while danger still persists.  https://t.co/hhe3xvHegzThe President continues, after dozens of Russians were indicted for interfering in our election, to spout insane conspiracy theories and to attack the investigators. His @GOP allies are aiding and abetting this travesty. Together, though, we will hold him accountable https://t.co/1jgPuYieH6Justice Kennedy’s retirement could open the door to new attacks on the right to choose, LGBTQ rights, and anti-gerrymandering measures. I urge the senate to follow Leader McConnell’s example and wait to confirm a replacement until after the people have spoken in November.But ultimately, our nation faces a choice. We can invest in our middle class and our communities at home, or continue to increase the defense budget by billions every year. I will never allow our national security to be threatened, but I voted no on the bill. 3/3The defense appropriations package contains worthwhile provisions, including a record increase in funding for the STARBASE education program, which I championed. It increases military pay,  supports our allies in Europe and the Middle East, and works to tackle sexual assault. 2/3I cannot allow our country to continue to pour money into our military while so many live without healthcare, while our infrastructure is crumbling, while we can’t even support migrant families at our border, and other domestic priorities are overlooked. 1/3Family separation is a barbaric practice. The President is maintaining it, in spite of his executive order. I’m glad to see this court ruling, which declared that #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Cu0GVmfh2FHonored to speak this week with Nguyen Van Dai, a prisoner of conscience who was released from custody in Vietnam following action by me and my partners @TLHumanRights . He will continue to work for human rights, and I am proud to support him.We can’t take our eye off the ball: the @GOP has launched another stealth attack on our healthcare. This time, they’re trying to use the courts to end protections for preexisting 
conditions. We’re fighting back. We must expand coverage, not cut it!Another appalling decision by the Supreme Court this morning. Unions are the bedrock of our middle class, and are indispensable in our fight for a just and equal society. #UnionProud #UnionStrongI signed the #NetNeutrality Discharge petition to keep fighting for a fair and open internet. We’re standing up to the Trump FCC to #SaveTheInternetI have been deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court’s failure to act decisively on gerrymandering, but will continue to fight every day for #FairMaps. Politicians cannot draw districts for their own benefit. We need real democracy.Today is Equality Day, an important reminder of how far we’ve come in the fight for #LGBTQ equality- but also of how much work must be done. Too many still lack legal protection from discrimination. I’m still fighting to pass the Equality Act #EqualityForwardI am appalled by this decision, which allows demagoguery and racial animus to be cloaked in the pretenses of national security. The President could not have been clearer about his motives. The court chose to ignore them. Justice Sotomayor is correct: https://t.co/hqHs0JmQ9JIt should go without saying, but without due process, the federal government could deport anyone— even legal immigrants or US citizens. Laws protect the innocent. This kind of demagoguery has no place in our politics. https://t.co/DNzF24CIoeWe must have accountability for the architects of the brutal policy of family separation. Stephen Miller has no place in the White House and must resign immediately. 6/6Asylum seekers must be treated with respect by the system. They have faced overwhelming suffering at home, and our country must recognize and affirm their humanity. 5/6Immigration courts need the resources to provide speedy hearings and track asylum seekers in the US. 4/6The so-called zero tolerance policy must end. There’s no reason to detain these families on mass: studies show that the overwhelming majority show up in court. They want asylum hearings and the chance to stay here legally. 3/6Congress must act decisively. We can’t trust the Administration—even after Trump’s executive order, families remain divided. 2/6This weekend, at ICE and CBP facilities on the Texas border, I saw the full magnitude of this administration’s cruelty and callousness. Images of children in pens, desperate and alone, are haunting. What can we do? 1/6My deepest condolences to the family of Captain Dave Rosa of the @LBFD who lost his life in the line of duty this morning. His heroism represents the best of our community, and we will not forget him. https://t.co/n1GWYvQbunMonitoring reports of a shooting and explosion in Long Beach. My heart goes out to all affected. Thanks to @LBPD and @lbfd https://t.co/7eqhj0Q7IyThis week the @GOP passed their partisan &amp; extremist farm bill, including huge cuts to nutrition assistance. While detaining the children of asylum seekers, they’re trying to gut vital protections for children here at home. This bill must not become law! https://t.co/cHn54phR7aI thought of my family, who fled Eastern Europe and were able to settle here. We have a moral duty to treat these families, who are vulnerable, poor and suffering, with dignity and compassion. Families must be reunified immediately. 2/2What I saw at the border yesterday was devastating. Innocent children, and desperate parents, stripped of their humanity by cages and fences, uncertainty and fear. The fact that a tragedy of this magnitude is happening on US soil is shameful. 1/2This week @SEEC took a stand to #SaveLWCF , a vital conservation program which must be renewed. Watch the video! https://t.co/7Mhqkb6Fww46 years ago today, Congress passed #TitleIX. We’ve made so much progress in the fight for gender equality in education, but our work is far from over.I’m flying to south Texas to visit detention facilities. Many families remain separated and in jeopardy because of this Administration’s cruelty.  I need to see the magnitude of this tragedy in person. I’ll report back what I see.William Ngyuen remains in jeopardy in Vietnam. I joined @RepJimmyGomez @RepAlGreen @RepLouCorrea for a call with our partners at @StateDept to keep working for his release.A sad and avoidable death, and a blow to vital ecosystems. My Blue Whales and Blue Skies Act can protect these beautiful animals—and improve our air and climate! https://t.co/QPtwJUJjKiThe families that the Trump administration ripped apart remain separated. This crisis is far from over. Children are suffering because of the callousness of this presidency. Meanwhile @HouseGOP continues with their extremist, anti-immigrant agenda. We have to keep fighting.Watch now: I’m speaking on the House Floor to #SaveLWCF.  Our kids and grandkids deserve to enjoy our treasured natural spaces, too.  We can’t let it expire. https://t.co/nrkNdESIfULater today, I will be leading my @SEEC colleagues to speak out to #SaveLWCF because I believe that our parks and historical sites are worth protecting.The world needs our voice, and our leadership. It needs us at the table continuing to fight for human rights. Most of all, it needs us to lead by example, upholding human rights at the highest standard here at home. We’re failing, and it’s shameful. 2/2The UN Human Rights Council is not a perfect body. It has rightly been accused of bias. Nations with appalling human rights records sit on the Council and it often fails to live up to the promise of its ideals. Even so, the Trump Administration’s decision to leave is wrong. 1/2Both @HouseGOP immigration bills coming to the floor this week are unacceptable. They waste money on a pointless wall, fail to end family separation, and fail to provide real protections to #DREAMers. I will oppose.The President’s executive order can’t undo the cruelty of his family separation policy, which subjected thousands of children and families to trauma. He spent days claiming that Democrats were responsible for his crisis, lying to the American people. We will hold him accountable.The National Ocean Policy promotes thriving ocean and coastal ecosystems. Today, the President shortsightedly overturned it. This is a serious error, and will harm our efforts to bring together stakeholders to protect our oceans and our local economy.The President created this situation to try to extort money for a wall, while trying to blame Democrats. This level of pointless suffering can’t be a partisan issue. Family separation must end. https://t.co/FJcdVUbCo5Last night, DHS Sec. Nielsen denied that the administration’s family separation policy was designed to deter future migrants. Hours later, AG Sessions contradicted her. The policy is cruel. The images are heartbreaking. #Familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/yDYJ8AeBnbThe Administration can continue to try to distort the truth, but over and over they’ve tried to discredit the Special Counsel and the FBI, and over and over their claims have been debunked. Justice will win out! 2/2The IG report on the 2016 election is unequivocally clear: while the DOJ is not perfect, its actions have been consistently free of political bias. In fact, the department’s activities in 2016 disproportionately and negatively impacted the Clinton Campaign. 1/2I am disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to avoid a definitive ruling on partisan gerrymandering in Gil v. Whitford and Benisek v. Lamone, two cases which could have helped bring #FairMaps to all Americans. My statement: https://t.co/DNFfmXKDyYThis is dishonest fearmongering, designed to divide us from our ally and stoke anti-immigrant paranoia here in the US. German crime rates are at their lowest in decades.  https://t.co/TKs2CXeBWs https://t.co/H7tJViRP1hI call on @SpeakerRyan to allow a vote on the administration’s monstrous family separation policy. We can’t sit by while children are dragged away from their parents on false pretenses. Every Member of Congress must be on the record. 6/6Family separation is wrong, and the American people know it. It’s inhumane. It’s brutal. And in spite of the President’s efforts to stoke fears of mass immigrant crime, it’s unnecessary. The practice must end and it must end now. 5/6Separating children and their parents is traumatic and brutal. The images of detention facilities, of cages and chain link fences, are heartbreaking. As a community psychologist, I know just how harmful separation can be. The fact is, #FamiliesBelongTogether 4/6When the President demands that Democrats support his effort to overhaul the immigration system (including huge cuts to legal immigration and the wall) before family separation ends, he’s using these children as a to extort concessions. 3/6No law requires him to behave so cruelly. Family separation began as a result of AG Sessions’ “zero-tolerance policy,” which reinterpreted laws passed in 1997 and 2008. This means that the President could end this tragedy with a phone call. 2/6The President spent his morning on Twitter scapegoating immigrants and Democrats for his policy of separating patents and children at the border. He’s trying to dodge responsibility for his despicable actions because he knows they are wrong. 1/6It’s deeply troubling to see @GOPLeader leader pandering to the President and spreading a misleading smear against the Department of Justice. They claim to be the party of “law and order”- but not for their own President. https://t.co/eDrqb5FS5eThis week saw @GOP moving forwards on a disastrous bill for Californians, our economy and our climate. Check out my thread on what they’re doing, and how me and my @NRDems colleagues are fighting back: https://t.co/A93eaTfY92The President again defended the cruelty of the North Korean regime. It’s clear: he admires autocrats and constantly ignores human rights violations. Our strength comes from our position as a beacon for human rights. This rhetoric weakens us. https://t.co/oJc5uQL88PScott Pruitt’s baffling parade of  ethical misconduct continues. This time, using government resources and enlisted political donors to find a job for his wife. He can’t possibly claim to be working in the interests of the American people. #BootPruitt https://t.co/sKaqGYJhwkThe @HouseGOP this week released a partisan and divisive immigration bill, which spends millions on a pointless border wall, makes unnecessary cuts to legal immigration and continues to create uncertainty for #DREAMers. I strongly oppose this bill.This week, I was honored to join @audubonsociety where I was recognized as a Conservation Hero for this year. Thank you to the @audubonsociety; I am proud to be working with you to defend our wildlife! https://t.co/1EfRMB7hVKIf you needed any more proof that this administration accepts Scott Pruitt’s misconduct, look at this tweet. They believe ethical misconduct is acceptable, if it helps further their radical anti-environmental agenda! We have to hold their feet to the fire. #BootPruitt https://t.co/BohtW2iQTSI am deeply concerned for the welfare of William Nguyen, an American citizen being held in Vietnam. I’m working with my colleagues @RepJimmyGomez and @RepLouCorrea and @StateDept to secure his safety and freedom. My statement: https://t.co/fW23OBZi5iThis is unconscionable behavior, reminiscent of the darkest moments of American history. This policy is unspeakably cruel and unnecessary, and is being implemented callously and brutally. It must end now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/gwFYoqdePY@HouseGOP Working with my @NRDems colleagues, we’ll do everything to protect our coasts, and the wishes of our communities. 6/6@HouseGOP But the bill doesn’t stop there- it also authorizes huge giveaways of public lands with no regard for environmental protections. As ranking member of the Energy and Mineral Resources subcommittee, I’m leading the fight against this reprehensible bill. 5/6@HouseGOP California could be shaken down for over a trillion dollars, just to prevent oil and gas leasing off our coasts for a 10-year window! It’s a blatant and partisan attack on coastal states. 4/6@HouseGOP Under this legislation, any state that values its tourism economy, its coastal ecosystems or its quality of life would have two options: send cash payments to the federal government, or accept massive offshore drilling. 2/6Thread: @HouseGOP is sending California and other states a threatening message with a bill they’re moving through the natural resources committee this morning. That message is: nice coasts you have here! It would be a shame if something happened to them! 1/6I am deeply concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Yemen. I have joined with my Congressional colleagues, led by @repmarkpocan, to urge @DeptofDefense to avert more disastrous violence. https://t.co/gRB90D1nLzOngoing negotiations are vital, but this statement simply isn’t true. North Korea has not committed to any concrete or irreversible steps, and has already achieved many of its aims—a major propaganda victory. We must be clear and realistic about the nature of the threat we face. https://t.co/9X1uaQBBiIPremiums are already likely to spike due to the recklessness of the Trump administration. We need real congressional action to expand coverage, and provide lower costs for prescription drugs. 2/2The Department of Justice’s latest move to end protections for preexisting conditions is so outrageous that a senior career DOJ lawyer chose to resign rather than assist the lawsuit. This backdoor attack on our healthcare must not succeed. https://t.co/8s4X9NbUo9 1/2Women’s rights are human rights. And systemic abuse is all too real. The United States must continue to offer protections to the victims of these appalling circumstances. 2/2Attorney General Sessions’ decision to end asylum protections for domestic violence survivors is terribly cruel. The administration claims that domestic violence is not a human rights issue, but too many live under governments which cannot or will not protect women. 1/2However, North Korea, in addition to being a nuclear state, is also guilty of some of the most egregious human rights abuses of our time. This fact cannot go unmentioned in future discussions nor unchecked in future agreements. 2/2The risk of nuclear conflict with North Korea is so appalling that I am glad to see diplomacy taking place, however preliminary, and however imperfect. No one can say how these talks will end, but the process must continue. 1/2Two years ago today, 49 were killed and 53 were injured in a mass shooting in Orlando. Since then the death toll from gun violence has only continued to rise. As we remember the victims of that horrible day, let us pledge to keep working for gun safety legislation NOW.Yesterday’s SCOTUS ruling is a serious step back for voting rights, allowing states to impose significant burdens which disproportionately fall on poor and minority communities. I strongly oppose it. 

https://t.co/FhzbUV0kNNThe President spent the weekend picking pointless fights with our closest allies. His war on the transatlantic alliance is as damaging as it is baffling. This is not who we are.  

https://t.co/I5sw5jhUeZFamily separation is brutal, inhuman, and unnecessary. This is not who we are. This policy must end. 

https://t.co/wfRZaiASYYWe’re still fighting for an open internet. The American people have spoken loud and clear: #NetNeutrality must be the law of the land.Scott Pruitt’s endless parade of embarrassing stories about abuse of power and conflicts of interests are infuriating. But it’s nothing compared to the damage his agency is trying to do to our environment and public health. Here is the latest example: https://t.co/WBiYTmeFWEThis story is utterly heartbreaking. Children are suffering pointlessly. The administration’s family separation policy is unconscionable and unnecessary. It must end.  https://t.co/R3wbsPg5JOThis week I defended the National Ocean Policy, which brings together stakeholders to promote economic opportunity, national security and environmental protection. Healthy oceans are vital for our community and our nation! #WorldOceansDay Watch here:

If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255The Trump administration’s new legal attack on the Affordable Care Act could have devastating consequences, denying coverage to millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. They’ve already caused huge premium increases, but this could be even worse.I have long fought for, and am pleased by the release of Nguyen Van Dai.  He was innocent, and should never have been imprisoned. I thank the Vietnam Caucus and the Tom Lantos Commission for their tireless work in securing his freedom https://t.co/L9ms9etuVTPutin seeks to divide NATO, and President Trump is not helping the situation. The steps that the administration continues to take to turn away from our closest allies and engage with authoritarians is shocking. 2/2Allowing Russia back into the G7 would be a serious mistake. Russia was expelled for its invasion and illegal annexation of Ukrainian sovereign territory. Russia continues to pose a grave threat to the US and our European allies. We must stand up to them at every opportunity. 1/2This is heartbreaking. And it’s the price we pay for a world where the NRA and its allies and enablers come together to block real congressional action to #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/mLIkzJKkomTrump Tariffs on solar panels have forced companies to freeze $2.5 billion in green energy investments, and threaten thousands of jobs. Renewable energy is the future of our economy and our planet, and this is a devastating step in the wrong direction.@SenMarkey @StateDept All too often, people are persecuted for who they are or who they love. This is wrong no matter where it happens. No matter what, the United States must continue to lead the way for freedom and equality: to send a clear message that LGBTI rights are human rights. 2/2Today @SenMarkey and I introduced the International Human Rights Defense Act. This bill, which would direct @StateDept to defend LGBTI equality around the world, is backed by 65 of my congressional colleagues, and 19 senators. 1/2Trump’s irresponsible and unnecessary tariffs on our close allies are already prompting retaliation. This is bad for American consumers and exporters, and terrible for our global leadership. They must be reversed. 

https://t.co/G0LrL5vOQWThough the cause appears to be a simple printing error, we simply can’t tolerate this kind of inaccuracy in the electoral process. I hope all necessary precautions are taken to ensure that this never happens again. 2/2Congratulations to all those who ran, voted, or otherwise participated in yesterday’s elections. You are the bedrock of our democracy! I am deeply troubled by reports that thousands were missing from voter rolls in LA County 1/2This latest allegation against Administrator Pruitt goes beyond conflict of interest: he’s now using official resources to try to secure business deals for his wife. This is wildly unethical. His resignation is long overdue. We deserve better. #BootPruitt https://t.co/UT2ssz6LzyIf we saw this happening in another democracy, we would be sounding every alarm. I call on all my colleagues, Democratic and Republican, to come together to draw a line in the sand. Trump is not above the law. 2/2The President’s legal team spent a year lying to the American public about Don Jr.’s meeting at Trump Tower with Kremlin-linked lawyers. Trump’s campaign chairman is accused of witness tampering. And now the White House is asserting unchecked legal powers. 1/2There is one question these families want, need, and deserve to have answered: where are their children? After nearly four years the Mexican government still needs to answer. The decision yesterday is a huge step toward getting that answer.
2/2I applaud the decision handed down by a federal court in Mexico, requiring the Mexican government to reopen their investigation of the 43 missing students from Ayotzinapa. https://t.co/MATzv7yIbP 1/2Trump continues to blame his appalling policy of family separation on Democrats. This is outrageous and false. He introduced the policy in a cruel attempt to “deter” future migrants, who may legally request asylum here in the US. The practice MUST end.   https://t.co/JqgaWQkKEfCalifornians: get out and vote today! Find your polling place and check registration at  https://t.co/CyThB53ZpPMore bizarre stories of misuse of official resources by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

Every American should be deeply troubled. This is not a statement you’d hear from a man with nothing to hide. https://t.co/mBOpHcFhQCNo one should be denied services for their identity. Not for their gender, race or sexual orientation. We must pass the Equality Act to ensure that every American’s rights are protected by federal law. 2/2Today’s #SCOTUS ruling in the Masterpiece cakeshop case was disappointing. The ruling is narrow, but it could encourage the forces of bigotry and discrimination. 1/2Congratulations to Virginia, which voted last week to expand Obamacare and provide Medicaid coverage to almost half a million low income citizens. A real triumph in the fight to ensure that everyone has access to good healthcare.Separating families at the border is cruel. It’s unprecedented in recent history. The administration’s own data shows that it’s not deterring other immigrants— and it has been executed with a typical lack of planning and oversite. This policy must end.  https://t.co/ZTlMIhI1wMAnother attempt to discredit the investigations into President Trump’s conduct during the election has collapsed. There is no evidence of any improper conduct by the DOJ toward the President. Nobody is immune to scrutiny and justice.  https://t.co/WUlQICgXMuThe American people would pay higher prices for dirtier fuel. Our country needs massive investment in green energy and cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, the President is resorting to political ploys and hiding from scientific truth. It’s downright dangerous. 2/2This week, the administration announced a plan to force electrical providers to buy electricity from struggling, uneconomical, and polluting coal plants. This is a deeply misguided and wasteful move. https://t.co/t257SlWsR1 1/2It will not succeed. He will not successfully avoid being held accountable. The American people know better. 3/3As multiple members of his inner circle, including his personal attorney, national security advisor and campaign chairman face criminal charges and pressure to cooperate with prosecutors, this is even more troubling. 2/3Repeatedly granting pardons to politically connected Republicans, with no real legal rationale, is a clear abuse of power. The President’s pardon of Dinesh D’Souza, like his pardon of Sheriff Arpaio, could easily be a signal that political allies can expect special treatment. 1/3California has long led the way on fuel and emission standards. The Trump Administration now appears committed to taking away our state’s ability to set the best environmental standards in the nation. We won’t accept this lying down.  https://t.co/rEDUiY5vwGFor over a year, Chechnya has seen an ongoing campaign of harassment and terror, targeting the LGBT community. I was proud to join bipartisan colleagues to call on the administration to take a stand for human rights. Those who carry out these crimes must be held accountable.Our strength has always come from cooperation, from upholding international agreements, and from bolstering global stability. The Trump administration is throwing away all of that, and risks serious economic harm in the process. 2/2I deeply oppose the President’s reckless decision to target our partners in the EU, Canada and Mexico with tariffs. Not only do we face huge risks in a trade war—this unnecessarily divides us from allies whose support and partnership we rely on. 1/2Every other country in the world has indicated their support for the #ParisAgreement except for the United States. Trump’s withdrawal is a failure of his duties as president – we must be a leader on climate. The @CaucusOnClimate is #StillIn. https://t.co/I9AA9EyWP3Today is Gun Violence Awareness Day. Too many have lost their lives unnecessarily. We need gun safety legislation, and we need it now.

We need massive investment to boost resiliency around the world, as well as real action on emissions.  https://t.co/Gi2j8emc6WThe President’s family is profiting directly from foreign governments. The conflict of interest is obvious, but equally concerning is that the @HouseGOP won’t provide real oversight. Government serves the American people, not the Trump family. https://t.co/OXpXhC3iwDThis is appalling. The magnitude of the failure of the response to the Puerto Rico hurricanes is staggering and tragic. It is made even more horrible by the fact that the government is averting its eyes from the true scale of the disaster. https://t.co/TEsLeJFGNSOn this Memorial Day, join me in giving thanks to all those who have given their lives for this country and its freedoms. We must never fail to honor them and the ideals they fought for.The Supreme Court is nearing a verdict in its major case on gerrymandering, Gill V. Whitford. It represents real opportunity to end partisan electoral maps and provide true representation to every American. Don’t let politicians pick their own voters—we need #FairMaps for all!Gun violence continues to do terrible damage to too many American communities. Just this week the @HouseGOP voted down a measure to strengthen background checks and close gun show loopholes, against the will of the American People. Enough of this. Its time to actCongress authorized drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as part of a backroom political deal. It was the wrong decision. I’m proud to defend our public lands &amp; preserve vital ecosystems by cosponsoring legislation to reverse this bad deal.President Trump and the GOP are still working to undermine Obamacare. Attacking the individual mandate could trigger 15% premium increases across the country, and the uninsured raise will rise by 3 million. This is shameful. Healthcare is a right! https://t.co/eoRqznyzVYReports that Roger Stone sought information on Hillary Clinton from Wikileaks are extremely disturbing. Yet another example of Trump advisors working with hostile agents for political gain. One thing is extremely clear: the Special Counsel’s probe is no witch hunt.We’re continuing to make progress toward forcing action on #DACA in the House of Representatives. In spite of the refusal of @GOP leadership to stand up to right wing extremists, real relief for #DREAMers is on the horizon. https://t.co/sAY6mbfaLVAnother day, another conspiracy theory concocted by the President to attempt to shield himself from scrutiny of his pre- and post-election actions. He’s trying to sow confusion, but we know better. https://t.co/ReyKg91u5uMore worryingly, it appears that the US did not coordinate with our South Korean allies in the decision to cancel the summit. We’ve seen again and again that breaking with our allies makes us weaker. America simply cannot go it alone. 2/2The collapse of talks with North Korea is discouraging but unsurprising. I remain committed to a diplomatic solution to the crisis. However, it appears that the President behaved with his typical recklessness and lack of preparation. 1/2I am encouraged by the direction of the National Defense Authorization Act and I hope the ongoing legislative process continues in an open and bipartisan manner. However, I could not support the massive spending in the bill and I voted no. My statement: https://t.co/mWNBisKxYSA National Security Advisor plead guilty. The campaign chairman has been indicted. Dozens of Russians have been indicted and sanctioned. This is no witch hunt.

I’m working every day to make your calls a reality &amp; pass common sense gun safety laws NOW. #MarchForOurLives187,000 students have experienced a school shooting since Columbine. This is a uniquely American tragedy. And its only possible because too many powerful weapons land in the wrong hands. We need reform. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/YC6akC5phpOur country needs diplomacy and restraint. It needs adults in the room. It needs people who will stand up to the President. Bolton’s appointment could be terribly destabilizing. 2/2John Bolton’s record as an advocate for the Iraq War makes him a completely unacceptable National Security Advisor. I fear that he will enable the President’s most aggressive and reckless impulses toward Iran and North Korea. 1/2This week is the 10-year anniversary of the Long Beach College Promise, which has helped thousands of students to get a college education. I’m proud of role I played in its implementation. Every CA student will soon be able to receive the same benefits that LB students enjoy.Worse, the 2,000+ page bill was provided to Members of Congress with mere hours notice. Without time to examine the bill and all its consequences, I could not vote yes with a clear conscience. 2/2While I am glad that the Omnibus appropriations bill provided much needed resources to important progressive priorities, I ultimately felt I could not support it. It did not take action to protect DREAMers or to stabilize Obamacare exchanges. 1/2Today, I was honored to join Long Beach educator Nader Twal, and other recipients of the prestigious Milken Educator Award, to recognize their outstanding achievements in the classroom. Thank you for your service! https://t.co/v5fPm8VqUxNo one should face discrimination or harassment for who they are. Too many #LGBT students are vulnerable every day, and that must end. We need to pass the Student Non-Discrimination Act to enshrine protections into law. #SNDA #LetKidsLearnWithdrawing from Iranian Nuclear Deal could be catastrophic both for the stability of the middle east, and for the long-term credibility of American diplomacy. If we turn our backs, why would any negotiating partners ever trust us to stand by our word? https://t.co/vfNOnH05rLThe NRA gave me an “F” for my work to pass gun safety legislation &amp; #EndGunViolence once and for all. I’m wearing it as a badge of honor. https://t.co/EyRJseRiagI was thrilled to join @CommonCause today to speak about my fight for independent redistricting commissions, first in California and now nationwide. Self-interested politicians shouldn’t choose their own voters. We need #FairMaps to ensure representation for all . https://t.co/lmQsTpWowATrump admin attacks on science continue. There are reports that Scott Pruitt will restrict the use of science for policymaking at the EPA. When the facts don’t support his deregulatory agenda, he’ll try to ignore them. Bad for public, bad for country.  
https://t.co/EtsdKIWuqoThe Special Counsel’s inquiry has 19 indictments and 3 cooperating guilty pleas after less than a year. This is no witch hunt, it is vital to the safeguarding of our democracy. 2/2After a weekend of erratic tweets by President Trump, its increasingly clear that Congress must take immediate action to protect the Mueller investigation. I am proud to cosponsor the Special Counsel Integrity act to do just that. https://t.co/IwFyMjLS1e 1/2President Trump has again called for the executions of drug dealers. We must again reiterate that violent brute force can’t end addiction. We can’t be taking policy from the playbooks of brutal authoritarians.A major victory for #FairMaps! The Supreme Court has upheld new non-partisan congressional map in Pennsylvania. A good start but we need national reforms. https://t.co/UlshtcJniaFEMA has removed references to Climate Change from its strategic plans. This makes every American less safe. FEMA is on the front lines of our battles with climate change as we contend with flooding, natural disasters and other risks. Outrageous. https://t.co/LNT3bCCoJ9So inspired by all those who took a stand to demand action to end gun violence this week. I hear you, I stand with you, and I won’t let you down. Your voices matter. We must enact responsible gun safety laws NOW. #EnoughIsEnoughThe Senate’s bill to roll back oversight of banks is a colossal mistake. It makes our economy much riskier and threatens us all. I will fight this bill tooth and nail in the House. https://t.co/R680scKaTtEPA chief Scott Pruitt is working tirelessly with special interests to weaken environmental protections for their own short-term political gain. Again and again, donors and lobbyists come first. Meanwhile we’re left with the mess. It must stop. https://t.co/2oesfY7XTeFurther, we must remember that the Trump Organization continues to allow serious conflicts of interest for the President and his family. @HouseGOP continues to block real congressional oversight of these crucial concerns. 3/3As turmoil reigns in the west wing, the President must be reminded that any attempt to impede or interfere with the investigation will not be tolerated by the American people. The truth will come out. 2/3I welcome the latest news that the Special Counsel is broadening his inquiry into the Trump Organization. The American people deserve to know the full truth about the Trump family’s foreign ties, and his dealings with Russia. https://t.co/haT00liE2k 1/3Join me in expressing profound sadness at the loss of my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. She was an inspiration and a true champion for women and working families. Her voice is irreplaceable.Happy birthday to a true hero, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Her contribution to our country through her decades on the Supreme Court is truly remarkable. Join me in wishing her many more!This is Public Schools Week! I hope you’ll join me in celebrating our public schools and the critical role they play in our society. Public schools--and public school teachers--are the bedrock of our communities.I stand with our British allies as they take all appropriate steps to stand up to outrageous Russian attacks on their soil. https://t.co/s5D5dqQJzWCalifornians will keep fighting for bridges, not walls. We fight for tolerance and for our immigrant friends and neighbors. Despite the President’s unwarranted attacks and distortions, our state’s economy is booming. We continue to lead the nation.Testifying before the Senate yesterday, Interior Sec. Zinke appeared to backtrack on his plan to allow oil drilling off the Pacific Coast, citing opposition from California, Washington and Oregon. We’re making progress. Our voices matter.  https://t.co/5uCK0I18FSAnother important legal victory for our environmental protections! The EPA has been ordered to implement rules for smog finalized by the Obama administration in 2015. https://t.co/HhKHjGbWLqThis morning I joined #NationalWalkoutDay to fight to end #GunViolence. I’d rather pass a bill, but until @SpeakerRyan bucks the NRA and gives us a vote, we’ll never stop speaking out. So proud of those who made their voices heard across the nation. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/D9nHAyJ9wyThe State Department is the key source of American strength. Whatever happens, we must ensure that it is fully staffed with the experts it needs to guide our country’s foreign policy. We must continue to fight for human rights and to uphold the Iranian nuclear deal.The real inquiry is being performed by the Special Counsel, who has secured numerous guilty pleas and criminal charges. His progress has been remarkable and I have full confidence that he will ensure accountability and the rule of law.  2/2I have no faith in the conclusions of the House Intelligence Committee Republicans. From the beginning, they have been more concerned with obfuscation, partisanship and protecting their president than the truth. 1/2The President has repeatedly called for the execution of drug dealers. He’s taking policy cues from brutal authoritarians like Duterte of the Philippines. You can’t confront a drug problem with brute force. These offhand comments are unjust and unAmerican. https://t.co/SnQ799xKKdThe Arctic is currently experiencing an alarming heat wave. While we don’t know all of the ramifications, there is a real risk that climate change has already badly destabilized weather patterns in the region. We can’t afford to wait to #ActOnClimate https://t.co/QTZoBwHg61DeVos’ complete lack of understanding of education policy is sad and incredibly disappointing. Our children and our schools deserve better. https://t.co/sGZOKqM6ckAs we expected, Trump has walked away from the pro-gun safety reform stances he took publicly just weeks ago. One quick meeting with the NRA and all of those common sense safety measures like background checks and raising age limits evaporate. Tragic. 
 https://t.co/Pt060T0hHxThank you to @Defenders for awarding me a perfect score for my work to protect wildlife! https://t.co/ZcS1RPNnreWe can’t walk away from #DREAMers. They aren’t bargaining chips, or political props, whatever the president may think. They deserve better than the callous and cynical treatment they have experienced from the @GOP. We must continue to fight for them. #DREAMActNowTrump is trying to hide from a discussion about ending gun violence by focusing on violence in video games. This kind of political cowardice may have worked in the past, but not anymore. We need gun safety measures, and we need them now. https://t.co/0Zwa6lbwl9Trump administration has reversed itself yet again. It will now allow hunters to import tusks and other elephant trophies—something the President himself called “a horror show” just a few months ago. It’s outrageous and must be overturned. https://t.co/KlKQt4qBIIThis week @GOP launched two major attacks on public health. Below the radar, the house passed bills to loosen pollution rules for some coal power plants and manufacturing facilities. Totally outrageous.While I remain cautious about the long term, I applaud the decision to focus on a diplomatic, rather than military, approach to North Korea. Conflict on the peninsula could unleash unimaginable destruction and must be avoided at all costs.Thank you to @TheFAfund and @CSULB for your work in launching the Nohemi Gonzalez Scholarship. This opportunity, in memory of Nohemi, will keep her dream alive and give future students support to study art and design in Paris. https://t.co/nxhAFxBzWOTrump is speaking to witnesses about interviews with the Special Counsel investigators. This may not be illegal by itself- but it fits a pattern of a President totally unconcerned about legal or ethical norms, with no regard for constitutional safeguards. https://t.co/t6v7vkwkXUThe federal government is accepting public comments on their plans to allow oil drilling off the California Coasts. Your voice matters, so make sure they hear it loud and clear before Friday’s Deadline! Speak up at:  https://t.co/0KOBkjyRTTThank you, @WhipHoyer , and thank you for your continued leadership! https://t.co/rbPvRyh4OlWhen women succeed, our country is stronger, fairer and better. On #InternationalWomensDay join me in recommitting to fight for equality every day.More interference by Trump's political appointees in the scientific process. More than ever, we must pass my Scientific Integrity Act to ensure that our government runs on the best scientific, nonbiased, apolitical data. Our future could depend on it.  https://t.co/rP81XQyJwoCalifornia stands up to bullies. The administration is trying to stoke divisions with lawsuits—but it won’t work. We won’t be pushed around by Sessions and Trump. I’ll fight every day to make sure our communities are safe for everyone.
