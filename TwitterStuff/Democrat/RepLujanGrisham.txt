I cannot stress it enough to everyone — we have to be the watchdogs, we must immediately reunite these children with their parents, and there needs to be accountability for every administration. https://t.co/pbYHsFietpAt that moment, I couldn’t help but think about the children separated at the border from their parents. Those children call out for their mothers and fathers but no one comes.

This cruel policy change betrays our values, chips away at our shared humanity &amp; is a direct assault on girls, boys, mothers, &amp; fathers lawfully seeking asylum.The horrific announcement by the Trump Administration deprives some of the most vulnerable victims of domestic and gang violence from seeking protections from beatings, rape &amp; even death. https://t.co/FL8pOj3m25Due to extreme fire danger, several districts of the Cibola National Forest &amp; National Grasslands will be closed to the public starting Friday, 6/15.

However, this bill included provisions that would weaken vital protections on the largest banks enacted after the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. https://t.co/Is5gxztExoThe #SCOTUS decision is a troubling step backward for workers’ rights that will have serious consequences for millions of workers.

Millions of Americans will be denied SNAP benefits, and more children and families will go hungry.I came to Congress to solve problems and create economic opportunities for #NewMexico and the rest of the country. We had a chance to do just that, but unfortunately, the #FarmBill brought to the floor today includes provisions that will hurt so many people in this very state. https://t.co/dX5mU4oK6MWe have to support the entrepreneurial spirit in #NewMexico, including local startups.

Good news: Senate Democrats vote today to #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/Tqc2eGQHK5After explicitly ignoring millions of Americans supporting #NetNeutrality, @FCC voted to dismantle equal access to the internet. This decision undermines important protections for users. I’m supporting legislation to #SaveTheInternet, and today the Senate casts their vote. https://t.co/7DGJYhhReIPushing a partisan #FarmBill with those changes along with massive cuts to #SNAP will continue to sabotage any chance that Congress passes a bill that invests in farmers, promotes conservation, and ensures that low-income families have the support they need to make ends meet.The #FarmBill’s environmental and conservation provisions would gut longstanding protections for endangered species and cut funding for bi-partisan programs that preserve our nation’s natural resources, wildlife, and sensitive habitat. https://t.co/p1Iy8blhp0This House #FarmBill was not negotiated in good faith and does not reflect the bi-partisanship and collaboration that have been hallmarks of the House Agriculture Committee going back decades.Looking for something to do after school today?

This legislation would require the Department of Health &amp; Human Services to design a strategy to combat this very issue.This #MothersDay, I'm working with my colleagues to end preventable maternal death &amp; make this a national priority. Maternal mortality rates are used as a vital indicator of the status of women in societies across the globe, yet the US has the highest rate in the developed world. https://t.co/bmbjnk969G#HappyMothersDay!

I wish all of the graduates the best and extend my deepest gratitude and congratulations!Joining this important profession will be the 24 graduates of @EncuentroNM's Home Health Aide Program.
