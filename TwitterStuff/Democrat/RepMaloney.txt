Protesting @realdonaldtrump's despicable, inhumane &amp; un-American family separation policy at the National Day of Action to Fight for Families. Congress needs to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct &amp; start reuniting families NOW b/c #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/gYPzUs9TQbI march because #familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/II722afTPKThank you to my co-chair of the House Maloney Caucus @RepSeanMaloney for calling out @HouseAdminGOP on their refusal to list tampons as an "office supply item." Our female staff, like all women, deserve to have the supplies they need in the office. https://t.co/tWctMKXfyQ@openletterbot Even though I do not get a vote on SCOTUS nominees, I do have a voice and as I said yesterday, @SenMajLdr needs to hold true to the precedent he set in 2016 &amp; not hold confirmation hearings during an election year. https://t.co/2tFw2QT0fTNobody deserves to die simply b/c they showed up for work, &amp; the Capital Gazette conveyed that today w/ dignity &amp; grace. The best way we can honor the victims is by bringing #GunControl legislation to the Floor so that we can #EndViolenceNow @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/vg63IOTXzB@openletterbot Even though I do not get a vote on SCOTUS nominees, I do have a voice and as I said yesterday, @SenMajLdr needs to hold true to the precedent he set in 2016 &amp; not hold confirmation hearings during an election year. https://t.co/2tFw2QT0fT@openletterbot Even though I do not get a vote on SCOTUS nominees, I do have a voice and as I said yesterday, @SenMajLdr needs to hold true to the precedent he set in 2016 &amp; not hold confirmation hearings during an election year. https://t.co/2tFw2QT0fT@openletterbot Even though I do not get a vote on SCOTUS nominees, I do have a voice and as I said yesterday, @SenMajLdr needs to hold true to the precedent he set in 2016 &amp; not hold confirmation hearings during an election year. https://t.co/2tFw2QT0fTSo great to be on Roosevelt Island for a community town hall!

We must not hold confirmation hearings until after the upcoming election.  https://t.co/2tFw2QT0fT.@GOP refuses to pass immigration reform that our country needs. Instead, they've ripped families apart and have yet to reunite them &amp; #Dreamers still have no legal future in their home country. We need to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct &amp;  #DreamActNow. https://t.co/ugc6dRUnvQThis blatant dismantling of #DueProcess is unacceptable and cannot stand. Every person on trial, no matter the offense, is afforded due process under our Constitution and their rights must be respected and upheld.
https://t.co/HhIKviZ9DTAmericans from all parts of the political spectrum agree that allowing healthcare companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions - such as biological sex - is unfair &amp; wrong. That's why I stand with @HouseDemocrats to #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/lS0cxSTaDqWith Justice Kennedy leaving the court, every hard-won civil right is now vulnerable. Every woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices, marriage equality, labor rights and affirmative action are now at stake in an instant. 

Full statement: https://t.co/LufklJE6Ea https://t.co/wfkwfZ0bOX2yrs ago #SCOTUS reaffirmed a woman's constitutional RIGHT to abortion in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. Yet, @GOP lawmakers still don't want to accept a woman's right to choose. They've passed nearly 200 laws to restrict this right. We must cont to fight &amp; #ActForWomen https://t.co/Q2X5G6h2TaThank you @jfederations &amp; the 76 Jewish groups who wrote to the House @EdWorkforce Committee in support of my Never Again Holocaust Education bill, which would give teachers the resources they need to teach about the Holocaust https://t.co/SSUATSrffV@leslie_cassidy1 I couldn’t agree more and am a proud cosponsor of the #EqualityAct.@openletterbot You can continue to count on me to #resist.As Justice Sotomayor said, the Muslim travel ban was “rooted in dangerous stereotypes." The Muslim Ban IS bigotry and hatred. And I will continue to fight against it. #NoMuslimBanEver  https://t.co/OEaM97sd79#SCOTUS 5-4 ruling in the #Janus is an unprecedented attack on the rights of our country’s 17.3 MILLION public employees. This attack on unions undermines the rights of teachers, firefighters and police officers. I will continue to stand with unions. #unionproud #unionstrong@openletterbot I will continue to hold President Trump and this administration accountable for its actions. I agree that they need to tell Congress and the American people how they plan to reunite the families that have been separated.The Trump Admin has been failing the American people left and right, and #NetNeutrality is no exception. A free and open internet is vital to our democracy, small biz, and entrepreneurship. I will keep fighting to #SaveNetNeutrality. https://t.co/WUqcKcgTUl3 yrs ago, marriage equality finally became law across the country. Yet, in 30 states #LGBTQ ppl can still be fired, evicted or denied services b/c of who they are &amp; who they love. I cosponsored &amp; fight for the #EqualityAct b/c this is unacceptable. #EqualityForward https://t.co/f7vuOQPx88Shelby, Korematsu, Dred Scott &amp; now, Trump v. Hawaii. Today's decision joins a line of rulings history looks back on in shame. Religious freedom is a core founding principle of our country &amp; the Trump Admin's bigotry should make us all ashamed. #WeWillNotBeBanned #NoMuslimBanEverI will not stop fighting to #EndTheLies. No one should be allowed to deceive women and deny them truthful info about their #reprohealth. Fake women's health centers put women at risk and we must continue to #ExposeFakeClinics. https://t.co/zyVZMjiaYB5 yrs ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but Congress can act to change this. I’m working to #RestoreTheVOTE by pushing for the Voting Rights Advancement Act. https://t.co/wEfcL6ci8DThat AG Sessions can deny asylum to victims of gender-based violence w/ the snap of his fingers is just another example of why we need an #ERAnow https://t.co/aOBanfnmzxWe can’t let the Trump Admin get away w/ its chaotic methods. They’re condemning traumatized kids to more fear &amp; suffering &amp; it's unacceptable. @GOP Congress needs to stop covering this Admin &amp; start reuniting families by passing #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct https://t.co/vNycSW9NFz@openletterbot I’m a proud original cosponsor of the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct &amp; will cont to fight for its passage.

*Provide grants to #K12, colleges, states to support gender equity work https://t.co/GrQLZTeMERThis is completely unacceptable and inhumane. This administration needs to get itself sorted out and come up with a real, workable plan for reuniting the families it cruelly separated.

Didn't make a difference. All were detained.ICE is promising to find out where these men's families are and give them updates. I'm horrified that they don't already have that information.One man broke down when telling me about how his young daughter was ripped from his arms. This is inhumane and traumatizing.All 5 of these men brought their families to the US to escape #gangviolence in their home countries. They came hoping for a better, safer life for their loved ones. Instead they were separated from their children &amp; have received no update on their children since being detained.I'm leaving the ICE Detention facility in Elizabeth, NJ after having met with 5 men, fathers, who came here seeking asylum and instead were separated from their families. This is what they shared with me: https://t.co/9JcCBCPBMOStanding with my colleagues outside the ICE Detention Center in Elizabeth, NJ to share what we learned inside. My heart breaks for the fathers separated from their children today. #FathersDayOfAction #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/KALUGfyy3GFinally inside speaking with individuals who were separated from their children. These men were seeking asylum &amp; instead of being treated with compassion they were cruelly ripped from their families. Will address the media outside soon. #FamilesBelongTogether #FathersDayofActionAfter being made to wait over an hour. After having to deal with local PD. After banging on the door and making it clear that we WILL NOT MOVE until we're allowed in, ICE is finally granting us access to see individuals who have been separated from their families. https://t.co/coXJNdxsLPWe are at the ICE Detention Center in Elizabeth, NJ. where ICE is denying us entry to meet with fathers separated from their families.
