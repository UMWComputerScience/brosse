To call the police on a child cutting grass knowing young boys like Tamir Rice and others have innocently died by the hands of law enforcement shows us that comfort is becoming more important than the lives of our Black children.  This has to stop.

As an African American woman and a member of Delta Sigma Theta, I am appalled that this occurred in my district https://t.co/oCKDZaeqxXDon’t show us staged images.

1707 New Hampshire Ave., NW
Washington, DC  20009If you are in D.C. tomorrow, join me at a presser hosted by Delta Sigma Theta @dstinc1913 at 10 a.m. I will be supporting a declaration to end gun violence and call to action for reasonable gun control laws. #gunreformChanges in weekly wages from 1996-2015 (adjusted for inflation):

https://t.co/dvpZLIDBopAfter adding $2T to the deficit with their #GOPTaxScam, Congressional Republicans and the administration now want to cut billions from vital student loan programs, making college less affordable and worsening the student loan debt crisis. We must #StandwithStudents https://t.co/8p8FsxHw15It is up to all of us to continue to combat the negative effects of global warming, and to conserve the precious resources that we have for future generations to come. 
#HappyEarthDay https://t.co/rgA5O7h4VAI am deeply disappointed the conservation title remains the target for funding cuts. According to CBO, this Farm Bill cuts the conservation title by $800 million over ten years. #2018FarmBillSimply having a job is not enough to lift someone out of poverty. Teachers across America are striking for better wages b/c, despite working a full-time, salaried job, many are forced to use SNAP &amp; Food Banks to feed their families. That is not the American way. #2018FarmBillSNAP is the country's most effective anti-hunger program, helping 1 in 8 Americans afford a basic diet, with most recipients being seniors, children and the disabled. I cannot support a Farm Bill that will drastically cut these benefits. #2018FarmBillThe #GOPTaxScam means hardworking Americans will pay more. While Republicans claim we cannot afford Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. If Republicans really wanted to do middle-class tax cuts, they could have. #TaxDay #TaxScam#TeamFudge was more than happy to lend a couple of hands. #KeepAkronBeautiful https://t.co/G8ZNsyFEjtAttention 11th Congressional District high school students, the deadline for this year's Congressional Art Competition is on 4/18/18.

The time to act is now! #EqualPayDay #TalkPay #wagegap https://t.co/CBhe2EicrFWhile today is Equal Pay Day, this is not true for all women. Black women will have to work until August 7, 2018 to earn what men made in 2017,and Hispanic women will have to work even further.This is a disgrace and we have to do better by the women of our country. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/qJE8memTSGThe wage gap is not determined by what field a woman enters into, what her education level is, or even her race. These factors only determine HOW much less she will be earning than a man during her career. #EqualPayDay #talkpay https://t.co/Nn0QISQNRwThe wage gap is not only a women's issue it is a problem that affects all members of our society. When women lose out on upwards of $10,000/yr in pay that is less money they can take home to their families, and less they can contribute to our economy. #EqualPayDay #talkpay https://t.co/PXGCHMa8QrSince today is #EqualPayDay I will be doing a thread on the disparities that women face because they are continuously paid at a rate less than men.  It is time that we ensure workers receive equal pay for equal work. #EqualPayDay #talkpay #wagegap@dmyles728 Please visit https://t.co/VDnXpNqsWR to find more information about different events throughout the county.Urban Farmers please be sure to attend this FREE workshop.
