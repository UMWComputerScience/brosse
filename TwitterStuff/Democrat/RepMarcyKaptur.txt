Thanks @FPAction and @chefspike for having us on the "Plate of the Union" podcast. Let's continue this conversation on #UrbanAg and keep up the work to help improve our nation's agricultural system! https://t.co/WvBuWRrbdMI stand with @RepCartwright and @HouseDemocrats to strengthen public sector workers ability to organize and join a union after harmful #JANUS decision. 

More about the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act here: https://t.co/JJb2EO0Zsr #SCOTUSCleared another hurdle toward modernizing the Soo Locks, which is a critical transport link for America's steel industry.

There are few duties more sacred than delivering quality care to our veterans. https://t.co/qsTFat6qkXMore on the #GOPTaxScam from @NBCNews: 

"The Republican tax reform package that was supposed to raise wages and spur hiring has instead funded a record stock buyback and dividend spree, benefiting investors and company executives over workers." https://t.co/rnsNi8LHnHUntil we repeal #CitizensUnited, which threw open the floodgates for rich special interests to spend unlimited #darkmoney on our elections, we need common sense solutions like my bill to ensure foreign interests do not influence American democracy from the shadows. #REFUSEAct https://t.co/gkjpkyiNaBSimply, this is another extreme decision from the Trump-era #SCOTUS. This affront to public sector workers is a threat to workers in every profession and trade.This #JANUS decision is yet another assault on working people in this country and their constitutional right to collective action. I stand with the 17.3 million public sector employees including, teachers, firefighters and police officers whose rights have been trampled on.We need to restore #NetNeutrality.

#NetNeutrality protects entrepreneurs and small businesses in Ohio by ensuring they have a level playing field online. And whether it‚Äôs getting a job or an education, a free and open Internet is essential to America's success. https://t.co/kpd3VTBpqvüëáüëáüëá https://t.co/kFJQAhDLhuEvery citizen deserves to have their voice heard, in fair elections, with fair districts. Voting is a right, not a privilege. 

Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, Americans want full protections for their freedom to vote. It‚Äôs time to #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/Env1BPNf1hLast week we secured the release of 3 women who were being held at the federal immigration detention center in Michigan after the ICE raid in Sandusky.

In the meantime, we continue our work to ensure that these  individuals receive proper legal representation and basic care. #KeepFamiliesTogetherPleased to announced we have been able to secure the release of three women who were detained at the ICE facility in Michigan after the Sandusky raid, reuniting them with their families after weeks of separation. https://t.co/CINhYY5iEsMerging the Labor and Education departments is a cynical attempt to undermine public education and worker rights.

Stop the barbaric tactics! 

Instead of separating working families and creating chaos in our communities, we should create #ABetterDeal that lifts up workers in Ohio and across America! https://t.co/AqANd5iZYXWhat does the #GOPBudget do? ü§î

The U.S. should be a voice for human rights across the world, instead @POTUS has again chosen to take us backward. https://t.co/b5cRxwNYuq.@POTUS policy of separating children from parents at the southern border is inhumane and doesn't make us safer. This has more to do w/ cynical politics of division than sensible immigration policy. 

The Trump Administration must stop this cruel policy. #KeepFamilesTogetherWATCH: Last week I read stories of those who witnessed the ICE raid near Sandusky, OH that detained 114 workers.

Our immigration system is broken and we need comprehensive reform. The @HouseGOP inaction must stop. 

Lives are at stake and families are being torn apart. https://t.co/6on7c7w2roIn 2008, we faced a horrible economic crisis caused by the greedy speculation of Wall Street. Now, @POTUS and Congressional Republicans are rolling back these historic reforms and critical consumer protections.

My full statement: https://t.co/DUIcv0dgWJI look forward to providing the Administration with commentary from Ohio based firms and workers. The President‚Äôs willingness to be  flexible and exempt countries  like Canada and Mexico who play by the rules is a good step, but the devil is always in the details.Today‚Äôs decision from the Trump Admin. on steel and aluminum tariffs has moved through a prolonged and chaotic process with many delays. Nonetheless, I'm encouraged @POTUS has followed through on his promise to seek relief for America‚Äôs steelmaking communities &amp; workers.Today let‚Äôs recognize the history and progress that women have made across the world.

Congress has provided one important tool for achieving these goals by funding the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Even still, @POTUS plans to cut #GLRI by 90%.Though we welcome support from @EPA to combat harmful algal blooms, this plan does not reflect the urgency or accountability we need in this fight.
