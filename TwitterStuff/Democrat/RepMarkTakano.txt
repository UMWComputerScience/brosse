I am appalled by this decision and will continue to work with my fellow House Democrats to fully restore the rights of American workers to organize and fight for fair wages and benefits.  6/6This 5-4 decision hinged on the vote of a justice appointed by President Trump after Republicans refused to even hold hearings on President Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland. It will benefit the President’s wealthy backers at the expense of American workers. 5/6When union membership began to fall in the early 1970s, the share of national income earned by middle class Americans declined, too. Between 1980 and 2014, wages for the bottom half of American workers grew by only 1%, compared to growth of 205% for the top one percent. 4/6By denying these unions the ability to collect “fair share fees” from non-members who nonetheless benefit from the union’s work, the Supreme Court is setting up public sector unions to suffer the same sort of collapse that we’ve seen in the private sector. 3/6For more than 40 years, the ability of public sector unions to advocate on behalf of employees — both union and non-union — for better pay and benefits has been protected by previous Supreme Court precedents. 2/6Working families in America have been under attack since the day President Trump took office, and the Supreme Court’s unprecedented decision in #Janus is another blow that puts 17.3 million public employees at risk — including teachers, police officers, and firefighters. 1/6 https://t.co/YMfKS0owvRI can’t say it more clearly. This is a #MuslimBan. We have been here before. We cannot give in to fear. We cannot give in to scapegoating. This is un-American #wewillnotbebanned 3/3The dissent notes the "stark parallels between the reasoning of this case and that of Korematsu v. United States ... [where] the Court gave ‘a pass [to] an odious, gravely injurious racial classification’ authorized by an executive order." 2/3In their dissent in Trump v. Hawaii, Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg recognized the grave parallels between today’s decision and the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII. Chief Justice Roberts condemned #Korematsu, but the decision he authored echoes it. 1/3#NIFLAvBecerra allows so called crisis pregnancy centers to intentionally deceive women seeking information about their health. These centers are not healthcare providers and will put women’s lives in danger. #EndTheLiesDeeply saddened by SCOTUS’s decision to uphold Trump’s #MuslimBan. We cannot give in to scapegoating and hysteria. We mustn’t turn our backs on the immigrants that make this country strong or the refugees and asylum seekers it is our moral duty to help. #wewillnotbebannedThe horrors being inflicted on innocent children at the border echo one of the darkest periods in American history, the Japanese American internment during World War II.

President Trump must eventually learn that the best way to honor veterans is not through speeches, tweets, or parades, it is by taking the time to nominate a VA Secretary who is properly vetted and qualified to do the job.Last night's court ruling on #DACA forces the Trump administration to answer a fundamental question: Can it demonstrate that the decision to end DACA was based on anything beyond animus towards immigrants?
 
My guess is the answer is no.
https://t.co/qEbojT1ibhLike any large organization, the VA needs stability and continuity in leadership to succeed. The Trump administration has provided neither. The constant chaos is a disservice to the millions of veterans who rely on the VA for care.This amount of money, which the big banks saved in THREE MONTHS under the Trump tax law, is enough to extend the veterans caregiver benefits program to  veterans from every generation for FIVE years. https://t.co/KAwxqVRzcpHere's a montage of Republicans making promises about the tax bill that are directly contradicted by reality. https://t.co/O6lduUz8hvThere’s something unique about this ruling against President Trump’s attack on sanctuary cities: All three judges are Republican appointees. https://t.co/W54LgPw7KTCampaign Trump in 2016: I'll take care of our veterans like they’ve never been taken care of before.

#CesarChavezDayToday we honor all those who answered the call and served in the Vietnam War. The sacrifices made by these veterans and their families are immense and enduring. They deserve our admiration, our gratitude, and most importantly, our ongoing support. #VietnamVeteransDayIf misuse of taxpayer money was a fireable offense in the Trump administration, then the Treasury Secretary, Interior Secretary, HUD Secretary, and EPA Administrator would all be out of a job. This is the real reason Dr. Shulkin was fired… 

https://t.co/CgvWbyqBMl https://t.co/HH1SLUbpB2Let's be clear: Secretary Shulkin was fired because he would not allow private sector health care companies to profit off of veterans' health care.

"One Morning in Baghdad" by @ExumAM in @TheAtlantic: https://t.co/T40RVq42GK (with some understandably colorful language)Today, the 15th anniversary of the Iraq Invasion, has been marked by a couple profoundly important pieces of writing from the people who were there.The civilian/military divide leaves many people unable to appreciate the full cost of war, and leaves many veterans feeling isolated when they return home.

This morning, POTUS proposed investing in training teachers to fire weapons.

My deepest condolences are with all those who are mourning this terrible loss.Higher education should be about helping students realize their dreams, not helping Wall Street maximize its profits. That's why I strongly oppose the House GOP's higher education bill, which eliminates our ability to hold for-profit colleges accountable for defrauding students. https://t.co/gAOR15lJnRPresident Trump's refusal to address the chaos at VA HQ is unacceptable. With one phone call - or one tweet - he can tell the Koch brothers to get their hands off of veterans health care and let the agency focus on its mission. 

The longer this goes on, the worse it is for vets. https://t.co/XEWbOf4g4NThis is truly absurd: 42 million Americans owe roughly $1.4 trillion in federal student debt, and Secretary DeVos is trying to shield unethical debt collectors from accountability.

The Trump administration is once again defending corporate profits instead of vulnerable students. https://t.co/spC11kzWKYToday I'm thinking about the late March Fung Eu, CA's first female Secretary of State, who was born just two years after the 19th amendment was ratified.

No one becomes a teacher to get rich, but they must be paid a living wage. We have been paying our teachers far too little, for far too long.Pushing millions of veterans into private sector health care will undoubtedly damage the VA health system. But even more importantly, it will force veterans to visit doctors who are not prepared to give them the care they deserve.  https://t.co/aP66ydFer6#BlackHistoryMonth is more than a celebration, it's also a time for honest reflection.

Two federal courts have now found that discrimination based on sexual orientation is a violation of the Civil Rights Act. https://t.co/pQ7d8u729dUnion membership provides workers leverage in an economy where employers hold almost all the power. That’s what makes the #Janus case so dangerous.

My advice is to do what most Members of Congress do when the president makes a bold, uninformed policy proclamation: Ignore it.Since the GOP tax bill was passed, corporations have spent:
- $6 billion on pay raises and bonuses. 
- $173 BILLION on stock buybacks for shareholders.  

https://t.co/oECRsjZjayAs a teacher for 24 years, I can tell you that our schools need more textbooks, educators, and art programs. They do not need more guns.A Republican president just acknowledged that there are sensible limits to gun rights that do not violate the 2nd Amendment and can save lives. I hope my colleagues in Congress are taking note.The president claimed he issued the transgender military ban "after consultation with my Generals and military experts." 

We now know that was a lie. Instead of consulting them, he tried to exploit their credibility to justify a shameful, cowardly decision. https://t.co/wen3wbK8n1In 1948, there were 23 million American workers and 1,000 investigators enforcing our wage laws. Today, there are 7x as many workers but *fewer* federal investigators.

This is one reason why workers are robbed of roughly $15 billion in wages every year. https://t.co/GKoT5pq0FdIt is also a painful reminder that the legal precedent upholding their imprisonment, and the instinct to violate the rights of minority communities, are both still present in America seven decades later.Today is the 76th anniversary of #EO9066, which led to the imprisonment of my parents, grandparents, and more than 115,000 others of Japanese ancestry.

This #DayOfRemembrance is dedicated to the profound injustice suffered by so many innocent families.This is exactly right. The Koch brothers are using President Trump as a pawn to achieve their long-standing goal of privatizing the VA. It is up to the president to step up and put the needs of veterans ahead of his wealthy donors. https://t.co/bmgT1qbM18I’m wishing a happy Lunar New Year to all those celebrating in the Inland Empire, across the country, and around the world.

One party is unwilling to even allow a vote on legislation that could save lives. That is why Congress can’t address the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.We have spoken for the overwhelming majority of Americans that support simple, sensible steps to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/nW7XTin0UvWe have lost constituents to gun violence and mourned with their loved ones. https://t.co/gCsVuEZdGoWe have met with families desperate to protect their children, and promised that we would push for legislation to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/GKSsSp7lpvWe have sung on the House Floor to call for legislation to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/O5ErQiYNicWe have sat on House Floor for 26 hours to call for legislation to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/TZVQ1qhvfeOver the past several years, my colleagues and I have stood on the steps of the Capitol to call for legislation to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/jV8FwP0L9jNo. It’s not too soon to talk about gun violence. For so many families it’s way too late.No matter how many times I see it, the image of students walking out of school with their hands up is just heartbreaking.
 
My prayers are with the students, parents, and educators in Florida, and my thoughts are on what we can do to stop this horrific violence.It took all of two months for Wall Street to find a massive loophole in the Republican tax law.  https://t.co/y5BHB5u4EHThis is very odd. President Trump himself nominated Tom Bowman EIGHT MONTHS AGO. Then he was unanimously confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate. Now he needs to go? No wonder the Trump White House is in constant chaos. https://t.co/KlB5Za6BFMPresident Trump threatening to fire a 30-year Marine Corps veteran to please the Koch Brothers is really a metaphor for his policy on veterans health care.

For a child to be so consumed by this fear that they think to write it in a Valentine’s Day card…it just shows how corrosive and rotten this immigration debate has become.

These are the priorities I’m fighting for. #TrumpShutdownI’ll stay in session as long as it takes to get a real deal to reopen the government, because unlike @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan, I actually care about everyone in my community. #TrumpShutdownI’m still not sure what Trump wants. We’d be much closer to ending the #TrumpShutdown if he would just say what he wanted, and then didn’t change his mind on Twitter 15 minutes later.Trump wanted a “bill of love” on DACA, but rejected an agreement that met his demands. He should follow his original instincts, not listen to bad advisers like Stephen Miller and @SpeakerRyan. #TrumpShutdownRight now, the sun is rising in Washington, DC on the second day of the #TrumpShutdown. Any minute now, the President will find his phone, and issue completely new, ridiculous demands to be met before he’ll reopen the government.This year has read like a short story on what happens when you put people in charge of government who don’t really believe in the role of the government.

If @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr McConnell would put bipartisan priorities in the CR, it would pass easily.If you’d told me last January that @realDonaldTrump’s first year would have ended in a #TrumpShutdown because he couldn’t close an easy deal… I’d have found that completely believable.The #TrumpShutdown was caused by the “sh*thole comment.” Negotiations were underway, and then the worst instincts of the GOP base found their way in to the DACA debate.Speaker Ryan seems to be following the #HastertRule, even if it continues the #TrumpShutdown. Dems are ready to help pass something that gives to both sides, protect Dreamers, extend childrens health insurance, funding health centers. You’ll get my vote.Americans across the country, including California, need more funds for disaster relief, another bipartisan priority that @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan refused to include in their CR. #TrumpShutdownSpeaker Ryan won’t let a bill with a DACA fix come to the floor, which caused the #TrumpShutdown. My guess is that he’s worried the Freedom Caucus and @RepMarkMeadows are coming for his job.How can Democrats negotiate with @realDonaldTrump? Says he’s the best negotiator in the world, but when bipartisan Senators met his policy demands in exchange for DACA, he refused to take “yes” for an answer. #TrumpShutdownI am not quite sure who it is Democrats are actually supposed to be negotiating with. It definitely isn’t Trump, the supposed deal-maker. He may physically be in DC, but he’s mentally left for Mar-a-Lago. #TrumpShutdownIf Republicans love the children’s healthcare insurance program (CHIP) so much, why didn’t they just extend it when the authorization was up? Short answer: They knew they could use it as leverage over Dems, who genuinely care about CHIP. #TrumpShutdownIt’s hard not to see this #TrumpShutdown as the plan all along. He created the problem by ending DACA and then told his supporters he’d shut down the government unless he got a wall.@nathanplatt Because that's what they do. They pretend to care about issues like Children's Health Insurance, but instead of just extending it, they use it to bargain for things they really care about.One year after his inauguration, @RealDonaldTrump has led America into a #TrumpShutdown through bad faith negotiations and lies. We need a CR that funds CHIP and community health centers, includes recovery funds for natural disaster victims, and offers a solution for Dreamers.I’m in DC working to end the #TrumpShutdown.

https://t.co/tCzt4WTf2LNow is the time to pass a bill to reopen the government and address both CHIP and DACA.

(Next up: "This will create jobs") https://t.co/lrvYUbEs4nThis is not a middle-class tax cut. The majority of the benefits will go to the top 1%. 

This is not a jobs bill. Corporations will use tax cuts to reward shareholders and invest in automation.

A newspaper I respect once gave me “Three Pinnochios” for that claim. Yet, here it is. @SecShulkin says his goal is to eventually strip VA of its coordinating role in veterans care. https://t.co/KfZkMjsETk@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin @VFWHQ My colleagues and I have long warned that the Koch-backed model is designed to privatize VA...
Step 1. Undermine its coordinating role in the care of veterans. 
Step 2. Starve it of resources so it is no longer financially sustainable. 
Step 3. Privatization.@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin But most concerning of all is @SecShulkin’s vision for the future of VA care. Veterans advocates have long stated that veterans are best served by keeping VA as the coordinator of care. See this quote in the piece from @VFWHQ. https://t.co/7WQK9Ilsyi@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin This also means that when we outsource more care to private providers we lose accountability, oversight, and coordination between providers, which leads to problems like this: https://t.co/QTzDFIk0M3@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin Comparing VA to private clinics is “apples to oranges” at best. And, in most cases, the private facility is not keeping the same metrics at all. They just don’t have the legal mandate or incentive.@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin Later on, @SecShulkin says his goal is for more transparency at VA facilities to help veterans compare them with the private sector. The only problem: private health providers already lag way behind VA on transparency. https://t.co/wklCKEZexu@bkesling @PeterWSJ Right from the top, @SecShulkin is using the Koch-backed language about VA "competing" with private providers. Not good. Nearly all credible veterans advocates agree that the private sector should *partner* with VA, not compete for resources. https://t.co/K5CICPEeOTYesterday, @bkesling &amp; @PeterWSJ published an article from a recent interview with VA Secretary David Shulkin. The quotes they captured should be deeply concerning to anyone who cares about the future of the Dept of Veterans Affairs.

Trump: Why can't these samurai shoot down a missile? https://t.co/Zz26HrZNYfMass shootings are so frequent now that by the time it's "okay" to talk about guns another tragedy has already struck another community. https://t.co/vhNtM9r1de@RepDelBene Let's be clear, this is not a "middle class tax cut." Working families get the crumbs and the super-wealthy get everything else. /end@RepDelBene And this is on top of a $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut.@RepDelBene Corporations are still allowed to deduct moving expenses. Families are not.@RepDelBene Corporations are still allowed to deduct more than $10,000 in property taxes. Homeowners are not.@RepDelBene Corporations are still allowed to deduct business expenses. Teachers are not.@RepDelBene Under the Republican plan, corporations are still allowed to deduct state and local taxes. Workers are not.This remarkable line of questioning from @RepDelBene shows how GOP tax plan treats corporations better than people. https://t.co/KmZxuLhQRrIf you're wondering how, read this @davidckamin analysis. If you're wondering why, you don't know the modern GOP. https://t.co/BE3LJuq8rFThis is really something. The Republican tax bill lets people like President Trump keep SALT deduction - but strips it from regular workers. https://t.co/b6am9bKaNBJust horrified by the tragedy in Sutherland Springs. This type of violence should be unimaginable. But it's not - and we must consider why.The @HouseGOP are voting to cut $6.3 billion from public health funding while pushing a $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut. #WhatsWrongWithYou https://t.co/R3t7btO763In short: Californians pay more, global corporations &amp; super-wealthy pay less, struggling workers get nothing. https://t.co/pvLio637nQ"Mr. T, why do we all have to share notebooks?"
"Well, class. Global corporations need tax breaks to repatriate overseas illiquid assets..." https://t.co/9yWr5LYzw9@HouseGOP UPDATE: The tweet is gone but the provision sticking it to teachers remains. I used this deduction when I taught! https://t.co/5PQX9a0pUJThank you, @HouseGOP, for going after the real freeloaders in our tax system: Teachers who use their own money to buy supplies for students. https://t.co/CAR2baiMnVBecause, as we all know, America’s families are enjoying record profits while corporations are barely making ends meet.Nothing says #GOP like a plan that pairs massive and permanent corporate tax cuts with a small bump in the child tax credit.POTUS - who only hires the *best people* - tried to hire a homophobic talk show host with no scientific expertise as USDA's chief scientist. https://t.co/4JP1tTGzomIt's a special night in Southern California. I'll be rooting for #ThisTeam and thinking of the fans who haven't slept well in about a month.As GOP prepares a tax cut for the top 1%, let's review the other cuts they'll make so that it only adds $1,500,000,000,000 to the deficit. https://t.co/4JfSogJLmNUndermining America's 242-year commitment to due process and the rule of law is not an acceptable response to an attack on American values. https://t.co/924KT0fXqDOpen enrollment is here! Affordable health insurance plans are available. Get you and your family covered at https://t.co/SlmyJO8veY.A thing I learned from 24 years of teaching: People who do major projects at the last minute never fail.

Wait, no. That's not right at all. https://t.co/xAa7aChsvsMy thoughts are with the people of New York City tonight and the victims of this cowardly act. A tragic day for an incredible city.My office is tracking the incident at Castle View Elementary. Parents should follow @RUSDLink for updates as they become available.John Kelly's comments fit the pattern of a WH that is unable (and unwilling) to grapple with the roots of systemic inequality in America. https://t.co/WIcXQ2Zz9sOur democracy depends on checks and balances. The judicial branch is really holding up its end of the bargain today. https://t.co/q5OR79Q5XtThe charges unveiled today - and POTUS's response - show the seriousness of this investigation and our duty to protect it from interference. https://t.co/xDylVyWWB2Everything about the Whitefish deal screams malfeasance. I join my colleagues in demanding a thorough investigation. https://t.co/7FR3OrkBDOTo recap the GOP position: The Children's Health Insurance Program must be paid for, but tax cuts for the wealthy can go on the credit card.A rushed &amp; secretive process, fraudulent math, and tax cuts for the wealthiest families.

GOP tax reform feels a lot like GOP health care. https://t.co/vTkpjzXJ6eListening to Dreamers describe the fear and anxiety they experience every day is heartbreaking. America can do so much better. #DreamActNOW https://t.co/QYO0hffo5RAfter receiving a $700 billion taxpayer bailout, rolling back Dodd-Frank, and returning to record profits, big banks really needed a win. https://t.co/YyvtnTOoINCorporations like Equifax can now continue using forced arbitration clauses to deny consumers their day in court. Thanks, GOP. #GOPpopulism https://t.co/3NtbuxWjDh@SecShulkin And above all, I'm grateful for the dedication of the veterans groups that testified today. Thank you to all veterans for your service. /endI appreciate @SecShulkin's willingness to work toward a bipartisan agreement that ensures veterans get the high-quality care they earned. 8/Community care will continue to have an important role in vets care, but it should be based on clinical need, not politics or ideology. 7/Most importantly, it puts health decisions in the hands of veterans &amp; doctors, and addresses major issues in the current Choice program. 6/The congressional GOP bill is more promising &amp; more likely to result in a strong, sustainable VA that can get vets the care they need. 5/It's also missing key details, including estimates of cost &amp; how care would be coordinated, which could raise more serious issues w CARE. 4/However, the Admin's new proposal (CARE) still has me &amp; many veterans grps concerned that it would undermine VA's capacity to serve vets. 3/Given POTUS's reckless rhetoric about the VA, it's gratifying to see bipartisan agreement on preserving VA's central role in vets care. 2/The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs just completed an important hearing on the future of VA health care. A few of my thoughts... 1/Love the hashtag, but why do Republicans only care when POTUS lies about them personally and not when he lies about taxes, health care, etc? https://t.co/gVJft3n1J2Today, @RepPaulCook &amp; I asked Congress to support a nationwide Work for Warriors program, which would help those who serve while saving $$$. https://t.co/2vKrR1PcObIt is profoundly sad and frightening to have a president who is unable to act like a decent human being. https://t.co/2U8wAhN19xA heartfelt thank you all those who have contributed to the proud tradition of the @USNavy. #242NavyBday https://t.co/kjnzGgXeZpPOTUS is listening to Fox News instead of his own nat'l security advisors. The result is a public relations strategy instead of a real plan.Pulling US from #IranDeal would betray our allies, embolden our enemies, and close off our best option for curbing Iran's nuclear program.Threatening to abandon PR, ending DACA, sabotaging the ACA..these are acts of a POTUS who does not accept his responsibility to the country.This thread (&amp; this issue) is not getting nearly enough attention. A new DHS secretary was nominated yesterday but many key jobs are vacant. https://t.co/Ug9jGPSSlcMost Americans are astonished to learn there are deported veterans living in Mexico. But it's happening and they're struggling. We can help. https://t.co/AoHQqbvW00Children's Health Insurance Program: expired.
Community Health Center Fund: expired.

And @HouseGOP voted to name 6 post offices yesterday.Let's call this what it is: A 12.4% Trump Tax on health care. https://t.co/Oufm9nvqlQMillions of individual acts of bravery made the #equality movement possible. Your courage inspires me every day. #NationalComingOutDayThe #TransBan was not about military readiness or unit cohesion. It was about blatant bigotry. WH's response to this letter will prove it. https://t.co/Df6mMF7yeyThis is the VA at its best: A new program will identify and then provide food to hungry veterans. https://t.co/WQNhSSKAEJSecretary DeVos’s support of for-profit colleges is simply indefensible. https://t.co/XV0VWHtwhiWeapons that allow one person with no military training to shoot 600 people from 400 yards away have absolutely no place in our streets.President Trump's bizarre behavior in Puerto Rico is more than cringeworthy. It reflects a lack of empathy &amp; urgency that is deadly serious.I join my community in mourning the victims of the tragedy in Las Vegas. My deepest condolences to their families. https://t.co/DMSVu6TXhALast week @SecretaryPerry ordered energy regulators to issue a rule subsidizing coal for the sake of "grid resilience."
