Michael Cohen, save yourself. Flip, flop, do the drop.Manafort, now that you know, will you join with organizations attempting to create fairness in the criminal justice system by supporting the Solitary Confinement Reform Act (S.2724)?Giuliani needs to shut his mouth and stop lying and then walking it back, disparaging women and undermining Mueller, and believing that anybody thinks he has any real credibility.Now that President Trump has created a trade war and issued tariffs against China, does that mean President Xi will revoke all of the trademarks for Ivanka's sweatshop operations in China?Thank you to the 640 UM church members for bringing charges against AG Jeff Sessions for his immoral attack on families and children in the name of the Bible. Separating children from their parents demands an investigation by the church.  Kick him out in the name of the Lord!Remember when I said Trump &amp; his allies are scumbags? Trump is an immoral, indecent, &amp; inhumane thug.  He loves Putin, genuflects for Kim Jong-un, loves killer Duterte, wants to be in power for life like Pres. Xi, &amp; is willing to sacrifice children. He needs 2B stopped. Impeach45@KimKardashian .@rubiales64Giuliani, I join with the crowd of 46,583 fans in Yankee Stadium from earlier this week:

BOO!I really enjoyed visiting with the students, student ambassadors,  staff, and faculty today at St. Mary's Academy in my district (Inglewood)! https://t.co/Q9dxmw2xdBToday, I was so pleased to attend a very special ceremony celebrating the construction of the Torrance Transit Regional Park and Ride Terminal in my district! https://t.co/VJumwIo08U#ConManDon is so quick to condemn athletes peacefully protesting police misconduct, but Trump said nothing when Roseanne Barr butchered our national anthem, grabbed herself, and spit on the field. ABC did the right thing. Now Congress needs to 'cancel' Trump.No no no, #ConManDon. No matter what you wish, your lawyers Emmett Flood and Rudy Guiliani cannot be included in the classified briefings, and neither can your friends Kanye West and Roseanne Barr.You did it again #ConManDon.  You were inappropriate during 2018 Memorial Day events, inappropriate at the Boy Scouts' jamboree, inappropriate w/ the Native American Tribal leaders, inappropriate on the Access Hollywood Bus &amp; you were absolutely inappropriate w/ Stormy Daniels.Another #ConManDon lie! Now you're saying Bob Mueller is interfering in the midterms? You are so quick to lie on Mueller yet you will never admit your buddy Putin interfered in the '16 elections and is already interfering in the 2018 midterms. Your patriotism is in question.#ConManDon, you say it's Dems who are responsible for separating children from their mothers @ the border? Lies. You better locate the displaced children &amp; return them to their parents. Americans cannot live w/ this immoral atrocity.The moment of keeps: Giuliani, keep talking. Mueller, keep connecting the dots. Rosenstein, keep saying no. Stormy, keep storming.Trump, further isolating the United States, thinks he knows better than our negotiators and all of our global allies who agreed to the Iran deal.  How long do we have to suffer his gigantic ego and narcissistic behavior? Impeachment is the only answer.Tillerson, Spicer, Flynn, Price, Scaramucci, Bannon, Gorka, Porter, Cohn...#bebestBe best? Give me a #BeBest break. White House "be best" bully, role modeling for our children?! Give me another break.https://t.co/4EagIzjDAb via @TeenVogueReclaiming My Time: Magazine Names Rep. Maxine Waters Among 100 Most Influential https://t.co/HrwGD7AAwRTrump &amp; his backroom advisor Sean Hannity are bosom buddies -- both getting advice from the "fixer" Michael Cohen. Can't wait for the tell-all tapes.  Get ready for impeachment!!Nikki Haley, why are you aligned w/ Trump?  What is it about him that makes you want to suffer endless humiliation? If you are concerned that Larry Kudlow and Trump think you are confused, why are you staying? How can you accept his lies &amp; his policies?Thank you @TIME and @YaraShahidi for this tremendous recognition! I'm honored to be included on @TIME's list of the world's most influential people #TIME100 https://t.co/ECjV4UBiHFToday, I introduced #HRes821 recognizing the importance of the iconic Vietnam Veterans Memorial, its extraordinary replica which travels in The Wall That Heals exhibit, &amp; the distinguished veterans of the Vietnam War. Here are more photos from the exhibit's stop in @CityofGardena https://t.co/SSUiD2L3dXSan Pedro man expected to plead guilty to threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters https://t.co/PN2rTt2M4P via @ladailynewsTrump, you can't have Cohen broker an NDA &amp; payoff to Stormy to keep her from talking about your affair &amp; then deny you knew anything about it. Your lies are catching up w/ you &amp; the con won't work. This may be your "come to Jesus" moment before impeachment.Everyone knows Cohen has been Trump's go-to lawyer &amp; fixer, protecting him in lawsuits &amp; representing him in all sorts of shady dealings. I believe his office is a treasure trove of information. Don't forget Cohen's involvement w/ Flynn &amp; Sater in trying to lift Russian sanctionsNo matter what 45 says, #Rosenstein, the acting US attorney in Manhattan, and a federal judge would not have agreed to this raid on Cohen unless there was sound reason to do so. Trump can complain all he wants. The road leads to #Impeachment!I was so honored to help bring and welcome to the @CityofGardena "The Wall That Heals," a 350-foot-long replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. https://t.co/yYFfe9mwXDOfficials welcome Vietnam ‘Wall That Heals’ to Gardena – Daily Breeze https://t.co/cEtsXcngaDDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was an impassioned freedom fighter, drum major for justice &amp; real-life hero. May the world continue to honor his legacy and struggle to make our democracy one that is more equal and just for all. #MLK50The recently revealed memo from #Rosenstein that clearly explains Mueller's authority to proceed w/ the investigation into #Manafort's ties to Ukraine &amp; collusion w/ Russia shows Manafort's attempts to block this investigation are baseless. #Mueller, just keep connecting the dotsToday I mourn the loss of my dear friend &amp; one of the greatest leaders &amp; activists in the world: Winnie Mandela. I worked w/ her on the release of N. Mandela &amp; to end apartheid in South Africa. We should all pay tribute to Winnie's persistence in the face of injustice &amp; racism.America, what you just witnessed, w/ what may be one of the largest organized rallies this country has ever experienced, epitomizes the power of articulate, brilliant, &amp; creative young people who are offering our country inspired new leadership.The NRA has met its match. While elected officials have all too often bowed down to the pressures of the gun lobby, a new day is upon us.  The NRA is no match for the powerful voices of young people from across the country who are demanding change.Wow! What an exciting moment we experienced in our history w/ these young people who are leading a revolution. I'm so proud of their leadership, courage, and determination.  These young people know what it means to witness gun violence. How can anyone ignore them?I am heartbroken by the passing of my dear friend &amp; colleague, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. She was a phenomenal woman of impeccable integrity. I extend my deepest sympathies to her children, grandchildren, family, &amp; constituents during this difficult time.I am proud to join women all across the world in celebration of International Women's Day, which is an annual recognition of our progress and a reminder of our responsibility in the ongoing struggle for equality, justice, and peace. #IW2018 #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/SCRea9cpu3@theGrio @ReignOfApril 9okImagine the President of the United States rolling around the West Wing, disoriented, ranting, angry, carrying on and paranoid, dreaming up public policy -- it's a dangerous thing for America. Get ready for impeachment!We might also inquire of Stormy Daniels about Trump's mental state since  she has observed him up close. I'm sure she could give us a revealing interpretation of her observations.For a president whose own staff &amp; appointees have referred to him as ignorant, stupid, &amp; whose own Sec. of State Tillerson has not denied calling him a moron, Trump needs to get out of the name calling game.John Kelly needs to resign.If you're wondering why Kelly couldn't keep his lies straight -first trying to defend wife beater Porter, then claiming he voluntarily resigned,then claiming he fired him - this is the same person who lied on Rep.Wilson. Even after video proved him a liar, he refused to apologizeJohn Kelly is also complicit in knowing that Porter had a history of wife beating. This would've been revealed in the investigative reports that were so clearly identified by FBI Director Wray when he testified before the United States Senate.John Kelly is presiding over a White House that is in chaos and dysfunction. He is complicit in both Rob Porter and Jared Kushner working at the highest levels of government without security clearance.What? Oprah insecure? I don't think so. As a matter of fact, Oprah is richer than you are. Deal with that. Not true? Show your tax returns!Watch my video below on the questions I asked Treasury Sec. Mnuchin about why he &amp; Trump are not implementing the sanctions against Russia that Congress passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. https://t.co/Ex7Fto1OaJDoes anyone need to ask why Russians supported Trump &amp; worked to defeat Hillary? Isn't it obvious? I've said over &amp; over again that I believe this president has a commitment to Putin to lift the #Obama sanctions &amp; to not impose new sanctions Congress passed w/ bipartisan support.So where are all the patriotic Republicans? Do they stand with this lying president or do they have the love of country they claim? Will they insist on the #impeachment of Trump as the facts are revealed about his campaign's collusion with Russia?To my colleagues who signed my letter to protect Mueller from being undermined and fired, let's continue to insist on protecting both #Mueller and #Rosenstein!Mueller is on his way to revealing the #kremlinklan I've always talked about.Congratulations to Mueller on the 13 indictments! You're doing a great job! Don't stop. I've always believed you could connect the dots!Thank you @oureric for the wonderful feature in @ELLEmagazine!

So are Trump's gargantuan ego, pathological lies, and his obvious insanity.  Ok Republicans.  Keep standing with him and you will all go down with him.The famous poet Maya Angelou said "when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."  America, what more do you need to know about 45?  Now nuclear war threats?!Impeachment is the only answer.A message to Mueller: Stay strong and stand tall. Continue to investigate them all. You are indeed answering the people's call. The Kremlin Klan is going to fall. Around you the Democrats are building a wall.

Knowing everything, lying on everybody, bullying everybody, claiming to be holy, righteous and loving America more than anybody else. Speak up now - admit you just got your butt kicked royally and MORE to come.How many diet cokes did Trump consume while he gulped and waited for the defeat of his pedophile candidate?? #swishswishI thought Republicans were opposed to deficits. Your #TaxScamBill proves you are just lying tax and spend Republicans, adding $1 trillion to the federal deficit and a huge burden on our children's future.Cold blooded Trump &amp; Mulvaney are committed to killing the #CFPB - an agency that has proven to protect consumers from rip offs, fraud &amp; corporate tricks. Why would any decent elected or appointed leader fight against protecting hardworking Americans against this kind of abuse?The facts relative to Tillerson's mismanagement of the State Dept reveals his disinterest in foreign affairs. He was only there to help lift the oil sanctions on Russia so Putin could drill in the Artic and so his former company Exxon could earn more profitRoy Moore is a liar, a pedophile, a sex predator, and apparently Trump's kind of Senator. He claims not to know any of the women that he violated when they were girls, but no credible person would believe that many women would come forward because they have nothing better to do.Mr. President, there is help for your deteriorating mental health. It's called admitting guilt and telling the truth.Trump: Flynn admitted lying to the FBI. Sally Yates warned you that Flynn had been compromised by your friend Putin. You should've listened. Thank you Sally Yates!Lock him up, lock him up, lock him up, lock him up.#FlashbackFriday https://t.co/BxdM13Bz9AReports are that Trump will force Tillerson out of the State Department but the question is whether Trump first asked Putin for his permission. Maybe Trump will replace Tillerson with Ivanka. They all deserve one another.Trump is at it again. In private, he is still claiming that Obama was not born in the US. So what are we to think about Trump &amp; his family claiming to be from Sweden when they were of German descent. Why wouldn't he shake his German cousin Chancellor Merkel's hand?Trump's deteriorating condition demands action from the Congress of the United States. Does he really think that's not his voice on the Access Hollywood tape?The men &amp; women of the @CFPB fight to protect consumers every day. We can’t let Trump ignore the law and Congress by unlawfully installing a member of his cabinet as Acting Director in order to destroy the Consumer Bureau from within. #DefendCFPB https://t.co/lJb08NSJIT@billyeichner Thank you!Thank you @NDVets for this tremendous honor and the "Legacy Award"!

Kelly, you earned 4 stars &amp; had a successful career. Now you've fallen prey to a "moron" in an effort to protect his career. Apologize.If the wife and family of Sgt. Johnson feel they were disrespected by Trump, then they were disrespected. Period!Gen. Kelly has been tainted by Trump lying in the face of facts. Hasn't he seen the same video of Rep. Wilson that everyone else has seen?General Kelly has lied. Rep. Wilson has conducted herself w/ dignity. The only empty barrel I see is the one in the Oval Office.Even the most honorable people are not immune to being overtaken by the filth wreaking from the Trump White House day after day.What is it about the Trump White House that transforms everyone into liars?Trump has no business calling anyone "wacky" when his own Sec. of State is ashamed of him and thinks he's a moron.#StandWithWomenThis Hispanic Heritage Mo., never forget, Trump flew to PR, threw paper towels @ hrcn victims &amp; once said Mexicans were rapists &amp; criminals.Tillerson's plans are backfiring.

Duke, but Duke said white supremacist rally was done to fulfill Trump's promises. Do you know him now,Trump?Don't forget, Trump offered to pay legal fees for those who attacked protesters at his rallies. Will he be making that same offer now?Trump defined himself during campaign.
