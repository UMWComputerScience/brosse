#BREAKING: Multiple people have been shot at Capital Gazette Newspaper in Maryland. I thank the brave first responders helping the victims. Communities across the country are far too familiar with active shooter situations.This analysis is relevant to our responsibility to conduct oversight of national security policy. We expect the report in classified or unclassified form by August 1st.This request should not be difficult as the report was used to argue the ban’s constitutionality and cited in the majority opinion issued after #SCOTUS’ recent decision on the #MuslimBan.I, along with some of my @HASCDem and House Intelligence colleagues requested a classified report of the analysis the Trump Administration undertook before issuing a revised Muslim Ban. https://t.co/o51XOkoewXUnion workers earn higher pay and have more access to medical benefits, retirement benefits, and paid leave than workers who are not unionized. I stand with our #Union brothers and sisters. #JANUSvsAFSCME https://t.co/HEfJPStTwdWe need immigration reform that is humane and consistent with our principles and history. #KeepFamiliesTogetherI voted against this bill because it would have accepted @POTUS’ harsh anti-immigration policies. https://t.co/rISO89UuONPresident Trump's cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reuniting them. Even worse, they deported some moms and dads before they were able to recover their children. This can't stand! We must #KeepFamiliesTogether!@RepJohnFaso Thank you, @VaHsgAlliance for supporting this legislation to protect children from lead poisoning!We can help protect children from dangerous lead exposure. #HealthyHomes https://t.co/wpjBdm554IWhile lead poisoning in children has diminished, regulations as they stand do not adequately prevent contact with lead and its serious detrimental health impacts. Low-income families need proactive solutions to eradicate lead. #HealthyHomesToday, I introduced the #bipartisan, #bicameral Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act of 2018 with @RepJohnFaso. https://t.co/czIRkNOhuHWhile the Supreme Court has said it’s constitutional, that doesn’t make it right. I will continue to oppose such discriminatory policies. #MuslimBanI am disappointed with #SCOTUS' decision today. The America I know &amp; love doesn’t ban people because of their religion or their country of origin. https://t.co/dMZuTI7Ok3#DidYouKnow that on June 25, 1788, Virginia ratified the U.S. Constitution and officially entered the United States as the 10th state!

Holder. I urge Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.Officials have yet to issue a plan to reunite children with parents. This is abhorrent. Children, mothers and fathers seeking asylum must be reunited. https://t.co/7sJksDSPnFI cosponsored the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act because in the absence of presidential leadership, my colleagues and I have demonstrated that we are determined to stop these abhorrent and immoral practices and keep families together. https://t.co/6uecCG1DZYPresident Trump's cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reuniting them.

That’s why I spoke on the House floor tonight in support of #LWCF, America’s best parks program. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/x70RLfCQ3fI proudly cosponsored H.R. 502, Ranking Member @RepRaulGrijalva's legislation to permanently reauthorize #LWCF.Failure to save the #LWCF will have terrible consequences for the places we love. We have 100 days before the this critical legislation expires.This evening, I will join my @SEEC colleagues in our fight to #SaveLWCF because I believe that our parks and historical sites are worth protecting. You can watch us #LIVE on the House floor here: https://t.co/JFoH7Zt0eYWe must ensure that our constituents have affordable energy. There is a right way and a wrong way to do that.
✅The right way: Invest in green technology, emphasize renewables, &amp; work towards greater energy efficiency.
❌The wrong way: Increasing production of dirty fossil fuels.My amendment aims to help shine a light on how so-called "energy dominance" supporters prioritize corporate profits over American families and our communities' needs.I offered an amendment to H.R. 6088 for today's @NRDems markup requiring  operators to articulate the impacts of steel tariffs and crude oil exports on the price of oil.We must send a strong message that the U.S. will not abandon our world’s most vulnerable. #WorldRefugeeDay #WithRefugees#Refugees travel somewhere they have no home, no friends, and no resources to try and find safety.

This must stop and, if the president will not, then Congress simply must. #FamiliesBelongTogetherI am horrified and disappointed that we would separate children from parents at border crossings, and then house them far from family and homes. These children are innocent. #FamiliesBelongTogetherHappy 143rd birthday to the @USArmy!

A few moments of unease is worth it for a healthy long life.On the court, Marshall was a strong supporter of civil rights, constitutional protection of individual  rights and opposition to the death penalty. His legacy as a civil rights pioneer reminds us that the work is not done and that we must continue to stand up for what's right.#OTD in 1976, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court.

Their willingness to stand up to bigotry and hatred changed our world.In the ensuing two years since the #Pulse shooting, we have had hundreds of mass shootings with significant loss of life.

Protecting our oceans is protecting life itself.Happy #WorldOceanDay! Our oceans are the reason the earth can support life. Absorbing carbon and creating oxygen, they make our earth inhabitable. Moreover, they produce food and transportation for citizens around the world.55 years ago, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law. Though we celebrate the progress made in reducing the pay gap, there is much more work to be done. #EqualPay #EqualPayActGender identity has nothing to do with one’s ability to serve our country.

I pray for his family and friends as they mourn the loss of a great man. https://t.co/r0NeraV3JaThank you, to members of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations for meeting with my staff to discuss our shared priorities and concerns. #MuslimHillDay https://t.co/kJmVDUn6SjI’m joining faith leaders to urge my colleagues to protect SNAP for the most vulnerable Americans. #ProtectSNAP https://t.co/1BKXgT9LLUThank you, @GovernorVA Northam, for understanding what the EPA should be doing and for protecting Virginians! https://t.co/dC8UBTzyUT #CoalAshI very much appreciate the Advisory Committee informing me about what they need, and for their service to our community. I look forward to our next meeting.I provided the members with a legislative update, and we were able to discuss our community’s needs for the 2018 Farm Bill. I appreciate every opportunity to have an open dialogue about the issues that face my constituents. #VA04Thank you to members of the agricultural community who attended the  inaugural meeting of the 4th Congressional District's Agricultural Advisory Committee. #VA04 https://t.co/nXvrE926YGToday on #WorldAsthmaDay, we must take action to protect our family’s health, and I believe the Healthy Environment for Children Act is a great start. https://t.co/htppXL1vZD∙ @EPAScottPruitt’s constant assault on science-based research and efforts to protect children’s health is beyond worrisome.Unfortunately, millions of children – and adults – suffer from this lung disease caused by #environmental factors like air pollution. #WorldAsthmaDayAs @EPAScottPruitt’s scandals pile up and support for his #dirtyenergy agenda wanes, Pruitt’s top aides are fleeing the agency. It’s time for #PollutingPruitt to follow them out the door. https://t.co/92CdrWCG35Another top #pollutingpruitt aide just resigned. https://t.co/tYpPqUfwp7#ICYMI Earlier today I joined @DefendOurFuture for a Twitter Chat on #climatechange, #environmentaljustice, #Parisclimateagreement, the #EPAbudget, and more. ⚡️https://t.co/8xeea1P4SGThank you for having me, @DefendOurFuture! https://t.co/GMoEFSnxmQA8: Your voice matters and you can make a difference in shaping your future.A8: It’s important that elected leaders hear from you. Ask questions; demand answers. I encourage you to call and write your representatives. Let them know what matters to you. I read my constituent mail and it better informs how I cast my votes and the legislation I draft. https://t.co/bjeG44QUTxA7: Working together, we can ensure that we leave a better world for future generations. #ActOnClimateA7: That is why one of my first actions in Congress was co-founding the #UnitedforClimate and #EnvironmentalJustice task force. https://t.co/TloA1T8spiA7: I also believe it is our responsibility to protect those who are disproportionately impacted by climate change and pollution. We’ve got to do more to protect communities of color and low-income communities.A7: During my time at Virginia Union University earning my Master of Divinity, I was introduced to Creation Care - a belief that calls for protecting the Earth. As a man of faith, I believe that it is our responsibility to protect God’s gift.A7: As an Eagle Scout, I’ve always maintained that we should ‘leave the campground better than you found it,’ to quote an old saying. https://t.co/6RIueBvIePA6. Local and state action to address climate change is more important than ever when we have an administration that refuses to act to protect our communities. #ActOnClimateA6: That’s right. One of the many entities filling this void of U.S. leadership is the @USClimate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors who have committed their states to achieving emissions reductions goals set by the Paris agreement. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/uopwKoKxchA5: I wholeheartedly believe that the #environment is the issue of the 21st century. We have to get this right.A5: Instead of leading on this issue, the president is essentially ceding our leadership role in combating one of the great challenges of our time.A5: The decision was disappointing, to say the least. I believe the  United States has a moral obligation to address climate change. Our  actions today will impact public health now and for future generations. https://t.co/ssjG7PLCM7A4: It was clear at the listening sessions around the country that Americans overwhelmingly support the Clean Power Plan. The administration ought to listen to the millions of Americans who spoke out in favor of the CPP. #ProtectCPPA4: The Clean Power Plan is a public health protection. Not only will it help to clean the air we breathe, but it will also put us on the path toward a cleaner and more prosperous future for all. #ProtectCPP https://t.co/FKHabNspXfA3: I have and will continue to work against this administration’s efforts on this issue every step of the way. I questioned BOEM at their field hearing in Richmond, because Virginians know that offshore drilling is not worth the risk. https://t.co/YFwwbKDRYgA3: Opening our coastlines to offshore drilling could result in oil spills that would devastate the environment and threaten the lifestyle and economies of our coastal communities. https://t.co/uHTpdbjJr1A2: To be blunt: @EPAScottPruitt has failed the American people. He must vacate his office immediately, and that’s why I joined @RepKCastor and @SenatorTomUdall and more than 180 members of Congress in calling for Pruitt’s resignation. #BootPruittA2: Pruitt has consistently advocated on behalf of corporate polluters and not the American people. Pruitt’s actions – the gross misuse of taxpayer dollars aside – demonstrate that he’s unfit to lead this agency. #BootPruittA2: The @EPA’s mission is to protect human health and the #environment. Mr. Pruitt disregards the EPA’s promise to the American people. https://t.co/jUgTbJYANfAt a time when our communities – including constituents in the fighting #VA04 – strive to protect their future, our government should fund &amp; prioritize protections that address pollution. That’s why my colleagues and I called for more funding for @EPA’s FY19 budget.The plan slashes EPA’s budget by $2.8 billion. This includes a 70% cut to #environmentaljustice enforcement; elimination of grants to fight lead poisoning; and reductions to state, local and tribal air quality monitoring programs.The plan demonstrates that the administration does not prioritize the health and safety of our communities – particularly communities of color, low-income families, and other marginalized groups.A1: The president’s budget plan concerns us for a number of reasons. https://t.co/zfzTarUS02Thank you for having me, @DefendOurFuture. It’s my pleasure to join you for this important conversation. https://t.co/OcVY1PmKto#HappeningSoon: My Twitter chat with @DefendOurFuture! https://t.co/SUy9oXVZEjToday at 1pm EST, I will join @DefendOurFuture for a Twitter chat about #climatechange, #environmentaljustice, #PollutingPruitt, the Paris Climate Agreement, and more!I hope this bill will create lasting state-federal partnerships to preserve lands and improve water quality; I specifically hope that it will encourage states to set up new conservation easement programs.I introduced the Clean Water Partnership Act (CWPA) in part to encourage every state to use a program similar to Virginia’s for the specific purpose of improving water quality. https://t.co/qYxjwI8WToVirginia landowners already have the ability, with our land preservation tax credit, to receive transferable tax credits when they accept conservation easements that prevent their land from being developed (or when they convey that land outright to a public or private preserver).The need to prioritize our water quality means that each level of government must work cohesively with the members of our community to ensure that we have clean water available everywhere.In my recent @RTDOpinions op-ed I highlight the importance of prioritizing water quality in our communities with the Clean Water Partnership Act. https://t.co/DVw2fuOHHHThe Flint Water Crisis reminds us, every individual needs and deserves access to clean water.We’re all incredibly proud of @cannnon25! #VSUExcellence #VA04 https://t.co/hmXJqV1HPuI’m looking forward to joining @DefendOurFuture for a Twitter chat on #climatechange, #environmentaljustice, the Paris climate agreement, Scott Pruitt and more. We’ll see you here on Twitter, Monday at 1pm EST!Today, 147 of my colleagues and I sent a letter to @SpeakerRyan requesting an explanation because this abrupt dismissal is incredibly baffling. https://t.co/0PgQptUGvFI am opposed to this proposal and will fight to keep @HUDgov fair and just.About 712,000 households who receive federal housing subsidies would see their monthly  rents rise from $50 to $150. This increase will not work for individuals in my district who have been forced to reside in unimaginable conditions.Coming on the heels of tax breaks to wealthy Americans and corporations, 
@HUDgov @SecretaryCarson is proposed tripling the rent for our most vulnerable citizens.One year ago, @realDonaldTrump signed executive orders to rollback protections on monuments. This is an attack on America's public lands and an obvious attempt to turn these lands over to oil and gas. I will fight to protect our access to public lands.This is NOT the way to lead the @EPA. #BootPruitt 🌎 https://t.co/VB6Jqn9uAfIn advance of @EPAScottPruitt’s hearing, I firmly stand with my colleagues in opposition to his proposed cuts to the EPA.It is unfortunate that instead of helping communities in need, @realDonaldTrump and @EPAScottPruitt intend to cut programs aimed at curbing environmental injustice.For this exact reason and others, I proudly led 60+ of my colleagues to urge fully funding the EPA by @NitaLowey and @USRepRodney. https://t.co/T9UTRfNZ61Sadly, the EPA budget cuts proposed by @realDonaldTrump and @EPAScottPruitt would hurt communities of color the MOST.#FACT: Toxic waste and pollution have plagued marginalized communities causing serious health concerns for far too long and action is necessary, not just empty rhetoric.I would just remind Mike Pompeo, our new Secretary of State, that diplomacy is better than war, that we want to be engaged with the world and that we stand for equality for all, including our Muslim brothers and sisters and our LGBTQ citizens. https://t.co/VhM5jp7FiCThe @EPA has been entangled with secrecy, waste of taxpayer $ and widespread conflicts of interest thanks to @EPAScottPruitt’s unethical actions putting the health and safety of all Americans at risk. #BootPruittI call on Mr. Pruitt to resign because Americans cannot and should not be the victim of his abuse of power.The American people have lost faith in the @EPA as a result of #PollutingPruitt and enough is enough which is why I am supporting a resolution that calls for his immediate resignation.Furthermore, it is obvious that #PollutingPruitt is a disgrace to the @EPA.; He has one job. He’s failed it.The number of independent federal investigations @EPAScottPruitt is currently under continue to pile up and he needs to be held accountable for his failures at the @EPA. #BootPruittAttempting to use his security detail’s sirens to circumvent DC traffic is just another example of unethical action #PollutingPruitt has taken..@EPAScottPruitt continues to dig himself into ethical holes by handing out large pay raises to his friends and passing the blame to his subordinates once under scrutiny..@EPAScottPruitt’s attempts to waste taxpayer dollars and bend rules are so far reaching that EPA employees who voiced concerns were systematically silenced. #BootPruitt#PollutingPruitt rolled back fuel efficiency standards resulting in increased costs to Americans both at the gas pump and in the doctor’s office.Public health and a sustainable future are at stake while Mr. Pruitt disregards the EPA’s promise to the American people to protect human health and the environment. #BootPruittPresident @EmmanuelMacron stood in front of Congress extolling the same type of values that are on the French gift to the US, the Statue of Liberty. Ironically, this happened the same day President Trump destroys Lady Liberty's values by arguing for a Muslim ban in court. https://t.co/TJvWdNB7IpI’m honored to keynote @ChildFund’s global advocacy summit to help mark their 80th year of protecting children in the US and around the world. Thank you for all you do! https://t.co/OfXOVtMAc2I could not agree more with President @EmmanuelMacron’s statement about the United States rejoining the #ParisClimateAgreement. https://t.co/OB7OMuwQlV 🌎This is another document in the overwhelmingly tall pile of evidence that proves how much we need to reduce the prevalence of these practices in our nation’s schools.Instead of rolling back critical civil rights protections, such as the Obama-era 2014 School Discipline Guidance, the Trump Administration should listen to the message delivered in this report.The continuous pattern of disparate student discipline warrants action.This data confirms what we already knew: children of color and children with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined and arrested compared to their white and non-disabled peers in our public schools across the country. https://t.co/RwDEOZcGICDecisions should be based on the best research available, not limited because Mr. Pruitt and his allies really only want to hear from anti-environmental lobbyists in making decisions.The goal of the @EPA should be to ensure the healthiest environment. Limiting science &amp; research is obviously a step backwards from that goal. https://t.co/H97zljhN1aOutstanding News. https://t.co/r8oQTTckAB#CourtsMatter too much to confirm Stuart Kyle Duncan.Stuart Kyle Duncan has spent a significant portion of his career denying equality to minorities and members of the LGBT community. It's beyond time to #StopDuncan.Last month I urged Senate leadership to reject this nomination to our courts. #ProtectOurCourts #StopDuncan https://t.co/xKBdlt58GBThe Senate must prevent the continued attacks on our freedoms. #StopDuncanSeveral of @realDonaldTrump's judicial nominees – like Stuart Kyle Duncan – have a history of attempting to hinder progress in establishing equal rights for all.A fair and impartial judiciary is essential to the stability and success of our democracy. For our system to retain the confidence of the people, judges must be impartial, both in substance and appearance, and maintain a commitment to the dignity of all Americans. #StopDuncanUtilities must continue to test the water near their toxic #coalash dumps to make sure hazardous chemicals don't leak into drinking water. #ProtectCleanWaterChildren &amp; older individuals are especially vulnerable to #coalash exposure. 1.5+ million children live near #coalash storage sites &amp; 70% of them disproportionately impact low-income communities.If we leave polluters unchecked, or if we fail to regulate the waste they produce appropriately, many of us may live shorter and less healthy lives.Recently I traveled with VA Natural Resources Sec. Matt Strickler, and representatives from both the @JRAvirginia &amp; @VirginiaLCV to discuss the adverse effects of #coalash pits near the James River in my district. https://t.co/dnL1WYFi9mHis proposed rescission would result in millions of tons of toxic pollutants being released into the air.I joined 100+ of my colleagues in urging @SecretaryZinke to reconsider the damaging changes he proposed to the BLM’s Methane Waste Prevention Rule. https://t.co/eSH2sBy2Xz. @SecretaryZinke and his corrupt company of polluters continue to put communities at greater risk by trying to rollback thoughtful rules and regulations written to protect us.We must protect necessary waste prevention regulations to keep dangerous emissions from polluting our air. That is why I participated in the BLM comment period. #CutMethaneThe deadline for the Congressional Art Competition 2018 is approaching! You or a student you know can submit artwork until this Friday, April 27th. https://t.co/Jvl7YK5cXh https://t.co/BLIZH7dTio#EarthDay https://t.co/GubRgKOsejHere’s my official #EarthDay statement ➡️ https://t.co/2OaZCDGViYI remain committed to fighting for clean energy, innovative green collar jobs, and progressive policies that will power our country forward and protect the one planet we have to give to our children and our children’s children. #EarthDayI co-founded the #UnitedforClimate and #EnvironmentalJustice task force with @RepBarragan &amp; @RepJayapal to build a coalition of advocates in Congress who will fight for the solutions we need now. #EarthDayCongressional Republicans and the Trump Administration must realize that now is the time for progress – not rollbacks. #EarthDayWe have more than enough proof to know that the #environment is the issue of the 21st Century. #EarthDay https://t.co/2OaZCDGViYTime is running out as we fight to mitigate the harmful impacts of #climatechange, such as the deteriorating Great Barrier reefs, the melting ice caps, and the sea-level rise we experience in my district. #EarthDayWe must fight every day against the steady attacks on environmental progress.#EarthDay reminds us of the importance to preserve our planet, and to accomplish our shared goal of ensuring that every individual has access to clean air, water, and land.The #DeepwaterDisaster taught us that offshore drilling is not worth the risk. #ProtectOurCoastIt is unconscionable that the president would even consider expanded offshore drilling after the #DeepwaterDisaster.Actively choosing to engage in destructive offshore-oil-drilling practices jeopardizes the well-being of our coastal communities.25+ oil spills in the United States alone since the #DeepwaterDisaster in 2010 is one too many.Since taking office, @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryZinke has prioritized expanding offshore-oil-drilling and weakening safety regulations that protect our natural resources. These choices threaten public health and our water quality.The #DeepwaterDisaster oil spill taught us an unforgettable lesson. We cannot go backward. #ProtectOurCoastEight years later, we see the Trump Administration trying to open more of our oceans to offshore drilling solely to please #dirtyenergy business owners.In the six long months it took to control the spill, 5 million barrels of crude oil was dumped into the Gulf of Mexico - damaging the local economy and the ecosystem.Eight years ago today, we witnessed one of history's worst environmental disasters: the #DeepwaterDisaster oil spill.
