Celebrating #Armenia at the @smithsonian #2018Folklife Festival w/ George Aghjayan from Worcester &amp; #Massachusetts youth leader Nairi Khachatourian! üá¶üá≤üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/WaKNc2vtegReading the heartbreaking stories from @capgaznews shooting -- my heart goes out to all those whose lives have been changed forever by another senseless act of gun violence. https://t.co/Ru8G3E8kVt2/ @HouseDemocrats will continue to fight alongside unions for better wages, better conditions, better benefits &amp; better jobs for the American people and NO court case can stop that. #UnionStrong #Solidarity1/ With #Janus decision, #SCOTUS turned its back on the firefighters, teachers, police officers &amp; public servants who keep communities across America safe &amp; strong. https://t.co/mwmd6jdLFhToday's decision in #TrumpvHawaii is a sad &amp; shameful moment for our country. History will judge harshly those who erode America's values by undermining religious freedom. https://t.co/z6bNvBQbMMSaddened to hear of the passing of Kathy Shaw. She was a friend &amp; great reporter for @telegramdotcom who showed us all how one person can make a difference. https://t.co/DwO7gcgMd2Only @realDonaldTrump could drive an American icon like @harleydavidson overseas. His #TradeWar &amp; #GOPtaxScam are quickly being recognized as a massive failure for our country. https://t.co/ekjaloTMPyI voted against creating @DHSgov &amp; @ICEgov because I feared they could be used as a political tool to traumatize innocent immigrant communities &amp; rip families apart. @realDonaldTrump has confirmed my worst fears. It's time to #AbolishICE. https://t.co/qXTG4hGLAQUnder @realDonaldTrump's direction, @ICEgov has completely lost legitimacy ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to start from scratch. My full statement: https://t.co/kgqPxoKeBgMLK said, ‚ÄúLet no man pull you low enough to hate him.‚Äù
 
We must fight for truth and goodness as we defend our values, and we cannot lose our own kindness and civility in the process.2/ In our nation of abundance, millions of children &amp; adults still struggle with hunger. Reducing food waste plays a crucial role in bridging this gap so we can #EndHungerNow. https://t.co/uHFtfc7mEa1/ Thank you @drsanjaygupta for shining a light on #foodwaste in America. American consumers, businesses &amp; farms spend nearly $218 billion per year growing, processing, transporting &amp; disposing of food that's never eaten.Sign up for my newsletter at https://t.co/TEmTEPL1zw to learn when I'll be hosting coffee in your neighborhood!So grateful for the warm welcome &amp; for everyone who came out at 8AM on a Saturday for Coffee with your Congressman in #OrangeMA!

Details here ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/JNLgHLiDBJDear @SpeakerRyan: want to know what Americans have #ZeroTolerance for? The hatred &amp; bigotry that you &amp; @realDonaldTrump are using to push your shameful anti-immigrant agenda. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/cE888rNgMWWe brought some photos so he could see the faces of the children who are being needlessly traumatized by his evil policy. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/nu1khZkmlv.@realDonaldTrump didn‚Äôt want to talk with @HouseDemocrats because he can‚Äôt defend his cruel, heartless policy of family separation. https://t.co/M032JPJJGGüé• via @TEDTalks: learn more about Dr. Li‚Äôs #FoodIsMedicine work to prevent cancer https://t.co/iATgDx09s5Thanks to The Edge of @U2 and Dr. William Li of @angio_org for speaking to our bipartisan #FoodIsMedicine working group about angiogenesis &amp; the importance of food as medicine! https://t.co/dPJtWzajpk.@SecNielsen should resign immediately. She continues to shamelessly implement a policy of pure evil ‚Äî and lied directly to the American people yesterday in order to use children as a bargaining chip.

RT if you agree: it‚Äôs time for @SecNielsen to step down.Thank you former First Lady @laurawbush for speaking up on behalf of parents and children, and speaking out against the cruel, un-American @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse policy of family separation. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/x0zRWP7piWI wish President @IvanDuque of #Colombia every success in bringing peace &amp; prosperity to all Colombians, and in implementing fully the peace accords that ended over a half-century of internal conflict. #ColombiaElige2018 #ColombiaElige https://t.co/izn8JSpUGNICYMI: Last month 73 @HouseDemocrats urged @StateDept to stand up for #HumanRights in #Colombia ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/4cfbEM0M7sIn NYC on #FathersDay ‚Äî met a fellow dad in front of Trump Tower protesting @WhiteHouse policy of separating kids from their parents.¬†Dads &amp; moms understand this policy is wrong. I wish @realDonaldTrump would listen. https://t.co/Mzs0oui8fXHappy #FathersDay! Wishing all dads a wonderful &amp; relaxing day with your loved ones. https://t.co/2DbpnRu5c9We cannot let this be the face of America. @realDonaldTrump ‚Äî please stop it now! #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/PCDKvQuMDlSomeone should remind Rudy that no President is above the law. His outrageously corrupt &amp; unethical suggestion should outrage all Americans who care about the rule of law. https://t.co/kfCnDBvH4g.@realDonaldTrump continues to lie about family separation. There is NO law requiring families seeking asylum to be ripped apart. Family separation is a direct result of the cruel &amp; heartless policies of his administration. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/FV5usoChhZ.@realDonaldTrump there's something wrong with you. https://t.co/bkbbSb4aSkSad to hear of the passing of my friend from #Northampton, Arky Markham. A true fighter for justice &amp; peace, she made our community &amp; our world a better place. https://t.co/YE5ZrMcbjAEveryone in America should have a place to call home. I'm proud to recognize @TCBCommunities for all they have done to make that a reality by revitalizing neighborhoods &amp; expanding affordable housing opportunities throughout #Massachusetts. https://t.co/ga1uCu1YzfIt is unconscionable that the United States is literally tearing families apart at the border. The majority of people in America do not support this and we will not tolerate such acts of inhumanity from @realDonaldTrump. #KeepFamiliesTogether #StopSeparatingFamilies https://t.co/QJRKUahnboThose fleeing gang violence often face forced recruitment, sexual slavery, and even death if their children are not handed over to violent criminal gangs. @TheJusticeDept shutting them out goes against everything this country stands for.Yet another act of heartless cruelty from the @realDonaldTrump administration against vulnerable children and families fleeing terror and violence. https://t.co/QF3SMldUnVDespite overwhelming public support for #NetNeutrality, @realDonaldTrump's repeal goes into effect today. Consumers ‚Äî not big corporations ‚Äî should decide what apps &amp; websites we see online. Proud to sign my name &amp; force a vote to #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/PP5EFSheIgWith all the pessimism in our politics, it was so uplifting to see students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High perform at the #TonyAwards. We should all be inspired by their courage &amp; persistence in speaking out for what they believe in! https://t.co/ZoQ0551GUd #EndGunViolenceTruly beyond belief. @realDonaldTrump continues to defend Putin &amp; advocate for Russia instead of defending our allies &amp; advocating for the American people. #G7 #G7Summit2018 https://t.co/2kyhH4SQvtSign up for my newsletter at https://t.co/TEmTEPL1zw to learn when office hours are coming to your neighborhood. #Massachusetts #MApoli #centralMAThanks to everyone who came to Coffee with your Congressman in #Grafton, #Webster, and #Uxbridge today!

Thanks to the teachers and parents who made it possible. https://t.co/zMmO9mHS9DAmerica‚Äôs strength comes from our commitment to always protecting our fundamental rights like freedom of speech. @NFL targeting players who exercise that basic right by protesting against inequality in this country is just plain wrong. https://t.co/QaqWG4kQWtBIG NEWS: House passed my #bipartisan amendment to honor 225,000+ American #veterans who put their lives on line in #nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1966.

America must protect human rights. We can't with CIA led by torturer. RT to say we must #BlockHaspel https://t.co/bFPbnfrJFo#FoodIsMedicine is more than an expression.

Must read: https://t.co/wLm6HOtCvn https://t.co/MktOqw43RjWow: @realDonaldTrump will only sign #2018FarmBill if it has extreme cuts to #SNAP assistance that helps millions of Americans put food on table. This will only make #hunger worse.

https://t.co/Vl2nehht0xThis is outrageous: Trump admin was warned in U.S. embassy cables from @StateDept diplomats that expelling 300,000 Central Americans and Haitians could be dangerous. But they did it anyway. Absolutely shameful.

https://t.co/z3eecuheUE@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP .@HouseGOP pushing #Trump style loyalty pledge for any Member of Congress - Democrat or Republican - before they can make amendment to #2018FarmBill is a new low even for #GOPClosedCongress. Americans need a Congress where all voices are heard. Our letter: https://t.co/mlpJjiMcug https://t.co/AcG1k1dbpo.@SpeakerRyan promised a fair and open Congress when he took the gavel.

https://t.co/tDbIwcNwNZ@mike_pence @NRA @GOP NEW REPORT: In America today, more kids are dying from #GunViolence than car accidents. Let that sink in. Today more kids die from guns than car accidents. https://t.co/YykUb4pJYE 

@realDonaldTrump won't mention this at #NRAAM2018, but we can. RT to say we need #GunReformNow. https://t.co/GOWEuB38d0Wow: @Mike_Pence, is one of most pro-gun politicians, but at his @NRA speech today, guns will be banned.

@GOP says we should have guns in schools, but when it's their safety, guns are suddenly a bad idea. Putting themselves ahead of kids is just shameful. https://t.co/1h64TDvr2h@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @WhiteHouse This week I warned @WorcCountyBar the #RuleOfLaw is under attack from @realDonaldTrump and @WhiteHouse. Now #Giuliani is actually pushing the Attorney General to interfere in #Cohen probe. 

This is exactly what I meant.

@HouseGOP‚Äôs blatant failure to hold him and @WhiteHouse accountable for their lies is absolutely shameful.

https://t.co/KrlVrVqXThThis is outrageous: Rudy Giuliani seems to confirm @realDonaldTrump  is guilty of campaign finance law violation in attempt to hide the facts from the American people.

RT to say @GOP attack on poor must end now https://t.co/bwjZ3nf9QRIf @HouseAgNews never intended for @HouseDemocrats to have a voice in #2018FarmBill and @HouseGOP always planned to use #FarmBill as a last-ditch effort to steamroll @SpeakerRyan's attack on poor families, then why hold 23 HEARINGS on #SNAP and it's efforts to fight #hunger? https://t.co/SV5f6CkTyI.@HouseAgNews held 23 hearings on #SNAP and I attended all of them.
