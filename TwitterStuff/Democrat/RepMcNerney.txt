Americans deserve to feel safe in their workplaces, classrooms, churches and other spaces where these heinous and avoidable acts of violence have occurred. Congress has a moral obligation to enact commonsense gun reforms now. 2/2Today our nation grieves for the lives lost at the hands of a gunman who was able to purchase a weapon legally, despite glaring warning signs that he should not have been allowed to do so. 1/2Today’s SCOTUS decision has dealt a major blow to public employees &amp; their ability to collectively bargain. Unions have fought for higher wages, better benefits, &amp; safer working conditions.  We must continue to fight for the principles that built the American middle-class.Three years ago, marriage equality became the law of the land, but there is still work to be done. The Equality Act would extend existing civil rights protections to #LGBTQ people, prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. #EqualityForwardAccess to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right. That's why I signed the discharge petition and will continue to fight to reverse the @FCC's disastrous repeal of #NetNeutrality protections. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/xXiiOIKnhOWomen have a right to accurate and unbiased information about their healthcare options. Today’s SCOTUS decision in #NIFLAvBecerra opens the door for misleading and inaccurate information to be given freely to women in need of health services. #EndTheLiesThe Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Trump’s travel ban is a direct contrast to the founding principles of our nation. This ruling is an endorsement of discriminatory policies of the past, and does not represent our values. #NoMuslimBanEverKicking off the second meeting of the Bipartisan #CampaignFinance Reform Caucus with @usapromise, @takebackorg and Fix it America. https://t.co/6eFBu70xjlMary and I had a great time at the Town of Discovery Bay’s 20th Anniversary Celebration this weekend.

Thanks to Mayor Sean Wright, Councilman Tony Tiscareno and City Manager Ron Bernal for stopping by my DC office. #NationalSelfieDay https://t.co/i8ocxW97cjSeparating children from their parents is cruel &amp; inhumane. That’s why I’m standing with my colleagues in support of H.R. 6135, the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. As a co-sponsor of this legislation, I’ll fight back against this heartbreaking policy until this abhorrent practice ends. https://t.co/tVUK4dB9KjI've heard from thousands of Californians about this issue, &amp; I'll continue to fight in Congress to repeal this backward policy shift. To follow the hearing on #SB822, tune in here: https://t.co/KzBjClrPde 2/2Strong #netneutrality protections are crucial to the free flow of ideas &amp; future economic growth. As the #California Assembly considers #SB822, I hope they’ll uphold the critical protections laid out in this legislation. 1/2#Juneteenth is more than a celebration of progress, it is a reminder of the continued work we must do to eradicate systemic racial injustices throughout our nation. We must continue to fight for equality and use our past as a guide for a better future for all Americans. https://t.co/9WviFfOq1cThere is no greater moral obligation that we have than to care for the children of this world. Tearing them from the arms of their parents is just despicable. I'll continue fighting to #keepfamiliestogether and put an end to this cruel and inhumane policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/z4qhGqCl8r@WhipHoyer @EnergyCommerce Thank you, my friend!This week I had the opportunity to talk to some bright young students from Bristow Middle School in Brentwood.

A great public servant, Bob’s been the Mayor of Brentwood throughout my time in Congress and I’ve enjoyed working with him over the years. https://t.co/jN0hvDuojgToday, the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect. Access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right and that's why I'll continue to fight for these critical protections.130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions are protected under the Affordable Care Act, but last night the Trump Administration announced that it would no longer defend these vital protections. #ProtetcOurCareI'm proud to be one of nearly 200 Members of Congress who joined @MyConstitution to demand that the President comply with the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause #NoOneAboveTheLaw

Every day Congress fails to enact commonsense gun reforms, it fails our children, our families, and our entire community. Americans deserve better than this. #EnoughIsEnoughI signed the discharge petition to force a vote to restore #NetNeutrality protections. The Senate has done their part, now it’s the House’s turn. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/KmdLOZqkq9An appropriations bill should not include a provision to eliminate judicial review.

This will likely hurt American consumers at the pump, alienate our allies, and make us less safe. This is another example of this administration’s disregard for our national security. #IranDealHousing and community development investments at HUD and USDA are critical to the success of our neighborhoods and communities. We should be building on last year's budget expansions for #affordablehousing, not making cuts to crucial programs. #CutsHurt #OurHomesOurVoicesEvery year the talent and passion of our high school students astounds me.

This is very disturbing as many of these actions will harm the people of this country, especially those who have little or no ability to defend themselves. #BootPruitt https://t.co/4Ks9ETvSXSI'll be questioning @EPAScottPruitt in just a few minutes. I'm concerned about his proposed cuts to essential programs &amp; some of the ethical controversies that have recently come to light. This is unacceptable &amp; it's time to #BootPruitt.

Many will carry with them the physical and invisible wounds of war for the rest of their lives. 3/While there are improvements to be made within the VA system, I am deeply disturbed by allegations that there is a concerted effort by this Administration to renege on that promise &amp; push millions of veterans out of a system specifically designed to address their unique needs. 2/Long ago, we made a commitment to our #veterans.

https://t.co/NbS1FTppIdand not the court of public opinion. The distribution of this document, which includes only select information presented in a partisan and misleading manner, reinforces that its intent is to undermine the ongoing investigations by Director Mueller and Congress. 2/2The memo released by the Majority on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is a blatant attempt to politicize our national intelligence.

New drilling along America’s Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts will lock us into decades of CO2 pollution. #ProtectOurCoast #ActOnClimateWishing everyone a safe and happy New Year! Throughout 2017, I had the privilege of working on legislation to address numerous pressing issues, and I'm hopeful that Congress can come together to accomplish more for the American people in this new year.Yesterday, I spoke out against the disastrous #GOPTaxScam. Americans know that this plan will hurt them and our economy, and they have made their voices heard. But Republicans have pushed this legislation through anyway. https://t.co/HWisAPco3iSince @HouseGOP rushed the process &amp; didn’t know what was in their own bill, the House had to vote again on the #GOPTaxScam. This is a disastrous bill that many Americans oppose because it cuts taxes for corporations &amp; the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. Shameful.For many states, the open enrollment period for 2018 ends at midnight tonight. You still have time to #GetCovered at https://t.co/hmJqJfnmls! https://t.co/rrtwrF6nGuThank you @MClyburnFCC for giving me the opportunity to submit my statement for the record. Today's decision is a dangerous step backwards, but the fight is not over. #NetNeutrality
https://t.co/vPzrR14v7m. @AjitPaiFCC denied my request to address the @FCC. He also denied my request, and the requests of members from both sides of the aisle, to speak with him before the #NetNeutrality vote tomorrow. Shutting out members of Congress is also shutting out the Americans we represent.A Republican #TaxBill that includes reckless drilling in the #ArcticRefuge is an unforgivable mistake. We must #ProtectTheArctic for future generations.Just sent a letter to @AjitPaiFCC, requesting to address the @FCC at Thursday's open meeting. #NetNeutrality is on the line, and I hope the Chairman will honor my request to speak before the Commission on behalf of all those who wish to maintain a free and #openinternet. https://t.co/nV13aTedPCSaddened to hear of the passing of #SF Mayor #EdLee.

We have to listen to those coming forward and prevent this from happening to others. All allegations must be taken seriously and there must be transparency and accountability.This #WorldAIDSDay, let's remember those we have lost to HIV/AIDS, and recommit to investments in medicine &amp; education to #EndAIDS2030.I’ve heard from thousands of constituents who are concerned about the elimination of #netneutrality and their online #privacy protections. It’s incredibly frustrating that Republicans in Congress and at the #FCC are not taking consumer protection seriously. https://t.co/f8GGasN6HAProtecting #Dreamers might be the most popular, bipartisan issue in America right now. Let's end the year in unity, and pass a bill for the hundreds of thousands of young people contributing in our communities.Wishing you and your family a very #HappyThanksgiving! Many of us will spend the day surrounded by loved ones, but many will also spend this day serving to protect our country. Today, and everyday, I'm thankful to those who sacrifice time with their families to keep ours safe.I will continue to fight for strong #netneutrality protections so that my constituents and all Americans can have access to a free and open internet. 3/They are vital for safeguarding free speech, which is essential for maintaining a robust democracy, and they are critical for fostering innovation. The Chairman’s proposal is flawed and misguided, and completely ignores the interests of consumers. 2/Yesterday, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission announced that in just a few weeks the Commission will vote on his proposal to eliminate #netneutrality protections. These protections are the core of a free and open internet. 1/My statement on the @HouseGOP #GOPTaxScam: https://t.co/mgMRdGuwlmTomorrow's @FCC vote will cut enrollment in Lifeline by 70%. We need #LifelineForAll to ensure all Americans receive affordable internet &amp; phone access.. @HouseGOP claims the #GOPTaxScam is a cut for the middle class, but it eliminates popular deductions that help millions of Americans - especially those in my district. I joined @UpfrontKPFA to discuss the bill.

We must #extendCHIP without cutting essential programs that our children need. https://t.co/y6HaAp0o00#SmallBusiness leaders don't support the @HouseGOP tax plan. We need to focus on ways to give small businesses and #entrepreneurs more opportunities to thrive. https://t.co/cwUMs5XEGzWith nearly 40% of taxpayers who make $50K-75K a year benefiting from the State &amp; Local Tax deduction, it's hard to understand why the @HouseGOP wants to eliminate it. This plan puts #BillionairesFirst.Businesses shouldn't be able to discriminate against you because of who you are or who you love. This isn't about cakes, just like it wasn't about water fountains.
