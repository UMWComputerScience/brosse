So much energy today at the #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch where people in Boston and all over the country are standing up and speaking out against @realDonaldTrump inhumane family separation policy. https://t.co/0JAt5CKt1zIn my latest newsletter, I discuss troubling news from #SCOTUS; immigration and the crisis at the border; defense funding; and legislation meant only to discredit the #Mueller investigation. And as always, I update my #BehindTheCurtain feature. https://t.co/viMP658sC8Congratulations to the talented Rubiyah Isa, a student at Boston Latin, for winning the 7th CD’s Congressional Art Competition with her stunning self portrait titled: School's Out, Summer's In. https://t.co/09oPIrzg2uThanks to @lawyer_moms for meeting with me to share their concerns about children being separated from their parents at the border. I appreciate your activism on this important issue. https://t.co/v6xelzIpqQI’m participating in tomorrow’s National Day of Action to Keep Families Together, hope you can join us in Boston!Keeping the Capital Gazette family in my heart and grieving for this senseless loss of life. Journalists help all of us better understand the world around us and it sickens me that a newsroom became a place of violence.It’s the 6th anniv of Supreme Court decision upholding healthcare bill, @realDonaldTrump and Republicans are still searching for ways to undermine it.This month DOJ declined to defend provisions protecting those with preexisting conditions. More than 1/2 of women/girls have them.Candidate Trump insisted that confirming a Supreme Court justice nine months before an election robbed the people of their voice. Surely the voice of the people is as important today as it was during the last court vacancy.The impact of Justice Kennedy’s retirement will reverberate for generations with so much at stake, from reproductive freedom to employee rights and protection against discrimination.Sharing with you more details about my trip to the Texas border. I am more determined than ever to fight for the reunification of every family. https://t.co/K7QcfJnZqsI disagree vehemently with today’s SCOTUS ruling on public unions. It ignores 40+ yrs of precedent to attack rights of public employees, like teachers, firefighters, and police.  Justice Kagan is right, 1st Amend was not meant to undermine, but to protect democratic governance.I recently spoke about my experience visiting the border and was joined by some of my colleagues who were on the trip.  I call on all Americans to stand up to the Trump administration on this issue. https://t.co/RnhiQXauxpToday’s Supreme Court decision upholding @realDonaldTrump Muslim Ban is outrageous. His own words reveal exactly Trump’s intent  – to prevent Muslims from coming to the U.S. This ruling doesn’t change the fact that the ban is discriminatory and against what America was founded onIt may have required more than 1 formal groundbreaking but we are well on our way to bringing the Green Line Extension to commuters. I appreciate the hard work of our federal, state and local partners &amp; look forward to celebrating the new station openings! https://t.co/HMY9knOXPCLet's be clear, yesterday's Supreme Court decision in Abbott v. Perez on Texas congressional map undermines the Voting Rights Act. It makes it easier for states to get away with racial gerrymandering which dilutes the voices of minority voters.The latest “proposal” from @realDonaldTrump on immigration seeks to abolish due process for asylum-seekers. It’s outrageous, constitutionally dubious and doesn't solve the urgent problem of reuniting traumatized children with their families. That’s where the focus must be.It’s a beautiful morning in Somerville as we announce $225 million in federal funds for the Green Line Extension and applaud the next phase of the project. https://t.co/DAQWw9SUZ2Too many people are not being told what’s happening to their children. This is unacceptable and immoral. https://t.co/fuzc4aulwIWhat I saw in Texas broke my heart. There is no sign that the Trump administration has a credible plan for reuniting families. This must be a priority. @realDonaldTrump - you created this problem and you must fix it. https://t.co/P5ueHu8cwJChildren being brought to this country and torn from their families will suffer a lifetime of consequences. It is imperative that we keep up the pressure on @realDonaldTrump to reunite them with their parents. https://t.co/5wqA4ah0C9I'm in Texas because I thought it important to carry the message of my constituents who demand that @realDonaldTrump be held accountable. I'm not convinced he understands or cares what it will take to right this wrong. I won't stop fighting until every family is reunited.Next stop - the Border Security Station in McAllen, Texas - expressing my very serious concerns and asking pointed questions about how families ripped apart because of @realDonaldTrump inhumane separation policy will be reunited.Started our fact finding mission at the Centralized Processing Center in Texas, demanding more information about what has been done to families and how officials are working to reunite them #FamiliesBelongTogetherIn my latest newsletter: Traveling to the U.S.-Mexico Border; Two Very Bad Immigration Bills; Waivers for States; Privacy Regulations; Gutting Nutrition Assistance; Expanding Access to Treatment for Substance Use Disorder; "Behind the Curtain" additions https://t.co/RDVca2HpJhThe @realDonaldTrump administration has a moral obligation to reunite the children with their parents. I joined 122 #Democrats demanding an investigation into how @DHSgov and @HHSgov are managing the records of these immigrant families so they can be reunited. https://t.co/Dsk08lv8v2I’ll be in Texas tomorrow at the U.S.-Mexico border to review Trump’s inhumane family separation policy. I will report back on what I see.And in the middle of the immigration debate with Republicans pushing a bill to keep families in detention and fund the wall, they also snuck in a vote cutting the food stamp program by $20 billion. It is hard to believe how little they care about families in need. What a week...The immigration bills the House is considering are appallingly bad. There's no compromise, in fact, quite the opposite. Republicans even propose turning away 3 million people with citizenship petitions already approved and make the family separation crisis worse https://t.co/GYUQLEiHbiStanding with my colleagues @HouseDemocrats on the steps of the Capitol demanding that the @realDonaldTrump administration end this immoral and cruel family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/nghugozMPAI stand with 190 @HouseDemocrats sponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. If @realDonaldTrump won’t end this immoral policy of tearing families apart at the border, a policy HE started, then we must find a way around him. https://t.co/qa72r56oyiWhat kind of immigration policy tears babies from the arms of their mothers @realDonaldTrump? Your actions are actively cruel and vindictive. You can make as many excuses as you want but our voices will only get louder https://t.co/EqycllyhMZRipping children from the arms of their parents is not a partisan issue. Every first lady has spoken out against this abhorrent and immoral policy.
https://t.co/wSeSdDYiT7Trump is doing substantial and lasting damage to these innocent children just to show he is tough on immigration. The stories pouring out from these detention facilities are heartbreaking and should outrage all of us.There are near 12,000 children separated from their families right now.  810 were separated from their families at the border in the last 4 days alone. Make no mistake, this is a deliberate and new policy.President Trump and his administration continue to bluster and lie about the unconscionable and cruel directive to rip children from their families at the border. This is not the law, as he falsely claims, it is child abuse.Congratulations and thanks @MuseumofScience for investing in 15 years of Engineering Education. https://t.co/pweJbx3wnXIn my latest newsletter: Discrimination; A Cruel and Vindictive Policy; Constituent Services; Singapore Summit; Reducing Illegal Drug Shipments; Misdirection of the Housing Vouchers; Reclassifying Drugs but Leaving Science Behind; #BehindtheCurtain feature https://t.co/sOnzo1pFSVComptroller Otting, the first step in reforming the Community Reinvestment Act: stop giving banks the OK to discriminate. 
https://t.co/gN8w9mgwnv @USOCCSo, @USOCC Comptroller Otting, please read this https://t.co/p4HqLLLxWQThe man who says he’s never seen discrimination in America is @realDonaldTrump’s new bank regulator Joe Otting. Problem is it’s Joe’s job to make sure banks don’t discriminate against minorities. #OCCnoColorSo @realDonaldTrump’s man in charge of making sure banks don’t discriminate against minorities told me he couldn’t say if discrimination exists in America because he’s never seen it. https://t.co/LxMVjziU91The point of the Disaster Housing Assistance Program is to provide affordable housing for natural disaster victims.  When will FEMA start this process for Puerto Rico residents?  It did for Katrina, Sandy and Rita victims.  My colleagues and I want answers https://t.co/DNKC27VX4WThis report shows all that is wrong with @realDonaldTrump policy of detention and separation. This is doing long-term and permanent damage to children cruelly and vindictively.  https://t.co/D5jODIpSXASo @realDonaldTrump hire Joe Otting from Treasury’s Comptroller of Currency told me he’s NEVER observed discrimination of any kind in US. Not racial, ethnic or gender. Disturbing answer from regulator charged with protecting against lending discrimination https://t.co/Xhnti4pYcxThrilled to be with Mayor @JoeCurtatone, Treasurer Deb Goldberg @MassTreasury and other leaders at Somerville High this morning celebrating the groundbreaking for a new state-of-the-art facility. Our students and educators deserve the best we can provide to help them succeed. https://t.co/1wYkluRHLiIs @realDonaldTrump adopting a new practice that translates into “It’s OK to beat your wife”?? AG Sessions says US will now deny asylum to domestic violence victims from countries that embrace such inhumane action. This is shameful and immoral. https://t.co/hxlHNvHwUkGreat to see Mayor @marty_walsh this weekend and congratulations to the Cape Verdean Police Association for a successful scholarship gala. Thanks for all you do. https://t.co/USeFSgdvBQThe public support for net neutrality is overwhelming and bipartisan, yet @realDonaldTrump and @FCC make repeal of #NetNeutrality official today.  I’m calling for a vote in the People’s House to #SaveTheInternetIn my latest newsletter: hypocritical spending and wrongheaded approach to the #budget; bipartisan water and public safety legislation; addressing cruelty in #Immigration policy; and more on my push for #payequity. https://t.co/CcRrijITR3The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land no matter how much @realDonaldTrump wishes it wasn’t. By not defending the ACA in court, the administration seeks to sabotage it once again. Real people are hurt by these political games https://t.co/yWGoAV74WfThe #EqualPayAct became law 55 years ago yet the gender pay gap is still very real. This negatively impacts women and their families. That's why I support the #PaycheckFairnessAct &amp; why I'm pushing the administration to explain why they won’t even collect basic data on this issueIt is a violation of our Constitution every time Trump’s companies take payments from foreign governments. While @realDonaldTrump doesn’t seem to care, I do. That’s why I joined almost 200 Members and @MyConstitution demanding the courts hold him accountable. #NoOneAboveTheLawI stand with over 100 colleagues demanding @realDonaldTrump withdraw the EPA’s recently-proposed "transparency rule" to selectively suppress scientific evidence. Don’t get distracted by  @EPAScottPruitt scandal of the day. Far too much is at stake #CensoringScience. https://t.co/XYBSdmXNJIWage discrimination is not a rare or isolated practice. It affects millions of women and minorities in the workplace at all levels. I’m asking OMB Director Mick Mulvaney AGAIN why he won’t even allow for the collection of basic data on this persistent problem. https://t.co/M5xa0aO8aMOral arguments begin Thursday in our lawsuit against @realDonaldTrump demanding he comply with the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause. I’m one of 198 Members of Congress insisting Trump stop violating the Constitution  #NoOneAboveTheLawIt seems @realDonaldTrump has been busy lately issuing Executive Orders attacking federal unions. Actions include limiting the amount of time union reps can help colleagues with harassment or whistleblower complaints -this is a major step backward for workers all over the countryWhile the Supreme Court ruled in favor of #MasterpieceCakeshop, it’s important to note the court also underscored the equality of #LGBTQ people and their right to live free from discrimination. It’s important we amplify this message and keep fighting for full equality. #OpenToAllIn my latest newsletter, I report on my week in the District. I visited @TedPeanutButter, Everett Supply, @BostonABCD and Union Square Main Streets. And while there were no votes in the House, I still have updates to my #BehindTheCurtain feature. https://t.co/CBifyqmVZBThe skies may be cloudy but the enthusiasm is high celebrating the renovated Longfellow Bridge, built with union labor. It is now open after a comprehensive update while still preserving its historic nature. Thanks also to my local and state partners for your important work. https://t.co/aAIhZRKtm8My own children went to Head Start so I know firsthand what a great program it is. Thanks to @BostonABCD for inviting me to celebrate the end of the school year with you and Head Start families. https://t.co/iVqsavyUZcI am looking forward to participating in tomorrow’s ceremonial ribbon cutting for the Longfellow Bridge, a project for which I obtained federal funding to help get the renovation started. https://t.co/5GZp1JtlkfThanks to the staff at Teddie Peanut Butter as well as Everett Supply and True Value Hardware for spending some time with me this afternoon sharing your experiences about how federal policies can impact local businesses. https://t.co/ETuxghBUYGTonight from 6:30 – 8:00 PM I’m holding a community meeting at the Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center, located at 650 Dudley Street in Dorchester. I hope you can join us.I was grateful to be in Boston this Memorial Day afternoon at the Puerto Rican Veterans Monument, honoring our service members and remembering the sacrifices they and their families have made for our country. https://t.co/YgptffZlACIn Everett commemorating  Memorial Day and honoring the sacrifices of our women and men in uniform who lost their lives serving our great country. Please keep them and our Gold Star families in your hearts, today and every day. https://t.co/u1NER172m9In Chelsea this Memorial Day, honoring and remembering all those who gave their lives in service to our country. https://t.co/EwNvz5BGfNEvery time I think @realDonaldTrump reaches a new low, he goes even lower. Ripping children from the arms of their parents just to prove he's a tough guy on immigration is unconscionable. https://t.co/5njOp2XOoYIn my latest newsletter: Honoring our military women and men, an upcoming community meeting in Dorchester, an op-ed I wrote for @BayStateBanner, my thoughts on three recent votes in the House, and — as always— updates to my #BehindTheCurtain feature.
https://t.co/epzVyKI2h2Proud to stand with #PlannedParenthood at the #NoGagRule rally in Boston https://t.co/Oo941dfCcwI stand with #PlannedParenthood, joining the #NoGagRule rally at Boston City Hall Plaza today where I’ll speak at 5:45. This dangerous rollback of Title X will make it harder to access preventive care and intrude on the doctor patient relationshipSome days it’s hard to find words for the heartlessness of @realDonaldTrump administration. It is outrageous that Ed Sec Betsy DeVos suggested it was up to local schools to decide whether to follow US Constitution and provide an education to all, regardless of immigration status.Hope you can join me tonight from 7:00 – 8:00 PM for a telephone community meeting, just call 877-229-8493 and use PIN 116139. If you’d like to ask me a question, press *3 after joining the meeting.Another disgraceful attack on women’s rights by @realDonaldTrump, his administration is advancing changes to Title X - restricting access to preventive care and making it illegal for facilities with Title X funds to even talk to patients about all their health care options.House Republicans are on track to roll back essential consumer protections, including easing reporting requirements that help identify discrimination in lending. It’s part of a bill to make life easier for big banks. I had something to say about that today https://t.co/AC254Fg4BzThe American people overwhelming support #NetNeutrality, yet @realDonaldTrump’s FCC voted to end it.  I’m calling for a vote in the People’s House to #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/snJdQo6k8eSharing an op-ed I wrote for the Bay State Banner on the chaos of Trump’s presidency and how that turmoil is masking the dismantling of past policies https://t.co/i76kN9aWtwGreat day for the Haitian American Unity Parade, celebrating with @marty_walsh and Randolph Town Councillor-at-Large @NatachaClerger https://t.co/e7EDonCVsGIn my latest newsletter: My statements on Gaza and today's school shooting in Texas, details about upcoming virtual and in-person community meetings, notes on recent legislation, and additions to my #BehindTheCurtain feature. https://t.co/R7ShVd9vUtThe time for action on guns is long past. We owe it to the families in Texas and everyone traumatized by gun violence. My full statement: https://t.co/UA9gB2OkbSTrump’s move to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and others is disgraceful.  Make no mistake, this dangerous policy will make it far more difficult for millions of women to obtain preventive health care. https://t.co/nW3jG22Dj8Hope you can join me tonight at 7 PM for a telephone community meeting. Just dial 877-229-8493 and use PIN 116139. If you’d like to ask a question, press *3I’m proud to support a discharge resolution that would force a vote on DACA in the House. #ProtectDreamersPresident Trump called human beings animals.  The Declaration of Independence reads: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal..” Have you read it @realDonaldTrump ? Your hateful rhetoric is offensive, racist and un-American. https://t.co/JdMSwcuEVxHope you can join me at 7:05 tonight for my telephone community meeting. Just call 877-229-8493 and use PIN 116139. If you’d like to ask me a question, press *3 after joining the meeting.Thank you @SenMarkey! #SavetheInternet https://t.co/xryGCBhSsFThe Senate has PASSED @SenMarkey’s resolution to save #NetNeutrality. This is an important victory for everyone who relies on the internet. Now, on to the House. https://t.co/Y7CMR1jX2wThe internet doesn’t belong to @realDonaldTrump or the @FCC, it belongs to all of us. #NetNeutrality ensures equal access to websites and apps. I won’t stop fighting for a free and open internet.Honored to join the celebration of the third annual Haitian Heritage and Flag Day. Special thanks to the Everett Haitian Community Center – an important force for good in the community – for the invitation. https://t.co/GdktVMB94ECongratulations to Somerville High School’s Vocational Award winners.

Even candidate Trump supported giving Medicare the power to negotiate directly with drug companies to lower prices for seniors. Real reform is needed, not a so-called plan that does more for drug company stock prices than consumersIn my latest newsletter: the #IranDealWithdrawal, additions to my #BehindTheCurtain feature, and my thoughts on some of the legislation that passed the House this week. https://t.co/xfpRiF5kcFMet with some constituents this morning to discuss the importance of protecting abortion access nationally. Proud to support the Women’s Health Protection Act! #ActForWomen #NARAL https://t.co/5pc7XAsi9cOnce again @realDonaldTrump chooses big corporations over people by eliminating net neutrality. Without #NetNeutrality, big business gets an unfair advantage over consumers and small business.  #SaveTheInternetHope you can join me for a telephone community meeting starting right now! Just call 877-229-8493 and use PIN 116139. If you’d like to ask me a question, press *3 after joining the meeting.President Trump's decision to back out of the Iran deal could very well be the most dangerous action he has taken so far. My full statement: https://t.co/n2u2RJOsCuI won’t stop fighting for families who will be hurt by this. Make no mistake – this isn’t about the deficit. Trump already showed he doesn’t care about that by giving tax cuts to millionaires and corporations.  It's about scoring political points at the expense of the vulnerableLow income children and their families in communities all over our country rely on the Children’s Health Insurance Program yet Pres Trump cruelly proposes cutting millions from it. The administration’s destructive policies are creating uncertainty and fear. It's unconscionable.Proud to address the 45th Annual Meeting of Mission Hill Neighborhood ​Housing Services last night honoring Theresa Parks and Catherine "Kay" Gallagher for their work in the community https://t.co/AA6Mr4KudKBeautiful day for a rally in Cambridge during Affordable Housing Week of Action. Too many families can't afford to stay in their communities because costs are too high. We can solve this by increasing investment in housing programs. https://t.co/5zrUABo04xIn my latest newsletter: upcoming telephone community meetings, "Behind the Curtain" updates, and my visits around the district this past week. https://t.co/Sct44pzfHJCongratulations to the Boston to Salem ferry on receiving a $3.4 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration. These funds will be used to acquire a second ferry vessel and rehabilitate a pier to accommodate that ferry.The not-so-veiled threats directed at the Justice Department and Special Counsel Mueller paint a bright line right to obstruction if @realDonaldTrump continues down this path. Sounds like he knows it too by hiring a new lawyer with impeachment experience.This should not be partisan.  Constitution is clear – no Pres can unilaterally engage in an act of war without Congressional approval. My bill H.R. 1923 prohibits the President from further use of military force against Syria unless authorized by Congress.
https://t.co/hNLDnpSS2OThanks to the East Cambridge Business Association for an engaging discussion this morning. As always, I appreciate the invitation. https://t.co/kaqYBBLA4eH.R. 4 authorizes the FAA for five years. It contains passenger protections and helps airports upgrade and improve facilities.

https://t.co/HNAPwGbqxOHonoring the mission of PFLAG tonight and congratulations to Christian de Jesus Franco - the Elsie Frank scholarship winner. https://t.co/2qDGsya7axToday I met with @Vets4AmerIdeals. We discussed the importance of SIVs and refugee adminissions in the US. 50,000 Muslim interpreters have supported our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must fight for those who fought alongside us. #SaveSIV #RefugeesWelcome https://t.co/At0Wtmqn19Trump's HUD Sec Ben Carson saw no problem wasting $31,000 in taxpayer money on a dining room set.  Now he wants to TRIPLE the amount the POOREST families in America pay for rent!!!! That's just plain CRUEL to families being targeted one more time by this heartless Administration.Months after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, FEMA is STILL not properly managing recovery. This week FEMA told 1700 people their housing aid was ending only to turn around the next day and say, never mind. Uncertainty isn't helping. FEMA must do more to aid our fellow citizens.Why make it harder for people who need help putting food on the table? The current average food stamp recipient only receives $4 a day. Instead of providing a livable benefit, the new farm bill further restricts the temporarily unemployed from getting help when they most need it.At a financial services committee hearing last week I questioned Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on his decision to stop the federal government from collecting data to combat the gender and minority pay gap. https://t.co/DMGXCyfU4iOne more from the NAACP dinner, with Juan Cofield. Thanks for your leadership and activism. https://t.co/iK8mYnE4rOHappy to support the mission of the NAACP at last night's annual dinner. https://t.co/z2MdhbaActGreat to see friends, American Friends Service Committee, and Veterans for Peace standing up for economic justice in Cambridge today! https://t.co/rFGI2iwss8An expanding monopoly in our midst, 3 new bills that loosen control on financial institutions to the risk of customers, &amp; the GOP's hypocrisy of proposing a balanced budget amendment after ballooning the federal deficit with massive tax cuts for the rich: https://t.co/jxzgIgYY70A few missiles won’t stop Assad and it risks broader conflict. We deserve a coordinated international plan w clear goals and we demand Spkr Ryan brings an AUMF up for debate.Today is #EqualPayDay. Women work 3 months more to earn the same pay as men.  It’s time for Congress to stand up for families &amp; our economy by passing the #PaycheckFairness Act!On #EqualPayDay I again call on Federal Reserve Chair Powell to focus more on the gender wage gap. It impacts our economy and the overall financial security of families.#EqualPayDay is today. The 1963 Equal Pay Act requires men and women to get equal pay for equal work. But in 2018, that is still not happening. Call on the Trump Administration to support workplace equality and stop blocking @USEEOC pay data collection.No @realDonaldTrump, Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation is not “an attack on our country”. Russian meddling in our election - the subject of Mueller’s investigation – that’s an attack on our country. Get your facts straight.The resolve and determination isn't wavering. I saw it again today at the #TownHallForOurLives with @RepStephenLynch. I am proud of all the students leading the way. https://t.co/zcUU8a5MR0In my newsletter: the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., ribbon cutting at the Dr. Lucy Sewall Center for Acute Treatment Services, connecting with Somerville High students about activism and policy, and additions to my #BehindTheCurtain feature. https://t.co/0u6AGmScFN https://t.co/UF7Tj28xJaHappy to work with @RepKClark and State Senator @joeboncore to give impacted communities additional resources https://t.co/4Beav6MRh8Ranking Members @BobbyScott and @RepJerryNadler shared @USGAO report which shows students of color receive harsher discipline regardless of income https://t.co/JzJ4QTuWjW Much more must be done to address this persistent problem. #InClassNotCuffs #RethinkDisciplineAs we reflect on his legacy, let us acknowledge that though progress has been made, much work remains if we are to truly realize his dream of a nation free of racism and bias. Let us continue as Dr. King would have wanted; together and through peaceful, nonviolent acts. #MLK5050 years ago the world lost a civil rights activist, preacher &amp; transformational leader. As a divinity student at Boston University, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. came to recognize the power of nonviolent protest, which gave the civil rights movement its deep moral resonance.In my latest newsletter: activism on #GunReform, a forum on #NetNeutrality, the latest #BehindTheCurtain, and legislation I filed to encourage States and local school districts to include the study of #Nonviolence into the teaching of history and civics. https://t.co/kftVlzuM49As more companies in UK release gender pay gap data as law requires, it's obvious a brighter spotlight is needed. That’s why I'm pushing the Fed Reserve to measure the wage gap here. They have the authority to analyze and assess its impact on the economy. https://t.co/TsCmGqriBtThanks so much to @MomsDemand Action for Gun Sense in America for inviting me to speak at your new member meeting. Your activism is inspiring. https://t.co/2dMGe7JhmKFar too much is at stake – from fair representation in Congress to federal money to help communities make improvements. Congress must act to prevent this change and we must all vigorously defend the accuracy of the census.   https://t.co/OkZ2a9zP3GAs noted in my Behind the Curtain #218, by adding a census citizenship question, Trump Admin disregards the Constitution &amp; seeks to suppress immigrant voices. Our democracy requires a fair, nonpartisan population count, not a politically motivated one that won’t get the job doneThanks to the Randolph Youth Council for inviting me to stand with you demanding action on gun reform. I am honored to join so many committed young people who are leading the way.#MarchForOurLives https://t.co/XCGHcptV84So much energy and resolve at the March for Our Lives. I am so proud of all the young women and men who are leading the way. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/UUqwyWuBp4As young people prepare to join the March for Our Lives tomorrow the Trump Administration just began the process to ban bump stocks. Coincidence? No. The raised voices of our young activists are impacting policy. Don't give up. Keep pushing. @AMarch4OurLivesIn my latest newsletter, I write about a mixed bag of new regulatory legislation, the latest bill to fund the government, student and community activism events in the district, not to mention more additions and updates to my "Behind the Curtain" feature. https://t.co/HM7W2gTDj4Today I met with the Human Rights Campaign to discuss the importance of the #EqualityAct, #TransMilitary Service, #DreamAct and gun violence prevention measures. I won’t stop fighting for fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for #LGBTQ people across the country. https://t.co/xwHinshsyFIraq invasion began today in 2003. It was aggressive, unnecessary and taken under false pretenses. The cost is literally incalculable, lives lost, families broken, resources wasted. I opposed the war, a vote I'm proud of. Thinking today, with love and respect, of all who served.Today, #6monthsaftermaria, @realDonaldTrump and @dhsgov must be held accountable for FEMA’s failure to oversee the disaster response and recovery. Adequate funding and distribution of aid for #PuertoRico must be top priority.Thanks to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas local alumni for inviting me to participate in last night’s gun violence panel. The other side is banking on us losing hope or giving up. Not happening.  #NeverAgainMSD #March4OurLives https://t.co/6xkNkkMZoZProud to join 82 Democrats on a letter to House Leadership and Appropriators demanding that the #DreamAct be added to the Omnibus &amp; that funding for deportations, detention &amp; walls be stripped. #DefundHate #heretostay @RepGutierrezIn my latest newsletter, I write about National Walk Out Day and a small step towards making schools safer, three new bills that give yet more power to big banks and financial institutions, as well as additions to my "Behind the Curtain" feature. https://t.co/4MGKTF4VjZJoined @RepDanRyan for the annual Flatley Company St. Patrick's Day Luncheon this morning in Charlestown! https://t.co/L9yXlALEq5Thanks to Public Citizen for inviting me to join a FB Live session on the poison pill campaign finance riders in the draft budget.

I wish I could join students in MA as they march to the State House but I’m there in spirit, standing with their fellow students at Capitol Hill. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/bze72Yh9B3Impressive display of student unity on #NationalWalkoutDay.  I will never stop pushing for common sense gun control.

With the stroke of a pen, Trump made it easier for people who are “mentally disturbed” – his words – to get a gun.Trump tweeted today “so many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed. . .” The hypocrisy here is truly astounding. In Feb 2017 he signed law banning the Social Security Admin from giving names of those with severe, medically documented mental disabilities. . .It’s impossible to offer soothing words today that come close to expressing the anger and sorrow I feel after another school massacre.  What will it take for Republicans in Congress to tighten gun laws? All we ask is for a floor vote.  How many more lives have to be lost?Trump’s plan requires the $200 billion to be offset but doesn’t specify what should be cut to do it.  It's also being sold as a $1.5 trillion plan but it really isn’t. That number assumes over $1 trillion in nonfederal infrastructure spending will suddenly materialize. It won’t.The plan shifts more of the funding burden to states and communities, undermines environmental regulations and reduces necessary oversight by dramatically speeding up the permitting process. 1 detail the plan neglects is perhaps the most important, where's the money coming from?After more than a year of promises, President Trump finally released his infrastructure plan and it wasn’t worth the wait.  Although it claims to be a $200 billion plan, cuts to current funding for programs like New Starts and Amtrak decrease overall infrastructure spending.Maybe it’s not so cold at Mar-a-Lago or the White House, but people die in the winter because they cannot afford to heat their homes.  This falls disproportionately on our poor senior citizens and is one the most heartless proposals I have seen in quite a while.Trump’s war on our poorest citizens continues – his budget ELIMINATES the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  That’s the program started under Ronald Reagan to help some of our neighbors pay for heating fuel in the winter.Two of Trump's top aides left following allegations of domestic violence yet the President defends these men without ever mentioning the female victims.
