United we stand in defense of families. Great to see so many colleagues &amp; friends at the #FamiliesBelongTogether rally in #Chicago today! https://t.co/ogYEOFmvG8I know that we can combat our nation's staggering #gunviolence epidemic by enacting smart &amp; substantive policy changes. 

Please share your thoughts on what you'd like Congress to do to help saves lives by filling out my survey here: https://t.co/G6ie7IksBFCurious about the #QuigleyClimateTour? 

I‚Äôm at @IndianaDunesNPS right in #Chicago‚Äôs backyard to learn more about increasing temperatures, changing weather patterns, invasive species, native plant populations‚Äîand how all are being influenced by #ClimateChange. https://t.co/ev4BVJk6tn@parkridgean @kcbyrne @IndianaDunesNPS These dramatic swings cause extreme erosion, damaging and challenging all kinds of species living along the #GreatLakes. It‚Äôs not that the lakes are higher; it‚Äôs how quickly they bounce from high to low and supercharge existing cycles. #QuigleyClimateTour@parkridgean @kcbyrne @IndianaDunesNPS Thanks for asking! Typically, cycles of water levels in the #GreatLakes run about 20 years, leading to predictable &amp; safe erosion that helps maintain the dunes. However, in the last 5 years, we‚Äôve seen historic low lake levels &amp; near historic highs. #QuigleyClimateTourLast summer, this observation deck had 20 feet of sand behind it. Today, it‚Äôs on the beach‚Äîdestroyed thanks to extreme weather &amp; rising water levels. #QuigleyClimateTour @IndianaDunesNPS https://t.co/xhFMHZ6cWmToday, I kicked off my third #QuigleyClimateTour on @IndianaDunesNPS‚Äô Cowles Bog Trail, where I joined @NatlParkService employees &amp; researches for a discussion on #climatechange impacts on restoration efforts. https://t.co/SCOwmNrWs4179th day of the year.
154th mass shooting. 
Heartbroken &amp; furious don't even begin to cover it. 

https://t.co/5g6ZzyhRhMPerhaps now more than ever, we must recognize the vital role a free press plays in our democracy. No journalist‚Äîor any other worker in any other industry‚Äîshould have to fear for their safety simply for stepping foot in their workplace. https://t.co/NRxrZUmisUWrapped up another summer intern session with a few #hockey tips!

A big thank you to our fantastic DC #interns‚ÄîMichael, Matilda &amp; Sydney‚Äîfor all of their hard work on behalf of #IL05 these past few weeks. https://t.co/fbi5iGO9LqTomorrow, I'll lead my 3rd #ClimateChange tour on the devastating environmental impacts being felt by our #NationalParks. Use #QuigleyClimateTour to follow along as I visit @IndianaDunesNPS to talk with researches &amp; get a firsthand look at the effects on the #GreatLakes.Senator McConnell should respect his own precedent &amp; delay voting on Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nomination until after the election. The American people are watching and will not sit idly by as the values, rights &amp; opportunities we hold dear come under attack. https://t.co/ExDE81vgaEWe cannot allow the next Justice, chosen on the basis of powerful special interests or Trump loyalty, to reverse the progress Americans have spent decades fighting for. #SaveSCOTUSThe upcoming Supreme Court vacancy has the ability to call into question the fate of our most vital defenses: from health care and voting protections to fundamental rights for women, the LGBTQ community, and millions more in our middle class. https://t.co/B1pcPJ5JlB #SaveSCOTUSProud to join dozens of my Dem colleagues in sending a letter to #DHS demanding answers on charges that #immigrant teenagers were handcuffed &amp; beaten in federal custody. Threatening the health of these vulnerable children is unacceptable &amp; inexcusable. https://t.co/qKvqJmclXNConservatives must stop attacking workers &amp; start helping create a system that benefits everyone. I'll continue to partner w/ Dems to defend unions &amp; support legislative solutions that give all public-sector workers the freedom to stand together &amp; negotiate for fair conditions.By increasing the number of free riding workers, #unions could be forced to drastically reduce their budgets, which in turn weakens their ability to negotiate stronger contracts and defend the rights of American workers who deserve a fair wage and a fair workplace. #JANUSvsAFSCME https://t.co/TY6shlArzlToday‚Äôs flawed #JANUSvsAFSCME decision is just another example in a litany of instances where conservative judges, Republican elected officials, &amp; their donors have attempted to rig the economy against hardworking Americans for the benefit of billionaires. https://t.co/X44WshyabNAs a proud Chicagoan, I understand the role #unions play in rebuilding our shrinking middle class. 

#JANUSvsAFSCME #SCOTUS ruling just reversed 41yrs of precedent to undermine the freedom of our laborers, teachers, police officers, firefighters, factory &amp; transportation workers.An important #ICYMI for @HouseGOP &amp; @realDonaldTrump:

65% of those polled said a candidate‚Äôs support for continued protections for people with #PreExistingConditions is either the ‚Äúsingle most important factor‚Äù or ‚Äúvery important‚Äù in their vote. https://t.co/haUYUU9XWCWhether it‚Äôs getting a job or an education, accessing the news or expressing yourself online‚ÄîA free &amp; open #Internet is essential to the success of our nation. We need to restore #NetNeutrality &amp; I applaud the concerned &amp; committed citizens participating in today's Day of Action.Small biz rely on #NetNeutrality to connect with customers nationwide‚ÄîThese entrepreneurs use the Internet as an equal playing field to compete w/ larger corporations.

That's just one reason I signed a discharge petition to force a vote on #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/YdThxVsFtoWow is right. Even President Trump is surprised. 

This flawed decision by the Court blatantly ignores &amp; undermines our founding principles, including religious tolerance. This is not who we are. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/kNqSFuxWKo"How do you keep Russian hackers from messing up American elections?

There are several Democratic bills that could solve this problem.

This is unacceptable‚Äîwhich is why I cosponsored the #VotingRights Advancement Act to #RestoreTheVOTE#Voting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the #VRA, much more work remains to ensure our #democracy is accessible to all Americans. #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/hlgsoU0qnIRT to show your support for inclusion, compassion, acceptance &amp; #equality for all. During #ChicagoPride, thousands of citizens emphasized our unyielding commitment to #DisarmHate üåà https://t.co/SN3pX263aOA nice end to the weekend at the 4th annual Lincoln Central #summer supper! https://t.co/rqtod5Bx5KAlways a special day in #IL05! Great to participate in my 36th consecutive #ChicagoPride Parade. https://t.co/nEORhZMqPsToday, I was honored &amp; humbled to take part in the #MarchForFamilies rally in #IL05. Hundreds of concerned citizens turned out to make clear their voices &amp; their values. We support the dignity of all people &amp; the reunification of families that have been ripped apart. https://t.co/W9mYO60ENoDid you know: approx. 41 states still use voting machines that have not been replaced in over a decade?

My "Prevent Election Hacking Act" will allow #cyber experts to identify additional vulnerabilities that could undermine the integrity of our elections. https://t.co/t79KF8R2dZIn less than a week, my office has received over 800 phone calls, emails &amp; letters from #IL05 constituents regarding the crisis at our border. My constituents are alarmed, ashamed &amp; angry. Their outrage is warranted and I share it. 

Take a listen to what they've had to say: https://t.co/eV01rnRvs5We demand answers to the following questions. RT to tell @DHSgov &amp; @HHSGov to provide them. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/t7xmugBvvDThe American people‚Äî&amp; the world‚Äîwant and deserve answers. That's why I joined my Dem colleagues in sending a letter to @DHSgov &amp; @HHSGov demanding clarification on their separation policy &amp; answers on what is being done to support reunification. Read here: https://t.co/tXmiJoy7X8My staff is out &amp; about in #IL05 once again for rotating office hours. Today, from 12-2pm CT, they are at the Schiller Park Library! https://t.co/AwkAPpI420My "Prevent Election Hacking Act" will enlist the unique knowledge of #cybersecurity experts to safeguard the foundation of our #democracy‚Äîthe right to free and fair #elections. Read more: https://t.co/t79KF8zrmrThe Intelligence Community has determined that at least 21 state #election systems were targeted in the lead-up to 2016. 

Now, we must join together &amp; step up to identify the vulnerabilities that exist so we can implement infrastructure upgrades that address them head on.Unfortunately, many state &amp; local election boards don‚Äôt even know when they‚Äôve been hacked‚Äîeither because they don‚Äôt know what to look for or don‚Äôt have the #tech needed to help spot an intrusion. The new bipartisan bill I intro'd w/ @RepJohnKatko will improve our understanding.Russia &amp; other foreign actors who wish us harm don‚Äôt have to hack into every single board of election to undermine our democratic process; it just takes a couple to achieve their goal of eroding public trust in our electoral system.Today, I was proud to introduce the Prevent #Election #Hacking Act of 2018 to combat the threat posed by foreign adversaries‚ÄîThis bipartisan bill creates a new competition that rewards #cybersecurity experts who are able to identify vulnerabilities in our election infrastructure.Let #WorldRefugeeDay serve as a critical &amp; timely reminder on the need to maintain our role as a beacon of hope for those fleeing persecution and violence. We can &amp; must do better. https://t.co/5DbZ7dVzd3Congress must stand up to the President as he pulls families apart, using children as bargaining chips. The Appropriations Committee must be willing to use the power of the purse‚Äîand withhold the funding needed to implement these draconian policies. #FamiliesBelongTogetherJust this week, Secretary Nielsen demonstrated just how out of touch #DHS is as it relates to this immoral policy. We are not in the business of building expensive, ineffective walls. We are not in the business of turning away asylum seekers. #FamiliesBelongTogetherRepublicans support the President‚Äôs requested funding levels, which prioritize Trump‚Äôs cruel immigration policies with a dramatic increase for the Department of Homeland Security. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThe President‚Äôs statements have effectively obscured and distracted from the emergency at hand. Make no mistake: this is Trump‚Äôs policy; is not a law that must be enforced. It is a choice being made everyday by this Administration. #FamiliesBelongTogether#Appropriations Democrats are using the end of the State &amp; Foreign operations markup to speak out against Trump‚Äôs abhorrent family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogetherI‚Äôve also urged appropriators overseeing #DHS to ensure that the agency cannot use appropriated funds to separate families seeking safety. You can read my letter here: https://t.co/ea6fVtOIBD https://t.co/uTkZ59nUQhFor starters, I‚Äôve cosponsored a bill that:
-Prohibits DHS separation unless parental rights have been terminated or being with the parent keeps the child in danger
-requires border patrol officials to undergo annual child welfare training
-develops procedures to reunite families https://t.co/uTkZ59nUQhIn less than a week, my office has received 645 calls, emails &amp; letters from constituents expressing their strong opposition to family separation‚ÄîThis isn‚Äôt smart #immigration policy; it‚Äôs just callous.

Thank you for making your voice heard on the need to #KeepFamiliesTogether.Are you as outraged by the heartless separation of children from their parents as I am? Your voice matters. Call your representative today to tell them to #KeepFamilesTogether: 202-225-3121In order to combat inaction &amp; denial from the White House, concerned citizens &amp; environmental advocates must continue to sound the alarm on #climatechange‚ÄîI thank @Nature_Climate for having me &amp; for all they do to unite, inform &amp; engage Americans on the need to protect our earth. https://t.co/TD5aJI6GJlI‚Äôm proud to cosponsor this incredibly important piece of legislation that will help #KeepFamiliesTogether.

I'm sensing a trend here... This growing theme only underscores the need to continue our investigation &amp; protect Mueller's probe. https://t.co/1SrCcVxKEvICYMI: Antarctica is roughly 9,000 miles from #Chicago. But what‚Äôs happening there is a clear warning that ever-stronger storms, species die-offs, droughts, damage to the #GreatLakes &amp; other #climatechange effects will show up here... if we don‚Äôt act now. https://t.co/eg6eWCa2PmRussia‚Äôs work is not done &amp; neither should our efforts to counter their actions. My amendment would provide $$ to improve cybersecurity defenses &amp; update election infrastructure so our foreign adversaries can't undermine the integrity of our democracy. https://t.co/f60TRvyD2kFor the last 2yrs, I‚Äôve been sounding the alarm that our election infrastructure is outdated, low-tech &amp; nowhere near where it needs to be to prevent future intrusions from foreign adversaries. That is why I intro'd an amendment to provide $380M in grants to #ProtectOurDemocracy.The FSGG bill would also interfere in the local affairs of the District: repealing law allowing DC to use its own funds w/o Congressional approval, prohibiting funds for DC needle exchange programs, blocking local legalization of marijuana, banning DC‚Äôs Death w/ Dignity Act &amp;moreThe CDFI fund is inexplicably cut by $59 million in this bill. This means fewer resources to spur economic growth &amp; revitalization in our most underserved &amp; neglected communities. Cutting a bipartisan program by +20% means less affordable housing &amp; key infrastructure.The SEC, which is tasked with protecting investors and ensuring fairness in our capital markets, is cut by over $200 million, even though the commission‚Äôs budget is financed by industry fees, not taxpayer funds.After losing over a billion dollars in funding and 18,000 staff between 2010 and 2017, Republicans have reversed course and have begun providing IRS with additional funding to implement their new tax law. Yet, taxpayer service is cut by $15 million.As Ranking Member of the #FinancialServices &amp; General Government #Appropriations Subcommittee, I voiced my strong opposition to the FY19 FSGG bill.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me on such an important issue. #IL05 https://t.co/y2tvjOeqImBeyond a self-serving photo-op, the only thing to definitively come from the summit was increased uncertainty for South Korea. By conceding to the Kim regime &amp; ending joint military exercises, the Trump Administration has undermined a key component of Seoul‚Äôs defense strategy.The President had one goal for this meeting: achieve complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization. Instead, he received vague commitments from Kim Jong-un, which only underscore Trump‚Äôs lack of strategy and unpreparedness for this summit.I will always support diplomacy first‚Äîthe world is complicated &amp; we must be willing to engage with our adversaries and our enemies alike. Unfortunately, yesterday‚Äôs summit in Singapore was less about substantive diplomatic talks as it was about ineffectual political theatre.Our schools should always be a safe place for students to learn &amp; grow.

It's real, and it's Russia. https://t.co/FGO5XGSMXBThe evidence of collusion is not fading; it is flourishing. That is why I am calling on Chairman Nunes &amp; Speaker Ryan to reopen our HPSCI investigation and finally join Democrats in playing an authentic, active role in our search for answers. https://t.co/UNTj5jOTFUBy choosing to prematurely end the committee‚Äôs investigation into Russian meddling in our election, House Republicans are allowing the safety and security of our country to take a backseat to a self-perceived, short-term political victory.The ever-growing web of connections between the president‚Äôs inner circle and Russian officials is no coincidence. Unfortunately, HPSCI Republicans have decided to ignore these blatant links and dismiss all instances of consequential communication‚Äîand now direct payment.Less than a week after the public learned that Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg was questioned by Mueller, we also became aware that the same oligarch paid Michael Cohen $500k‚Äîadding to list of troubling revelations made since Republicans shut down HPSCI Russia InvestigationIn the absence of sound Presidential leadership, Congress must step in to fill the void &amp; uphold our commitments to defend national and global security alike. 

Read my full statement on the president‚Äôs decision to withdraw from the #IranDeal: https://t.co/VVDiCJCBjuThe US should embrace the opportunity to lead a more comprehensive, international strategy towards Iran, North Korea &amp; all countries with nuclear aspirations. We must move together in an effort to abolish nuclear weapons &amp; promote a global policy of non-proliferation. #IranDealAs we prepare to break this pledge that will only serve to destabilize the region, our European partners have made it clear that they will stay a party to JCPOA, further isolating America from the world and the vital decision-making that determines our shared fate.  #IranDeal https://t.co/M1anrkYGdRThe credibility of the United States must be maintained in both word &amp; action, and when we walk away from the table, our integrity is seriously damaged. In turn, we weaken our ability to lead effective change elsewhere in the world. #IranDeal https://t.co/VVDiCJCBjuThe decision to walk away from the #IranDeal will not only impact our relationship with Iran &amp; spur a ripple of consequences across the Middle East, but it will also affect our ongoing negotiations with #NorthKorea.Trump‚Äôs decision to pull out of the #IranDeal is dangerous, shortsighted, and will make America‚Äîand our allies‚Äîless safe. 

Despite the deceptive rhetoric &amp; degradation of the JCPOA by its critics, the facts remain: JCPOA is working &amp; is containing #Iran‚Äôs nuclear ambitions.Happy #TeacherAppreciationDay to all of the #Chicago #teachers that educate &amp; empower our nation's next generation of leaders.

It's alarming that while he submitted a budget request of $0 for CFBP (&amp; previously advocated for its elimination), he also signed off on large pay raises for senior staff.1 of OMB‚Äôs key responsibilities is production of the President‚Äôs budget gov-wide. On that measure, I'm afraid OMB has managed to disappoint me even more than last yr.

Today, I asked @MickMulvaneyOMB about #TrumpBudget, which would create an annual deficit of $984B in its 1st yr.Urban #flooding frequently occurs outside the regulatory floodplain, and @FEMA maps don't always accurately indicate #flood risk in these areas, resulting in uncertainty of the hazards.
