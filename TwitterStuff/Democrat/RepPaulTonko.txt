This is wrong. American workers have a fundamental right to join together to bargain for fair wages, safer workplaces &amp; quality healthcare for their families. Today’s #SCOTUS decision threatens that right and the rights of all working Americans. #Janus https://t.co/LWMF75PwRFReligious freedom is a core American value enshrined in our First Amendment. Today's #SupremeCourt decision puts the religious liberty of every American at risk and casts aside our proud legacy as a strong nation unafraid to stand for the vulnerable and for what we know is right.A just society, a civil society, a truly American society, just doesn't do this to children and families.

Thanks to @WNYT's Dan Levy @dlevywnyt for reporting this important story. https://t.co/u75ymvqcpgGood news! The House just voted to advance my bill to expand access to life-saving #addiction treatment. Overdoses took 64,000 lives in 2016—the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50, yet just 1 in 5 suffering from #addiction is getting treatment today.
https://t.co/ymHHPYQztDRural schools, businesses, farmers &amp; healthcare providers need high-speed #broadband to provide critical services to their communities and fend off international competition. The #GOPfarmbill still makes a mess of #ruralbroadband funding, leaving many of these communities behind.Rural communities often struggle to secure capital for infrastructure and economic development. This #GOPfarmbill increases financing costs by adding fees to Rural Development loans.Farmers and rural businesses have been able to make excellent use of #farmbill programs to help lower energy bills and create #renewableenergy. This #GOPfarmbill still cuts funding for the Rural Energy for America Program.In the face of chaotic #trade policies coming out of the White House, farmers have repeatedly asked for more funding support for the Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program. The #GOPfarmbill ignores them.This one is so wrong it’s stunning: the #GOPfarmbill still requires #SNAP recipients to confront former partners to recoup child support, or else they lose benefits. That puts families at risk.In fact, after what’s called a “manager’s amendment”, the #GOPFarmBill’s workforce bureaucracy will actually knock an ADDITIONAL 600,000 people off #SNAP, with a total of 1.9 million of our loved ones, friends and neighbors kicked off by 2021.House Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn’t kick a single person off #SNAP. That’s also untrue. 400,000 household will lose benefits AND 265,000 kids will lose access to food security through free or subsidized school meals.House Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn’t cut #SNAP. That’s still untrue. H.R. 2 cuts $14.1 billion in benefits and imposes costly and burdensome state bureaucracies.#BREAKING-- the House is re-voting on an amended-but-still-terrible Republican #FarmBill TODAY. 

Many troubling things are happening right now that deserve our voices. This is one of them. https://t.co/Ot4pibGkAURepublican leaders are planning to bring their awful #FarmBill up for a vote soon, possibly as early as this week. 
 
There are many things going on right now that need our attention—this is one of them. https://t.co/Ot4pibGkAUA great nation builds bridges, not walls. Today Congress should convey the message that the U.S. will not abandon those who seek refuge. I’m honored to join so many people of good conscience who are marking #WorldRefugeeDay today. #RefugeesWelcomeToday we celebrate #Juneteenth marking the abolition of slavery in the United States more than 150 years ago. We herald this important occasion and express our thanks for hard-won progress, but our fight for social justice and equal opportunity for all is far from over. https://t.co/ly3aB7fkpWI am cosponsoring the Keep Families Together Act, a bill that would prohibit DHS from separating children from their parents except in extraordinary cases, allow parents to reunite with their kids if separated, and shine a light on any future abuses under this Trump Admin policy. https://t.co/CwywHmoLz3In the first 6 weeks of its so-called "Zero Tolerance" policy, the Trump Administration has separated 1,995 children from their families, and counting. This is inhumane, un-American and needs to stop. https://t.co/gNNwMdAGCq #KeepFamiliesTogether  #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/CA14NsWITPMy reaction on @cspanwj this morning on the Trump Administration policy of separating children from their families: https://t.co/Ve1Vvba5AUMy heartfelt congratulations and thanks to @MuseumofScience for 15 years of impactful investments in U.S. engineering education! https://t.co/k59uaX80HTTo all our friends and loved ones celebrating Eid today, #EidMubarak! https://t.co/7Yh94okmppIn the months before this so-called "Zero Tolerance" family separation policy was announced, some 700 children were separated from their parents. 

The number of children acknowledged to have been ripped from their families by the Trump Administration so far:

1,358 and counting.These are not the actions of a great nation, nor of a people who believe in strength of family. This must end. I am cosponsoring a House Resolution Condemning Separation of Children from their Parents at the Border and demanding we stop this inhumane activity immediately.In just 2 weeks of their new border policy taking children from parents, the Trump Admin broke up more than 600 families with no plan to reunite them.

Many fled extreme danger in search of legal asylum. Instead, infants as young as 18 months were ripped from their parents' arms.Delighted to be joining @SteveScully on @cspanwj this morning! https://t.co/9arSRchCIVThe Trump @FCC rollback of #NetNeutrality protections starts today. So if certain websites or services start getting much slower than others, you’ll know who to thank. 

In the meantime, our fight to protect America's free &amp; open Internet continues! https://t.co/rxxrCxGELGAs a reminder... https://t.co/2nrfTerVvYThe Trump Administration announced today that it won't uphold the U.S. law that protects #healthcare coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. 

The fight for Americans' healthcare rights is far from over. https://t.co/omFpdiQGCCAmericans lost nearly 45,000 of our neighbors, friends &amp; loved ones in 2016 to the silent epidemic of suicide. We're reminded of that pain with the tragic deaths of Kate Spade &amp; Anthony Bourdain. 

Share this number: Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or @800273TALKForcing taxpayers to bail out uncompetitive generators is not a sustainable path forward, but they will find willing partners in Congress for a sincere plan that drives meaningful improvements in our grid infrastructure and deals with persistent blind spots in our energy markets.I urge the Trump Administration to drop this charade and come to Congress with proposals that:
1. strengthen cybersecurity for critical infrastructure
2. sustain domestic nuclear supply
3. drive investments in our nation's energy grid to make it smarter, more reliable &amp; resilientPolicymakers have a long history of debating and supporting grid attributes that are not adequately addressed in energy markets. But those decisions should be made by elected officials in Congress or at the State level.Puerto Rico's blackout during and after Hurricane Maria, like most outages, was NOT caused by a lack of electricity generation. It was a transmission &amp; distribution failure. 

After months of weak &amp; inhumane crisis response, that has become a tragic and deadly government failure.The leaked NSC memo outlining this energy bailout shows the Trump Administration has missed the point entirely, with no lessons learned or even a mention of the most devastating blackout in our nation’s history: the failure of #PuertoRico's grid during and after Hurricane Maria.I am concerned that ratepayers are being asked to pay for a proposal cooked up with seemingly no regard for its high cost or its minuscule benefits. For many reasons, our response needs to be much more cost-effective.A @rhodium_group review found fuel emergencies/deficiencies at power plants resulted in 0.00007% of total customer hours of lost service. 

No amount of power generation will fix a downed power line, but this Administration wants consumers pay a lot more for very little benefit.@SecretaryPerry @ENERGY The Department of Energy’s second Quadrennial Energy Review showed failures in U.S. electrical distribution systems are responsible for more than 90 percent of all electric power interruptions. https://t.co/fX6QKHjJwF@SecretaryPerry @ENERGY I've written before about America's need to refocus on grid resilience instead of pushing costly efforts to prop up uncompetitive energy sources: https://t.co/Tbhhn3W99G@SecretaryPerry @ENERGY In January, federal energy regulators unanimously rejected that "fuel assurance" proposal. I posted a few comments on their decision at the time: https://t.co/nikE4RaQMDI questioned @SecretaryPerry last October on whether the Department of @Energy had looked at cost when it was cooking up this political favor to uncompetitive coal &amp; other generators.

His answer, in part: "what's the cost of freedom?" I took that as a no.
https://t.co/yfW9niRBLs@ENERGY Let’s be clear, fuel assurance doesn't guarantee generation after a disaster. During the Polar Vortex, coal piles froze. Coal piles flooded in Hurricane Harvey. This response fails to address the real vulnerabilities in our grid, most notably weaknesses in distribution systems.As a reminder, in September the @Energy Department launched a rulemaking process under Section 403 of the DoE Organization Act for federal energy regulators to provide cost recovery to coal &amp; nuclear generators based on their ability to store fuel on-site: https://t.co/oiFsjsg2YpMuch of this was revealed thanks to a leaked 41-page NSC memo showing President Trump’s Department of Energy planning to go far beyond its statutory authority and to put a political thumb on the scale of electricity markets: https://t.co/1bEgXOrubUThat would be an unprecedented market intervention, and not just unnecessary and legally indefensible but would actually drive up electricity costs for consumers and make American manufacturers less globally competitive.America is long overdue for an honest national conversation about securing, strengthening &amp; modernizing our electrical grid. 

Instead, the Trump Administration wants to turn crisis procedures (e.g. after a natural disaster) into a multi-year bailout for uncompetitive energy.The Trump Administration has floated a proposal to bail out uncompetitive electricity generators. It’s a costly, unjustifiable bit of political favoritism that hurts consumers &amp; should never see light of day. Bear with me a few tweets as I dive into the weeds of US energy policy.According to New York’s Department of Financial Services, "Without the federal action, the average requested rate increase would be 12.1 percent"

Many fought to stop this from happening &amp; things can still get worse, but they can also get better. Let's get Congress back on track.Remember when GOP leaders put a partial #healthcare repeal in their #TaxScamBill &amp; experts said rates would skyrocket?

“New York #Obamacare insurers want to raise prices for 2019 by an average 24% w/some plans seeking rate increases as high as nearly 40%” https://t.co/LTbxrNHQ0FAmerica ended self-pardons 240+ yrs ago when we won independence.

This massive treatment gap is one of the top reasons America's #OpioidEpidemic persists. We have no shortage of solutions, but for some reason Republican leaders keep blocking them from getting a vote.Consider this: "unlike the stories commonly told in the news &amp; coroners’ reports, Ricciuti did not overdose and die. Early in 2017, she got on buprenorphine... which does not produce a euphoric high when taken as prescribed." @germanrlopez #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/eeAdf4TMVIThis is stunningly bad. Holding a PFAS summit was almost a step in the right direction. But this team of @EPA political appointees can’t even get out of their own way without compromising scientific integrity or our First Amendment.Unfortunately, victims of PFAS contamination are not being represented at this @EPA summit. Few if any independent scientists are being allowed to present their views. 

Now we’re hearing reporters are being kicked out of the event, in some cases forcibly: https://t.co/6ZG3DtcFLR.@EPA needs to hear from these Americans who have been made sick by exposure to these contaminants and from independent scientists who can guide us toward smart necessary environmental protections to eliminate these dangerous chemicals from our drinking water..@EPA is convening a national summit on PFAS, contaminants affecting countless families &amp; communities—in Hoosick Falls &amp; Newburgh, NY among MANY others.
 
Sadly, victims &amp; community voices have been largely shut out of the event &amp; have no #SeatAtTheTable.

This makes no sense.@USCBO @NewYorkHunger The #GOPFarmBill also imposes asset and vehicle tests that will significantly increase the bureaucratic challenges and delays for many folks who may not even know where their next meal is coming from.@USCBO A MINIMUM of 34,000 New Yorkers would lose #SNAP food assistance under the #GOPFarmBill, a $54 million loss for our state, according to @NewYorkHunger@USCBO The #GOPFarmBill would be especially painful for New York's poorest individuals &amp; families who depend on #SNAP food assistance just to get by: https://t.co/KmXikF0LNM#NetNeutrality is officially Senate-approved!

These low-standard plans will barely be worth the paper they’re printed on. Farmers are tough, but they’re not invulnerable. https://t.co/q5YSfdhukb@USCBO Under the #GOPFarmBill, food assistance recipients would have to register highly personal private information in a national database, forcing them to choose between their own data security and their family’s food security: https://t.co/xZHNRfCnPoIf you like big, expensive and slow bureaucracies, you're going to love the #GOPFarmBill, which the non-partisan @USCBO says would spend billions creating vast impractical bureaucracies that will take more than a decade to even get up and running:  https://t.co/MsVabtl9cZIt also adds new bureaucracy and complexity to high-speed broadband development grants that farm communities have been waiting for. This makes no sense.The #GOPFarmBill slashes hundreds of millions of dollars from job-creating rural development initiatives and loan guarantees for #smallbiz. That makes life &amp; business harder for farmers and rural communities.Instead of strengthening trade assistance programs, the #GOPFarmBill simply ignores America’s small farms that are already reeling from President Trump’s patchwork trade policies.@chelliepingree Under the #GOPFarmBill, more than a quarter-million (265,000) of America’s most vulnerable and food-insecure kids will be left to go hungry at school. https://t.co/ILQUnRNuC8As my friend &amp; colleague Maine Representative @chelliepingree puts it, "Work requirements will do nothing but snatch away a lifeline from those who don’t know where their next meal will come from." https://t.co/GLsKiQ115hThese requirements targeting poor families &amp; folks approaching retirement age also ignore the practical realities of working life for millions of Americans, e.g. @CenterOnBudget: "Most Working-Age SNAP Participants Work, But Often in Unstable Jobs" https://t.co/BTTPvKAnYoThese requirements are little more than a Republican talking point, e.g. @GaBudget: “Research shows work requirements do not help people reach financial security. Instead, it leads to an abrupt loss of benefits and increased financial instability.” https://t.co/bGTnfEGiDf#SNAP food assistance already has work requirements. Congressional Republicans are imposing painful changes that target families with children and individuals between 50-59 years of age.

2 million of the most vulnerable Americans will lose food security. https://t.co/k8JXSGhKhlA majority, nearly 2/3, of all Americans receiving #SNAP food assistance are children, seniors or disabled persons.

And more than half of the remaining 1/3 have kids themselves. https://t.co/AfJbUAxlaUHere's your headline: #GOPFarmBill cuts $23 billion from #SNAP food assistance.

#SNAP supports 1 in 10 Americans, including millions of children, seniors, people with disabilities, working families and 3 million #veterans.I'll dive into heartless details, but bottom line: this bill ignores the needs of America’s farmers &amp; rips needed food assistance out of the hands of millions of America's poorest children &amp; families. https://t.co/jzYIZMrxUvCongressional Republicans are rolling out their new #FarmBill this week.

Last year, he reportedly used taxpayer funds to upgrade his official car &amp; add luxury leather seats &amp; bullet-resistant covers: https://t.co/rQ6NCO84iqEPA’s independent investigator @EPAoig has confirmed that it is investigating the Administrator’s use of an official security detail for his personal trips (Disneyland, Rose Bowl, college basketball games): https://t.co/4lRZSRc79SPruitt’s lavish taxpayer-funded security detail reportedly also traveled with him on non-official business, including trips home to Tulsa, a family vacation to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl: https://t.co/KOX5Na24N4Administrator Pruitt’s aides even considered leasing a private jet for him at a cost to taxpayers of some $100,000/month: https://t.co/gIxo7TO04P.Around that same time it came out that taxpayers had also paid more than $105,000 for Pruitt’s unusually large security detail to fly first-class: https://t.co/IOuZvEXyPgA few weeks later it was reported that Pruitt had spent some $68,000 in taxpayer funds, just on first-class flights and luxury hotel upgrades for himself, just in the six months prior: https://t.co/CFiF4aaoGuNOTE: when taxpayers weren’t paying for his tickets, he flew coach: https://t.co/MlGlXB16MxPruitt announced on March 1st that he would discontinue the practice of flying first-class, after more than a year on the job: https://t.co/0ObnCavBzFPruitt also scrapped his plan for a taxpayer-funded trip to Australia, but not before spending $45,000 of your money to fly a team of five to prepare for his arrival: https://t.co/UEyVCftNz6@EPAoig @TGowdySC Amid all of this scrutiny, the Administrator canceled a taxpayer-funded trip to Israel, showing the first hint that he knew his lavish taxpayer-funded spending on travel had crossed a line: https://t.co/xhmYiDVaM8@EPAoig The Republican chair of the House Oversight &amp; Government Reform committee @TGowdySC also sent a letter to Pruitt requesting information about his unusual taxpayer-funded travel arrangements: https://t.co/85WjjSsjQc@EPAoig We also sent a follow-up letter to Administrator Pruitt reminding him of outstanding Congressional requests tied to his first-class travel and any related ethics waivers that might have enabled it: https://t.co/WhZ0XlyDKn@EPAoig We reached out once again to the EPA’s independent investigator @EPAoig to verify that they were reviewing Pruitt’s so-called “blanket waiver” for what seemed to be unlimited first-class flights at taxpayer expense: https://t.co/0zGlRR6O6P@EPAoig Again, for a brief accounting of just some of these taxpayer-funded flights, check out this previous #thread: https://t.co/ILQVErzS6P@EPAoig This included the infamous “blanket waiver” EPA said Pruitt had been granted but which Pruitt himself continues to deny: https://t.co/hidF26lAqK@EPAoig Things got worse for Pruitt in February when reporters started to uncover his litany of expensive taxpayer-funded first-class flights and upscale hotel stays: https://t.co/meUKkkI5wfGiven this curious activity, @EPAoig again expanded their investigation into Pruitt’s possible misuse of taxpayer-funded travel: https://t.co/iKCcjFNI6m. Keep in mind that his sweetheart housing deal with an energy lobbyist with LNG clients was only revealed months laterAnd this Morocco trip, where Administrator Pruitt did little official work and veered well outside the scope of his job or the agency he leads? This one trip cost American taxpayers nearly $40,000: https://t.co/pVs1LhR1xw.EPA’s release of the Administrator's unredacted calendar for his Morocco trip showed little official work, having only disclosed a single one-hour meeting each day for two of his three travel days there: https://t.co/5hFm3EUjSh@EPAoig @EPAScottPruitt In December 2017, @EPAgov published a press release announcing that Administrator Pruitt had traveled to Morocco to promote liquefied natural gas (LNG), an issue outside the scope of EPA’s mission or the Administrator’s duties: https://t.co/n1qYXvvq65 https://t.co/YuXi4mBEy4@EPAoig @EPAScottPruitt Within days, @EPAoig confirmed that it was expanding its investigation into EPA Administrator Pruitt’s reported abuses of taxpayer-funded travel: https://t.co/DmLdV6zeP7@EPAoig @EPAScottPruitt My colleagues and I requested that @EPAoig expand their investigation at that time to include private and military plane chartering at taxpayer expense: https://t.co/jxLkobkhY8@EPAoig In late September 2017, it came out that @EPAScottPruitt had been using private planes and had even used a military jet, at a significant cost to taxpayers, to fulfill his government duties: https://t.co/2mkZirp1w7EPA’s independent investigator @EPAoig accepted the request and started looking into Administrator Pruitt's questionable travel: https://t.co/3s70EpYJDF@EPAScottPruitt Even "though a trip to Oklahoma might last three or five days, it was not unusual for only one such [informational] meeting to be listed during Pruitt's time away from Washington." When we learned of these large travel gaps, we requested an investigation: https://t.co/8pixyC3O75In a span of 3 months last year, @EPAScottPruitt was in Oklahoma for nearly half of his time "on the job." His trips home cost some $15,000, mostly at taxpayer expense. EPA reports show major gaps in the Administrator's official schedule over that period: https://t.co/6shNDA1SgaWhen he testified before Congress last week, @EPAScottPruitt said he wasn’t planning to try to undermine state clean vehicle standards.

Less than 24 hours later, we found out that might not be true. We need some answers. https://t.co/Lu22V6taroNow let's get to taxpayer-funded travel, part II of Administrator Scott Pruitt's endless list of abuses, misconduct &amp; mismanagement at @EPAgov.

For a partial rundown of his expensive flights that you paid for, start here: https://t.co/ILQVErzS6P@EPAoig @TGowdySC @GOPoversight UPDATE: @EPAoig has accepted our request for an independent review of @EPAScottPruitt's sweetheart housing deal with a top energy lobbyist: https://t.co/dYjlz1CJfv https://t.co/yAZNfuSVn8Freedoms of speech, religion &amp; expression are cornerstones of our democracy. All are threatened by Speaker Ryan firing Rev. Pat Conroy this week. Father Conroy is a faith leader of great humility and conscience whose wisdom and friendship have been a light in darkness for many.“May their efforts these days guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.” https://t.co/Wc9M1Fao2o 👏🙏✊ #conroy@EPAoig @TGowdySC @GOPoversight NOTE: Pruitt &amp; staff took a $40,000 trip to Morocco in December to push Liquefied Natural Gas exports (not in EPA's purview). 

In other news, Mr. Pruitt's former lobbyist landlord represented "the only company exporting LNG from the lower 48 states”: https://t.co/fCZN4mQbBD@EPAoig @TGowdySC @GOPoversight Lobbying disclosures recently revealed that Scott Pruitt himself met with that same lobbyist and another client in 2017: 
https://t.co/pAkbu3SWBF@EPAoig @TGowdySC @GOPoversight Mr. Pruitt told Fox News in clear terms that the lobbyist tied to his far-below-market-rate condo rental "has no clients who have business before this agency": https://t.co/MzXOvFjOaw@EPAoig A few days later @TGowdySC, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee @GOPoversight, informed the EPA Administrator that his committee had also opened an investigation: https://t.co/hvfycTxQV7At this point my colleagues and I sent a letter to the EPA Inspector General @EPAoig requesting a review of this unusual arrangement: https://t.co/qvromXyufI@EPAGov That ethics review included a copy of Pruitt's lease showing that the original landlord's name on the EPA Administrator's sweetheart condo lease was not the wife of an energy lobbyist with business before EPA, it was the lobbyist himself: https://t.co/Et7Vwb7zpj https://t.co/nzO1pJb8gh@EPAGov After Pruitt claimed that an EPA ethics official had reviewed the lease, that same official clarified that he wasn't given all the facts about the rental before he had to issue his decision: https://t.co/mhyH3CdXLDThe energy lobbyist tied to Pruitt's sweetheart apartment rental claimed at the time that he had not lobbied @EPAgov in 2017 or 2018: https://t.co/EMWfsfxOvf

(spoiler alert: he had)President Trump was asked about Mr. Pruitt's housing scandal the next day (4/3). The President responded, "I hope he's going to be great." https://t.co/EMWfsfxOvf@WhiteHouse My colleagues and I sent a letter to Mr. Pruitt formally expressing our concerns over possible conflict of interest under this special rental agreement: https://t.co/s1BjUs2xPkThe @WhiteHouse launched an inquiry into Pruitt's unusual housing arrangement with ties to a prominent energy lobbyist that same day.

That was almost a month ago: https://t.co/XWWRFWnetOOn April 2nd, we found out one of those clients had their pipeline project approved by @EPAgov at the time the Administrator was living there: https://t.co/qMeYTl55Ar@EPAScottPruitt On March 29, we learned Scott Pruitt had a sweetheart (heavily discounted) apartment rental deal with the wife of a top energy lobbyist with clients interested in @EPAgov decisions: https://t.co/2U87yeQCaTI had five minutes to question @EPAScottPruitt today about what felt like an endless list of reports of his misconduct, misuse of taxpayer funds and abuse of his position. 

Even if I had five days, I wouldn't have made it to the bottom of this swamp.

1/Delighted to join @NPRinskeep @morningedition this morning to preview today’s hearing on EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s pattern of misconduct, misuse of taxpayer funds &amp; abuse of his position. https://t.co/FxK2SFUlZfI am deeply grateful to @RepMikeTurner for his support of #HR4005: Medicaid Reentry Act. 

Bill helps states provide #Medicaid #addiction treatment 30 days before a patient leaves incarceration.

More progress tomorrow as @EnergyCommerce Health Subcommittee marks up the bill! https://t.co/0Q6CjRHDXyEarth is our home. It is our paradise, our source, the place we are born &amp; die, where we grow and learn and meet our loved ones and chase possibilities and forge memories and our faith. It deserves our thanks, our love and our respect, today and every day. Happy #EarthDay! https://t.co/5kO4cBNIsZhttps://t.co/Bq5xg62fGN8 years ago today, the #DeepwaterDisaster spill claimed 11 lives. In 6 months, some 5,000,000 barrels of oil poured into the Gulf of Mexico. We saw for ourselves the unexpected costs &amp; dangers of offshore drilling &amp; heavy fossil fuel dependence.The students participating in today's #NationalSchoolWalkout deserve to be heard. Peaceful civil disobedience is not easy &amp; often comes with consequences. They have weighed their options and are following their conscience. I am proud to join them. #NotOneMore #NeverAgainMSDInstead of trying to repeal the #ACA &amp; block grant #Medicaid, two pillars of U.S. #addiction treatment, Congress should actually work to combat the deadly &amp; worsening #OpioidEpidemic. 

Here are some potentially life-saving bills we could easily advance to a vote: https://t.co/qWX3oTMJNk"#HR3692 would build on progress made under #CARA, adding additional nursing specialists to those able to prescribe medication-assisted treatment (MAT) &amp; codifying a cap increase for the number of MAT patients doctors can treat at any given time."

More at https://t.co/p9t3uDWBwgA heartbreaking &amp; preventable tragedy. End these deadly barriers to #addiction treatment including doctor patient caps &amp; long waiting lists. Congress must pass #HR3692: Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act and any other bill that gets this done today. Lives will be saved. https://t.co/0oIdeNfLb4@nowthisnews @AdyBarkan @BeAHeroTeam During Ady’s visit to Washington, dozens of U.S. Representatives gathered in a room across from the House chamber to listen as this chair-clad champion taught us all something about our democracy.

Just like Louise, may it one day give comfort and protection to the weary, and “the greatest walnuts” to all its friends. https://t.co/byjW203YWZYes, I do wish we were talking about @EPAScottPruitt's disastrous environmental rollbacks instead of his conduct as agency head &amp; dubious ethics record. 

But he has hidden the truth &amp; changed his story too many times. He needs to be sworn in when he comes to testify next week. https://t.co/aJ798dyh6fLouise meant a great deal to many in Congress &amp; across our nation.

We miss her dearly. https://t.co/XT9CZR1bE2Mr. President, if you took the time to talk to Americans all across the country instead of just your golf buddies at Mar-a-Lago, you would hear they aren’t “seeing the benefits” and most don’t think they ever will. https://t.co/ne9AJtRunY https://t.co/V18TjRM5JnNurses are on the front lines of America’s growing #OpioidEpidemic.

Thanks to all of my constituents who shared your questions, I’m planning to ask several of them! https://t.co/JOHhTDnR3i.@EPAScottPruitt repeatedly used his position to further his own political ambitions rather than protect the lives of the American people he was appointed to serve. He has broken public trust &amp; jeopardized @EPA’s ability to do its work. He needs to resign immediately. #BootPruitt https://t.co/MjfPebl3Ex#equalpay is more than a basic family value.

In March, despite knowing he was  under scrutiny for these very hiring practices, @EPAScottPruitt quietly delivered big raises to his political aides. https://t.co/sQvV5KC4EiThis isn't new behavior. @EPAScottPruitt is the subject of THREE separate federal investigations including for possible misuse of taxpayer funds and illegal lobbying while employed as a public servant. https://t.co/V0OD8TrnElThis morning we're learning @EPAScottPruitt used an obscure provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act to sneak huge taxpayer-funded raises for two of his top political aides: https://t.co/lQ0Pwu1TIOThe EPA Administrator continues to dig himself into ethical holes, this time accepting what appears to be a discounted apartment rental from the wife of an energy lobbyist with business before the EPA: https://t.co/Je8WXD5wCKThanks for a great visit and for everything you do to strengthen our Capital Region workforce! https://t.co/UcsU6XrCg4"A few industry lobbyists may be celebrating in @epascottpruitt's apartment today, but with middle class wages flat-lining &amp; 17 of the last 18 years being the warmest on record, consumers &amp; future generations will pay a steep price for this decision."

I'm not familiar with this interpretation of "public service.".@EPA political appointees are pushing the agency to limit what data its researchers can use to study the impact of air pollution, pesticides and other chemicals on human health and the environment: https://t.co/ITWL6lfPedWhile I'm glad the President recognizes the challenge of dealing with #addiction for incarcerated individuals, our response needs to expand access to ALL forms of medication-assisted treatment behind bars.

Republicans have tried for years to strip it away. #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks https://t.co/To5uuYtJl3@BarackObama @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump The #ACA also makes insurance meaningful by guaranteeing that ALL insurance plans cover essential health benefits such as #addiction treatment, mental health support &amp; maternity care. #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks https://t.co/xuFpwqO0s2@BarackObama @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump Despite all those efforts by Republican leaders to #sabotage America's healthcare system, the #ACA still provides key preventive health services—such as flu shots, cancer screenings, and birth control—at no cost to Americans with insurance. #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks https://t.co/eZ3XqObWX9@BarackObama @HouseGOP FACT: 3 million fewer Americans had health insurance coverage after @realdonaldtrump's first year in office. The #GOPTaxScam even included a measure to #sabotage the ACA – and it's driving premiums higher for American families. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/JGiMzHSWJX@BarackObama @HouseGOP Republican leaders working to sabotage #Obamacare are targeting critical protections that keep millions of Americans, their families and our communities safe &amp; healthy. My colleagues and I will continue to #resist efforts to repeal the #ACA. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/Bo2NDNUVM7@BarackObama @HouseGOP Thanks to the #ACA, people with pre-existing conditions are no longer punished, denied coverage or discriminated against by their insurance companies. #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks https://t.co/qNqAckGTThPresident @BarackObama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010. @HouseGOP has been on a mission to #sabotage it ever since. #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks https://t.co/B8M7BGwkEDIt’s been eight years to the day since the Affordable Care Act became law. The result? Historic health security &amp; (pre-Trump) lowest-ever numbers of uninsured Americans! #ProtectOurCare #ACAworks https://t.co/qeI7W72h0x#NationalPuppyDay #FlashbackFriday https://t.co/sYkRaWgpPs@NTIAgov I also co-chair the Heritage Area Caucus and am pleased that we were able to secure $500,000 increase for Heritage Partnership Programs. Thanks to innovative public-private partnerships, each dollar we spend attracts an average of $5.50 in additional private funding.@NTIAgov Historic sites &amp; cultural centers instill in us a sense of place. They can also be important economic drivers: America’s museums spend $21 billion in their communities every year &amp; employ 400,000 Americans. We secured $3 million under this deal for the Office of Museum Services.Broadband Internet has gone from a luxury to an economic necessity. Our Capital Region still has homes &amp; businesses without this access. We worked to secure an additional $2.1 billion to expand rural broadband access and $7.5 million for @NTIAgov to improve its broadband maps.The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) helps low-income Americans improve the energy-efficiency of their homes. Democrats fought to secure $248 million for the #weatherization program, another one the President attempted to eliminate.That's in addition to securing $47 million more for the Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), a major source of cutting-edge U.S. energy research.America’s competitors around the world are spending heavily on clean energy, and we are barely keeping up. Disregarding the President’s requested cuts, we were able to add $231 million to the Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).@EPA @CDCgov Foreign interference in the 2016 election is well-documented, despite many denials by President Trump. Thankfully the President’s opinions had little to do with the outcome here, which yielded $380 million in new funding to help states protect election systems from cyber threats.@EPA This budget deal loosens the gag on @CDCgov #gunviolence research, opening a door that has been closed for more than two decades. The bill also strengthens the background check system and helps cash-strapped school systems looking to invest in greater #schoolsafety &amp; security.Thanks to Democrats, President Trump got none of his desired cuts to @EPA. Staff members at this agency work tirelessly every day to ensure pollution and contaminants can be kept out of the water we drink, the air we breathe and the soil that helps grow the food on our tables.86% of U.S. households depend on public water systems, many of which need major repairs or replacement. My colleagues and I secured $300 million in additional funding for states to repair drinking water systems &amp; $300 million more to support state-run clean water programs.We also secured $1.6b for Community Health Centers on the front lines of the #OpioidCrisis. And despite the President's proposal to cut them, Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment grants will continue to deliver lifesaving treatment to some 1.5 million individuals every year.As America’s #opioidcrisis continues to worsen, the need for a national response becomes ever more urgent. I am proud to report that my Democratic colleagues and I were able to secure $3.2 billion for programs that specifically address the #OpioidEpidemic.This bipartisan budget agreement include dozens and dozens of critical wins in other vitally important areas that will help millions of Americans. Many were opposed by President Trump and Republican leaders. They are included largely because I and other Democrats fought for them.
