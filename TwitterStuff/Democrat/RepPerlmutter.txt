Proud to be participating in the #FamilesBelongTogether rally today in Denver. The Trump administration must be held accountable for their actions and treatment of all people.
https://t.co/RGIAmH4kuuLast week, I had the privilege of coaching the Congressional women's softball team during the 10th Annual Congressional Softball Game where women in Congress play women in the press to raise money for the Young Survival Coalition. Great game and great fun! https://t.co/OuWTkx01za@spunky2637 @lawyer_moms Thanks for taking the time to meet with my office.Since '13 the @HouseGOP
has failed to pass comp. immigration reform. Now we are asking for immigration policies that don't separate immigrant families - a new low. The time is overdue for House &amp; Senate GOP to do their job and pass true immigration reform.
https://t.co/9kuAGyO6zHSo sad to hear of another incident of gun violence in one of our communities today. Thank you to the first responders on the scene. Our hearts go out to the #Annapolis community. https://t.co/z8VgKxEDrwThis is just another attempt by Republicans to discredit &amp; undermine the Mueller investigation. W/ President Trump &amp; his Republican allies working so hard to stop the investigation, you have to wonder: what are they hiding? #LetMuellerWork #FollowTheFacts https://t.co/aIFKq9JXpdWhile I did not always agree w/Justice Kennedy, I appreciate his support for marriage equality &amp; reproductive &amp; civil rights in several cases. I urge my Senate colleagues to remain vigilant of any appointee that endangers Americans’ basic rights of liberty, equality &amp; opportunity https://t.co/KCt4PX0AGiOne day of these children being separated from their parents is one day too many. We must keep the pressure on the Trump administration to make sure these families are reunited as quickly as possible.
https://t.co/VFSsokSYnRI'm disappointed in the #Janus decision. My family's business was a union shop, and I believe both business and workers succeed when everyone works together to fight for the rights of all workers. 
https://t.co/ZVIo8rMPMnThanks for taking the time to come to my office and share your story! https://t.co/ouP2lKC9n7As Coloradans, we value our open space and our public lands. We need to remain vigilant against continued attacks by the Trump Administration to roll back environmental protections and attempts to reduce access to the public lands we cherish.
https://t.co/HPXQbz6D5TThis is only the beginning. If @realDonaldTrump insists on continuing these short-sided policies, more jobs could be lost and our economy could suffer.
https://t.co/TxXdALtcB5Right now immigrant mothers and fathers are asking the whereabouts of their children and when they will see them again. But administration officials have yet to issue a plan to reunite these families. This is outrageous. We need answers immediately.
https://t.co/o9ipkvdLsD#NetNeutrality protects small businesses &amp; innovators in Colorado and across the country by ensuring they have a level playing field online. I signed the #NETNEUTRALITY discharge petition to protect #SmallBusinesses and consumers from unfair Internet practices. #SaveTheInternetToday’s #SCOTUS decision flies in the face of a core American value: religious freedom. This administration must be held accountable for their extreme and discriminatory actions even when the courts fail to do so. #NoMuslimBanEver
https://t.co/59ymHYYSDwEvery person is guaranteed due process - whether they are a U.S. citizen or not. When @realDonaldTrump talks about immigration, he seems to forget we are talking about PEOPLE. People that deserve basic decency, humane treatment...and yes, due process. https://t.co/PqtKfP59rQWe are better off when all eligible Americans can vote. But now, millions of Americans are denied this freedom. It’s time for Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE so we have a government of, by, and for the people. https://t.co/ye9siqtB6J@coschoolofmines " 'Tis a privilege to live in Colorado" - and specifically the 7th Congressional District!I signed onto this letter because we must do everything we can to ensure these families are reunited quickly and safely. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/wcx4iILuKeMake your voice heard on the 2020 Census citizenship question by August 7!

https://t.co/T5THwdt4HCIn less than 100 days, the Land and Water Conservation Fund authorization expires. Congress needs to support funding for our public lands for generations to come. Losing funding would be a tragedy for Coloradans and their families. #SaveLWCFToday, I voted against a bad immigration bill that did nothing to help Dreamers, keep families together or solve any of the immigration challenges we face. Congress should be focused on comprehensive immigration reform, but unfortunately Republican leaders aren’t interested.I stand ready to work on a comprehensive immigration package in Congress, but I will not support using children or DACA recipients as a bargaining chip for a border wall or other harmful policies. https://t.co/x10T4BSlg9 via @politicoDespite days of lies and misdirection, it is clear President Trump had the authority to stop these inhumane practices all along. The Administration must be held accountable for their actions and treatment of all people. https://t.co/LPb6239ON4This is a very sad situation. My family and I are deeply grateful for all your thoughts and prayers. As a family, we have decided to handle this as a private matter and appreciate your support. 
https://t.co/6ZmJdUt4DEThe #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct requires @DHSgov to develop policies and procedures allowing parents and children to locate each other and reunite if they have been separated. These procedures must be public and made available in a language that parents can understand. https://t.co/S0kqj5xTSnToday, after @HouseDemocrats introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, @FSCDems are going to hear from #ICE Deputy Assistant Director Greg Nevano on his agency’s efforts to separate families at the border. We need answers. #FamiliesBelongTogetherI'm proud to support this legislation to bring an end to this immoral practice. This admin has the authority to keep families together – just as other Republican &amp; Dem. presidential administrations have done in the past - yet they continue to make a choice to separate families. https://t.co/nclVf2DJEyToday, Congress should send a strong message that the U.S - a country whose story has been written by those fleeing oppression and hardship – will not abandon the world’s most vulnerable populations. I’m proud to join my colleagues in recognizing today as #WorldRefugeeDay.Regardless of party or politics, we must all work to hold President Trump and this administration accountable. I call on all my Republican colleagues to help stop this outrageous practice. #StopFamilySeparation #KeepFamiliesTogether
https://t.co/NKHzXNzeVKI'm cosponsoring legislation to end the practice of separating families. This is outrageous &amp; immoral. If the Trump admin is going to continue to choose to rip families apart, Congress must immediately pass stand-alone legislation prohibiting the practice.
https://t.co/6AbUVmC6c82,000 immigrant children separated from their parents is the direct result of the Trump administration's "zero-tolerance" policy enacted in April. @realDonaldTrump is choosing to continue to tear families apart. This is wrong.
#FamiliesBelongTogether
https://t.co/yyJ1h4vQ7RIn the first five months of FY 2018, 6 out of every 1,000 families that approached the border were smugglers. It's important we dig into these numbers and understand them thoroughly as we work to #KeepFamilesTogether.

Submit a poster or short film to the Project Mars International Art and Film Contest by August 31, 2018. https://t.co/VZDnIPZrUoThis isn't right and it's unacceptable. The practice of family separation is not required under law - the Trump administration chose to implement this cruel practice. I'm working with my Democratic colleagues in Congress to do everything possible to stop this immediately. https://t.co/bishuiSJPrOver the past 6 years, nearly 700,000 #Dreamers have been able to stay in the U.S. and contribute positively to our society.

https://t.co/WB2yQjJXiGThe world seems to be upside down when the White House is fighting with our strongest allies, such as Canada, yet acting like North Korea is our long-time friend. 
https://t.co/qPp16EU2FqI believe it's better to try and resolve conflicts by talking rather than fighting. The #NorthKoreaSummit could be a step forward but details are sparse &amp; it remains unclear what exactly was accomplished &amp; what will be accomplished in further negotiations.
https://t.co/79b3qq8ZKVThese measures make some incremental steps but do not address the need for a long-term funding solution to address the #opioid epidemic. At the same time, the Trump admin continues its attack on Americans with pre-existing conditions like opioid addiction.
https://t.co/Qm1SYrTTKLThe Trump administration's immigration policies continue to get more and more cruel. This latest decision slams the door on those fleeing serious, sometimes life-threatening, violence. This goes against everything our country stands for.  https://t.co/skj6FGlzyITwo years later, our hearts continue to ache for the 49 people lost at #Pulse Nightclub.

https://t.co/I3q3MatlI4DYK - If the wage gap were eliminated in Colorado, it would be equivalent to 8.6 months of childcare, 6.9 months of rent, or 0.7 additional years of tuition and fees for a four-year public university? #EqualPayWhen the #EqualPayAct was signed into law in 1963, a woman made just 59 cents on the dollar. Today, women earn just 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. If we continue at our current pace, the wage gap will not fully close until 2058. That is unacceptable. #EqualPay https://t.co/2jtQFT4fngOver the last three months, Trump’s reckless policies have directly affected gas prices. And since Trump took office, gas prices have jumped nearly 25%. We need to help hardworking families who are struggling to make ends meet, not make it harder on them. https://t.co/WILEnH0onoICYMI - I joined the complaint because @realDonaldTrump must comply with the Constitution and disclose any and all benefits he and/or his family businesses may be receiving from foreign governments. #NoOneAboveTheLaw

https://t.co/xnHgI7h5ZeI’m disappointed to see President Trump’s latest temper tantrum hitting the VA and jeopardizing care for our nation’s Veterans.  Yesterday’s news will likely do very little to improve the VA.  
https://t.co/3YfdApJdQUThanks to the thousands of people who participated in my Telephone Town Hall last night. I enjoyed hearing from you and discussing a wide range of topics from immigration and infrastructure to reducing gun violence. See a list of all my upcoming events at https://t.co/EJmiGA6ZFN. https://t.co/ZqA1ylvIP0Linda Brown and her family helped put an end to racial segregation in our public school system, forever transforming our society.
https://t.co/rxCLFnm8rgA final rule is still several months away but this is a step in the right direction. https://t.co/jL9uohp6TKThe last time Russian operatives and diplomats were expelled from the U.S. was in December 2016 in response to Russian interference in the U.S. presidential elections.
https://t.co/JryFR4cVLbThis past week I signed a discharge petition to bring legislation (H.R.4669) to the floor that sets restrictions on how a special counsel can be removed. @realDonaldTrump has made his opposition to the #MuellerInvestigation abundantly clear and Congress needs to be prepared.While we can all agree that firing Mueller would be a mistake for Trump and bad for our country, I’m not putting anything past this administration. We need to be prepared for the unthinkable.
https://t.co/cJorlbIZSF“When the history of the Trump era is written, it won’t be kind to this President’s enablers, and that applies to the passive enablers as well as the active ones.” Looking at you, @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP.
https://t.co/M1rnD8Yw2bFACT: In 2015, murders committed with a gun accounted for 73% of the nearly 18,000 murders in America. #EndGunViolenceThe House of Representatives has held 43 moments of silence to remember victims of mass shootings. Enough is enough. Time to act. #NeverAgainPeople all over the country will march today to say #NeverAgain. I'm proud of the students who have sparked this renewed action to #EndGunViolence. It's time for Congress to act to protect our communities.
https://t.co/48JAoALOcBICYMI - There are several good things in the funding package passed by Congress this week, including an increase in money for NREL and a small step forward for gun violence research.
https://t.co/026KTAgH0DThe #ACA helps hardworking families by guaranteeing that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits like drug addiction treatment, mental health &amp; maternity care. We need to continue to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/WQDNOtl4p5The Affordable Care Act guarantees that insurance companies cannot discriminate against Americans with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes or cancer. I will continue to fight against any effort to sabotage the #ACA.  #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/gXOYZCj0k8Russian meddling in the '16 election is a serious matter and should be treated as such. Protecting our democracy should not be a partisan issue. It's more important than ever that the #MuellerInvestigation is allowed to come to its natural conclusion.
https://t.co/z463QKlJs68 yrs ago, the #AffordableCareAct was signed into law. Since then, CO's uninsured rate has dropped to 7%. We can improve the ACA but I believe the law should remain in place so we can continue to provide access to affordable, quality healthcare for all Americans. #ProtectOurCareGiven the uncertainty facing this industry in CO &amp; across the country, securing banking and recreational marijuana protections would have provided some relief for these legitimate businesses. I'll continue to try &amp; align state &amp; federal law on this issue.
https://t.co/AgOIgCCFKrI'm relieved the government spending bill that passed the House today does not make any cuts to EERE. @NREL is one of Jefferson County's largest employers and an economic engine for the state.
https://t.co/Bhmp7swXfRThis bill was good for CO &amp; good for the 7th CD. It includes funding increases for NREL, NOAA, EPA, NASA, Head Start, Pell Grants, infrastructure, a pay raise for the military as well as additional funding to address the opioid crisis.
https://t.co/QoosJIkG1yCambridge Analytica has been on the #MuellerInvestigation’s radar since December. We need to continue to #followthefacts to get to the bottom of this.
https://t.co/ZzRQCTLCgdThis is not how an innocent or transparent administration operates. #WhatAreYouHiding #WhatAreYouAfraidOf
https://t.co/1leHqjm7V1Republicans in Congress have tried to sabotage the @EPA’s authority for years by restricting its use of science. Now @EPAScottPruitt is trying to accomplish the same thing from within the agency. https://t.co/l5MuKiUnj1We cannot allow Russia or any outside influence interfere with our elections in the future. I appreciate the work of the Senate Intel Cmte on this issue. We must work together to protect our democracy.
https://t.co/vx7QoXLm4IGreat point, Rep. Gowdy. What is Trump and his team hiding? What are they so afraid of? 
https://t.co/9GhgJYWIWRMany Colorado companies are leading the way in the aerospace industry and STEM education is the foundation of this industry. #ColoradoAerospaceWeek is an important reminder to invest in STEM education so future generations can participate in Colorado’s growing job market.Using individuals’ private data against their will or without their knowledge is unacceptable. I will be working my colleagues in Congress to get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, click below to learn how to protect your personal information. 
https://t.co/nw9sUe0MsAAnother scary and tragic morning for these students, teachers and families. Thank you to the Senior Resource Officer for your courage to intervene and for the help from all the first responders. #EnoughIsEnough #EndGunViolence
https://t.co/8jss0i9Qum.@realDonaldTrump's attacks on the FBI and attempts to undermine the #MuellerInvestigation are alarming. It also suggests Trump has something to hide. It’s more important than ever that the Mueller investigation continues. #LetMuellerWork 
https://t.co/RtlQgAkFpI.@realDonaldTrump has stocked his administration with wealthy and well-connected insiders. The foxes are guarding the henhouses. #SunshineWeek
https://t.co/Xz4tVi1CuHUSS Colorado, the most modern and sophisticated attack submarine in the world, goes in to service today. This is the fourth U.S. Navy vessel to bear the #Colorado name.

https://t.co/xR4AtO0troGreat visit with employees at @Transamerica's Denver office earlier this week. We talked about a range of issues including gun violence prevention, immigration, tariffs and cybersecurity. Keep up the good work! https://t.co/3mi3oSSviwSo sad to hear of the passing of my friend and colleague, Louise Slaughter. We will always remember her commitment to the people she served and her passion for improving the lives of hardworking Americans. https://t.co/iMoTEv643JOur economy is thriving but it has put a strain on Colorado’s housing supply and infrastructure. On 3/31, I’m hosting a housing fair to provide resources to help folks in their home search and provide information on the long-term market outlook. RSVP at https://t.co/y2Md3mA3K2. https://t.co/m9Xx5FEFrxMy office is always happy to help when we can. Thanks for stopping by our office and keep in touch! https://t.co/3gOecX0dAy"Day in and day out, month after month and year after year, we just keep asking our children to prepare for a future we’ve failed to make safe for them." That's not right. #EnoughisEnough. #EndGunViolence
https://t.co/OZmoZWjq5XIt’s about time. The actions by these Russian individuals and businesses were uncovered by the #MuellerInvestigation &amp; is an example of why the investigation should continue without political influence. #FollowtheFacts
https://t.co/r5vxIMyVb6One of my favorite people stopped by our office today - @BillNye! #Mars2033 #sciencematters https://t.co/jM8L2elI9KI'm inspired by the students in Colorado and across the country who made their voices heard today. I visited with several students on the steps of the U.S. Capitol today. I support their call to action to #EndGunViolence. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/1S54KlGRq6And to #Mars2033! https://t.co/Zd8sVWSuNy@SamMamet @CO_Municipal @CarolDodge17 @NorthglennCo Thanks for taking the time to meet!I am focused on getting this legislation passed to get cash off our streets and reduce public safety threats in our communities. Thank you for your support @SamMamet and @CO_Municipal. #copolitics https://t.co/eUekhZenGTI'm proud of the students who are making their voice heard and making a difference in the fight for action to prevent gun violence. RT to show your support for our students and say it’s time to #EndGunViolence. #EnoughIsEnough #NeverAgainICYMI - Stock buybacks are double what they were at this time in 2017. As expected, special interests and the well-connected are the biggest winners of the #GOPTaxBillScam.
https://t.co/PJNIy0xLg2As @realDonaldTrump tours his wall prototypes today, it’s important to remember that #WallsDontWork. We need to focus on comprehensive immigration reform to build economic opportunity, create jobs, strengthen our borders &amp; give undocumented Americans a pathway to citizenship.@JLaBure @LakewoodColo Great meeting with you today!Former ICE spokesman: "I’ve never been in a situation when I’ve been asked to ignore the facts because it was more convenient.” The Trump administration's actions are unprecedented and alarming. Americans deserve the facts and the truth.
https://t.co/9v1wotxDUyI signed this letter because I believe one of the first responsibilities a President has is to protect the U.S. from foreign interference in our democracy. President Trump, your refusal to impose these sanctions on Russia makes me wonder #WhatAreYouHiding? https://t.co/ZUz1aR6k2i.@realDonaldTrump has refused to hold Russia accountable for attacking our democracy. I'm cosponsoring a bill to require the administration to enforce the existing sanctions &amp; stop any further Russian meddling in our elections. #DISARMPutin #trumprussia #WhatAreYouHiding https://t.co/fKTzkoNiGQ“Do or do not.

Their determination and independence is empowering to individuals of all abilities. Team USA will compete against athletes from 45 other countries in six sport disciplines.I wrote to Secretary Ross last summer urging him to exempt household aluminum foil and aluminum container stock as they made this decision. I am concerned of the potential implications of these tariffs and the damage they could do to our economy and jobs. https://t.co/6B0XeWInR6President Trump's 2019 budget request for HUD would raise rents on families who rely on federal rental assistance, impacting roughly 1.7 million people, including 1 million children. https://t.co/0WlVnDVOqBThe significant contributions of women are seen in our communities on a daily basis. Today we formally recognize the impact &amp; achievements of women by celebrating #WomensDay.

Americans in their DNA are explorers and space exploration fuels American innovation but that investment can't be at the expense of other NASA missions or activities. https://t.co/n9Cjd2rOovThank you for joining me in support of the #MuellerInvestigation. We must continue to protect our freedom and sovereignty from future interference. That starts by understanding what Trump and his team are hiding and the full extent of the #trumprussia connection. #FollowTheFacts https://t.co/aiITPnMhkUThank you for the support! We need to pass this legislation to get cash off our streets and reduce public safety threats in our communities. https://t.co/6OBmQ7JSOP"All this time that we have had, we would have found a solution, in my opinion, and I think it's a shame that we haven't" - Rep.

https://t.co/D5kI1uxxTuToday marks the start of election season – and still @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SpeakerRyan continue to do nothing about Russian interference. We need to #ProtectOurDemocracy.SCOTUS’ temporary injunctions are no substitute for a legislative solution for #DREAMers. That's why I'm one of 196 Members of Congress who are demanding the House bring the DREAM Act up for a vote. #ProtectDREAMers@ColoradoACTE Thanks for stopping by the office. We enjoyed meeting with you!ICYMI - This is alarming and deeply troubling. The U.S. government should be doing everything it can to protect our democracy from Russian interference.
https://t.co/gKb6rAxSNbMueller is conducting a thorough investigation that is yielding results. The #MuellerInvestigation must continue w/out political influence so it may reach its natural &amp; appropriate conclusion based on the law, the facts, and the evidence. #FollowTheFacts 
https://t.co/rtm4S5lHPrSix months ago, Trump made the disgraceful decision to end #DACA, pulling the rug out from under these folks leaving them with the fear of having to leave the only life they’ve ever known. I'll continue to push for Congress to act and protect #Dreamers. https://t.co/Zwomp7U3BZExcited to see our bumper sticker make it 14,000 feet closer to Mars!

https://t.co/CnLEL1k50aPaying for college is already a tremendous challenge for many families and companies using deceptive practices are rigging the system against students. These bad actors should be identified and penalized.
https://t.co/xnXjzpDuEuCompanies are buying their own shares to bolster their stock price rather than investing in their employees, research and development or building new facilities. The #GOPTaxScam has continued to rig the system in favor of the wealthy and well-connected.
