This additional funding will not only help us meet the growing challenges of cyber threats to our national security, but will give more students from communities like the Inland Empire the chance to begin their careers in this important field. https://t.co/kRRenl1Hlf.@HouseGOP brought two partisan bills to the floor this week that proved they have no interest in reuniting families or shielding Dreamers from deportation. These problems require bipartisan solutions, and I urge my Republican colleagues to work across the aisle to solve them. https://t.co/yrv00aop1XThe Inland Empire knows all too well the tragedy that can result from an act of domestic terror. That's why I'm proud to introduce the PREVENT Act, my new bill to identify, respond to, and prevent future attacks on our communities.
https://t.co/0F5GfVIpkVI’ll continue standing with @AFSCME, @SEIU, @NEAToday, @AFTunion, @AFGENational, and the entire labor movement for workers’ right to organize so they can support their families. #Union https://t.co/uWox0bmXb3From higher wages to better health care, #Unions give a voice to those demanding change in a rigged system. This decision is a major blow to working families across the country, but we won't let it stop us from standing together for a brighter future. 
https://t.co/RhlyPDpAJMThis is why we introduced the bipartisan #USAAct with @HurdontheHill and @RepLujanGrisham. Americans are ready for Congress to step up and provide solutions to #ProtectDreamers, and we’re going to need to work together to get it done. https://t.co/gU7ApkZrfmThis bigoted policy goes against the values that make America great. We can’t allow today’s decision to deter us, and we have to keep fighting discrimination in all its forms. 
 https://t.co/tHwhDZ6mvMHead Start is a critical resource for working families in the Inland Empire. I'm proud to announce this funding which will help to ensure that every child in our community has access to high-quality early education programs.
https://t.co/1tZlBUrdtwThe opioid epidemic has hit every community across our country, including our own. I’m proud to have helped pass a bipartisan legislative package to combat this crisis.
https://t.co/z8X0l4Vc7hThanks to @HurdOnTheHill for continuing to support bipartisan solutions to modernize our border, protect Dreamers, and #KeepFamiliesTogether.Despite support from both parties, @HouseGOP just killed our discharge petition to start an open debate on DACA. This was our best chance to pass a real, bipartisan solution. Why is Republican leadership so afraid to debate bipartisan bills? https://t.co/Z6ab5ZbocPAlways great to have Inland Empire students in DC, especially when they pretend to laugh at my jokes. Thanks to @LomaLindaAcadem for stopping by the Capitol today! https://t.co/7KYQZIbuoPHappy to lend you a pen, @RepMarkMeadows. https://t.co/VcoSMql6YmI applaud this bipartisan rejection of the president's attempt to strip billions from programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's shameful that President Trump would try to cut essential services to pay for his tax cuts for billionaires. https://t.co/xQJ03BZO8GThe president's family separation policy is a violation of human rights, and I won't stand by while @realDonaldTrump continues to tear families apart. That's why my Democratic colleagues and I introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to end this policy. https://t.co/of2mNE7XrgOn #Juneteenth2018, we celebrate 153 years since the downfall of slavery in the United States. As we reflect on how far we've come, let us also reflect on how far we still have to go in the fight for equality and justice for all. https://t.co/EbG4iWbT8KThe OPPORTUNITY Act, my bill to connect a diverse pool of students with the @DeptofDefense Cyber Scholarship Program, passed the Senate last night. Thanks to @MarkWarner for helping to make sure that the US has the world's most elite cyber defense force. https://t.co/ckLa0gW7z6Nominating students from our region to attend US Service Academies is always an honor. If you know an Inland Empire student who is interested in applying to a service academy please visit my website. https://t.co/OLry7NFU4UCongratulations to Adam Gomez of Grand Terrace and David Lopez of Rancho Cucamonga, who will attend the US Naval Academy, and to Aidan Christensen from Rancho Cucamonga who will attend @WestPoint_USMA. I'm proud to have these outstanding students representing our community. https://t.co/q2en3huFgJThis Father’s Day, thousands of parents are missing their children who were ripped away by the Trump Administration. As the father of two young boys, I can only imagine the pain this policy has caused. @realDonaldTrump, reverse your cruel policy and #KeepFamiliesTogether. https://t.co/psZezcxR3kSmall businesses are the foundation of the Inland Empire economy, and microloans can play a major role in helping them succeed. I'm glad my office was able to help business owners in our community connect with this critical resource.
https://t.co/ATKcB2vSVpToday, six years after the creation of the DACA program, I joined my colleagues to say that despite President Trump’s hateful policies, we’re not giving up our fight to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/F0IX91LVuXRepublicans have a chance to claim control of this process by signing the discharge petition TODAY. Only 2 signatures are needed and we put all these bills on the floor. https://t.co/bcOZzPLbsAProud to represent @valleycollege, @UofRedlands, and #CA31 in today’s bipartisan #CongressionalBaseballGame for charity. https://t.co/DE3soYDKWIDACA recipients serving in the US military deserve to know that they’ll be able to continue living in the country they took an oath to defend. Unfortunately, Republicans voted yesterday to kill my amendment to protect these service members from deportation.https://t.co/E6tRMXtr5TUnfortunately, @HouseAppropsGOP voted to kill the amendment. I will continue fighting to ensure that DACA recipients who defend our nation through military service can continue the lives they’ve built here.
https://t.co/TYIPde4OGJEarlier this year, Secretary Mattis said that the brave DACA recipients who choose to serve our country in the armed forces would not be at risk for deportation. Today, I offered an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to codify those words. #LetDreamersServe https://t.co/yrcyF8BmRYTime’s been running out since the second the president decided to end DACA. I urge my Republican colleagues to follow Governor @JohnKasich’s advice and join our efforts to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/x8wRC5NgWOMrs. Aguilar has to do a lot of family stuff each week, but dusting off the glove and warming me up for the #CongressionalBaseballGame wasn’t on her list. https://t.co/Hf20Wl0fgYAmericans believe in standing up for the vulnerable, not sending them back into harm’s way. The kindness of the American people is not reflected by the cruelty of the Trump administration.
https://t.co/XzvaRSBKJ6We’re three signatures away from moving forward the bipartisan discharge petition on our #QueenOfTheHill rule. It’s time to get this done and #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/ZYtbUbCLH2Last year, we fought to stop @realDonaldTrump from stripping health care coverage from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. He’s trying again anyway. #ProtectOurCare
 
https://t.co/MsFZlum84wGreat to see my friend @SteveScalise back on the field! I’m usually not okay with the other team spying on our practices, but I’ll make an exception this time. https://t.co/Ksj9pNTbI5Protecting Dreamers shouldn't be a partisan issue. I'm grateful to leaders like @JohnKasich for standing with us as we work toward a bipartisan solution to this problem. https://t.co/eklkNX05VzForever grateful for the service and sacrifice of the brave service members who went into harm’s way in the name of freedom 74 years ago today in Normandy.

I’m supporting @AppropsDems amendment to ensure the IG can finish this important review. #PollutingPruitt https://t.co/Uo6NsrI7OGHad a great time answering questions about Congress from Rancho Cucamonga Middle School students this morning. Thanks for visiting me in DC! https://t.co/1StcU1g1qCThis morning AG Sessions proudly described your policy to take children from their parents at the border to deter them from entering the country to lawfully claim asylum. This is your policy and you have the power to fix it. Do the right thing. https://t.co/8flgFiTbexThis is just not true. @realDonaldTrump, this is your cruel and inhumane policy and you must take action to end it. Where are your family values? https://t.co/z4QeTNW3YlEvery American should be entitled to equal protection under the law, regardless of sexual orientation. We must pass the Equality Act to establish clear, nationwide protections for the #LGBTQ community. 
https://t.co/yNoclXxjv0Our bipartisan bill would provide Dreamers with a path to citizenship in the only country they’ve ever known as home. Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your leadership. https://t.co/k6IJ9T9OpaHappy #Pride Month! As we celebrate the #LGBTQ community, we must also continue to stand up against @realDonaldTrump’s hateful policies of discrimination. https://t.co/fyMrXsNSCAOur country was built by immigrants and our policies should reflect that. The Trump Administration must put an end to its cruel policy of separating children from their parents at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/07GWFd2unZI wrote the USA Act with @HurdOnTheHill because Dreamers deserve a chance to earn citizenship in the only country they've ever known as home. I’m proud to support this discharge petition, which only needs 5 more signatures to bring our bill to the floor. https://t.co/SL8NUy55V9Filling shelters with children who were ripped from their parents is not sound immigration policy, it’s outright cruel. We have to be better than this. 
https://t.co/Fm4tblPe0fToday we honor the service and sacrifice of those who gave their lives for our freedom.

https://t.co/1FZcSIFc6YBREAKING: The OPPORTUNITY Act, my bill to help ensure that students of color aren’t overlooked as we recruit the next generation of cyber defense experts, passed the House this morning. This is an important step as we work to reestablish US cyber dominance.https://t.co/UUtemJtuB0San Bernardino County relies on the Dept. of Transportation for critical improvements to our infrastructure. We should be focused on the career public servants who make that possible, not filling the agency with political staff. https://t.co/ieC3cX87esI’m proud that this legislation to help diverse groups of students access the @DeptofDefense Cyber Scholarship Program was adopted unanimously in the House last night as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.As global cyber threats continue to increase, we need to make sure that the US has the most advanced #CyberDefense capabilities in the world. I introduced the OPPORTUNITY Act because we can’t afford to overlook any talented students when recruiting for our cyber defense programs. https://t.co/8DXsGFdyekMy amendment would require the DoD to provide a 20-year estimate of the costs associated with updating our nuclear program, allowing Congress to perform its constitutional duty of providing oversight.

Today I signed this bipartisan discharge petition to force a vote on four potential DACA solutions because #DreamersDeserveAVote.https://t.co/lUXv9uIOPJCrazy idea: We pass legislation that leads to fewer hungry kids, not 265,000 more of them. 

The #GOPFarmBill is outright cruel. https://t.co/SytsgWfOdUHatred, bigotry and discrimination have no place in America, and we must continue working toward true equality. To the #LGBTQ community in the Inland Empire and around the country, know that I stand with you today and every day. #IDAHOT https://t.co/bNyvKM43O4Through their countless acts of bravery, we’ve seen that Inland Empire law enforcement officials are some of the best in the country. During #NationalPoliceWeek, we thank them for their service and for the sacrifices they make for our community. https://t.co/uy4ioeQWp4Local economies like ours in San Bernardino County rely on the contributions of immigrants, and this administration’s anti-immigrant agenda hurts small businesses like the ones in the Inland Empire. https://t.co/NTkp7YqwvJDreamers start businesses, raise families and pay taxes in this country, but Congress still hasn’t taken action to allow them to continue their lives here. Our #QueenoftheHill rule would change that. https://t.co/V1QAJGmsGhI had a great time teaching Mr. Grande’s senior government class at Cajon High School as the latest stop on my Job for a Day tour.

https://t.co/RW1GxFnkx3Clean up on aisle 4! Every time the president comes close to a commonsense, bipartisan compromise White House staff steps in to clean it up.

My full statement on the passage of the #GOPTaxPlan here: https://t.co/6SGaFEfJdEFrankly, there are a number of provisions in the #GOPTaxPlan that are outright cruel. Making it harder for survivors of disasters like the California wildfires to recover is one of them. https://t.co/GBakNrocfJ.@HouseGOP must allow us to vote on the #DreamActNow. The hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who have built their lives here cannot afford to put their futures on hold any longer.
