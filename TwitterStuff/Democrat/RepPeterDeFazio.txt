Congrats to @BeaverBaseball, 2018 #CollegeWorldSeries Champions! #BeaverNation https://t.co/OmNJZ6iGxiThe #Janus decision just dealt a blow to working families across the country. Unions sustain our families and make our communities stronger.  I‚Äôm proud to support unions and will continue the fight to protect workers‚Äô rights!I‚Äôm proud to support @BeaverBaseball as they compete in the #CollegeWorldSeries. Good luck in tonight‚Äôs game. #BeaverNation is behind you! #GoBeavsToday I stood with my Democratic colleagues on the House steps in protest of President Trump's cruel policy of separating families at the border. I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of the #KeepingFamiliesTogetherAct which will end this shameful practice. https://t.co/ogzwUzWbLnThe Trump administration‚Äôs #FamilySeparation policy is inhumane, immoral and will have a lasting negative effect on these children. The Trump administration can and should end it NOW. I‚Äôm fighting this policy and working to make bipartisan immigration reform a reality.Today, the @FCC‚Äôs repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect, but the fight for a free and open internet continues. The Senate has already voted to #SaveTheInternet. Proud to support similar #NetNeutrality legislation here in the House.The Trump Administration is trying to take us back to the days when insurance companies could charge more or even deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions. This lifesaving and popular provision helps more than 300,000+ in my district alone. https://t.co/UplbSwCJe1Meanwhile, Social Security is still expected to become insolvent by 2034. My legislation would keep the SS Trust Fund solvent for 60+ years and increase benefits for seniors. https://t.co/87zcaNZEnD (2/2)Our worst fears about the GOP‚Äôs attacks on Medicare are coming true: As a direct result of GOP tax cuts for the wealthy, Medicare will be insolvent three years earlier than expected, by 2026. https://t.co/waOcHdiES5 (1/2)Instead of hitting OPEC hard for manipulating oil prices, President Trump is secretly asking Saudi Arabia &amp; others to increase output. Trump MUST file a WTO complaint and hold these countries accountable for willfully violating international trade law. https://t.co/XBbSSFCwiZRegistration for the @CongressionalAC starts Monday, June 4.

Their incredible sacrifices must never be forgotten.I'm pleased that the U.S. and Canada will formally start renegotiating the Columbia River Treaty at the end of the month. Getting rid of the Canadian Entitlement would save OR ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars: https://t.co/TYtJOx60hATwenty years ago today, lives were lost and changed forever at Thurston High School, a stone‚Äôs throw from my home in Springfield. Not enough has changed since that day. We have work to do, both at home and in Congress, to address gun violence in our schools and communities.Today I introduced a bill requiring airlines, railroads, and other transportation systems to enact formal sexual harassment policies for passengers and employees. We need to keep our skies, rails, waterways, and roads safe from harassment for all Americans.https://t.co/EbxcdKYsoEWith the help of @GreenhillHumane, Myrnie and I have welcomed a new addition to our family. Everyone, say hello to Mandy!  #RescueDogs https://t.co/U6YHYRRGMEThe Senate just passed a bill to restore #NetNeutrality and keep  the internet open, free and fair for everybody. Now the bill heads to the House, where I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill. #SaveTheInternetDuring the campaign, Trump promised he'd  lower Rx drug prices. Today, he announced a proposal that does nothing to address drug pricing, but sends drug company stocks soaring: https://t.co/a2fx1hNacdThe Trump Administration has scrapped the CFPB's Office for Students and Young Consumers -- the only office in the ENTIRE federal government devoted to protecting student loan borrowers. There's truly no limit to how low Trump will go in order to protect his corporate cronies.While far from perfect, the #IranDeal was negotiated by a broad coalition of our allies and moved us towards the goal of keeping Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Today, we heard Trump offer many criticisms but no solutions to fill the void left by the U.S.'s exit.New data shows the Trump Administration's 1st quarter trade deficits with Mexico and China are the largest on record. Trump was elected by promising to overhaul our broken trade policies - We've seen nothing but bluster for the past 16 months. Another day, another broken promise.Got a big thank you from crewmembers Ursula, Susan, Lorretta and Barbara from @AlaskaAir, photographer Veda, and @AFA_CWA for including a requirement in last week's #FAA bill that flight attendants get at least 10 hours of rest time between duty periods.‚úãüèªü§öüèª https://t.co/k5mAHgnAJNI just introduced a bill banning any paper products imported from countries that refuse to meet the U.S.'s high environmental standards. It's only fair that our trade partners follow same standards that U.S. producers adhere to.Quarterly reports are in, showing that the #GOPTaxScam was a huge gift to Wall Street--the U.S. is borrowing $20 BILLION to pay for massive handouts to the biggest banks: https://t.co/t0ZwNBBlf0With climate change-deniers like President Trump and Scott Pruitt at the helm, it's more important than ever before to do all we can to protect and preserve our planet for future generations #EarthDay2018Visiting the beautiful South Coast today! https://t.co/nq9aFst8jmWelcomed my colleagues @RepGarretGraves and @RepHuffman to Coos Bay today.

Let‚Äôs take action and stand up for American consumers: https://t.co/VnzZefMQHnEven Defense Secretary Mattis urged President Trump to seek congressional approval before the recent strikes in Syria. It‚Äôs beyond time for Congress to stand up to the presidency and defend its war powers granted in the Constitution. #VoteOnWar https://t.co/4znqAnsMmLAfter working with BLM and Coos County for many years, I‚Äôm pleased to announce Bastendorff Beach will be transitioning to a day use only site. This is great news for the Coos County residents and will make the beach safer for locals and visitors alike. https://t.co/egyMnhxOJpThousands of young Oregonians are struggling with student loans, yet the GOP is slashing student aid. I've introduced legislation to make it easier for young people to attend and pay for vocational schools, community colleges, and 4-year universities: https://t.co/eTpxg8eBelRejoining the TPP would be a disastrous about-face. We ought to be moving away from the failed trade policies of the past and working towards a fair trade plan that would protect both workers and consumers.

https://t.co/8nluSsVSPaOn average, women are paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. For women of color, the #wagegap is much larger. This is not just a women‚Äôs issue. It impacts our families, businesses, &amp; economy. We need the #PayCheckFairnessAct now! #EqualPayDay https://t.co/ScpGFWxlxRI'm glad the Omnibus spending bill will include a much-needed funding fix for wildfire suppression. Wildfires will be treated, and paid for, just like any other natural disaster, so that the Forest Service can direct funds to forest maintenance and fire prevention.Last fall President Trump called elephant trophy hunting 'terrible'; This week, he's lifting a ban on importing elephant tusks.  What a disgraceful flip-flop. 
 
https://t.co/fltwLe5TgfHad a good and productive meeting with the interim VARHS Director Dave Whitmer. He briefed me on positive changes being made to improve management and patient care across the VA healthcare system in SW Oregon. Pleased to see real change happening. https://t.co/hNcKFPjH2L"The tax bill was sold as a way to create jobs and boost stagnant wages.

They deserve a level playing field. #SaveTheInternetI am joining 149 of my colleagues in cosponsoring legislation that will #SaveTheInternet.#NetNeutrality means consumers ‚Äî not big corporations‚Äî choose what websites and applications we see online. #SaveTheInternetThree months after President Trump signed the #GOPTaxScam into law, the results are in -- Investors and wealthy shareholders are reaping tremendous financial benefits while working families get very little: https://t.co/XDRgUBN7XwI visited the Eugene airport today to check out the brand-new TSA PreCheck lane and also got to visit the control tower. We need to ensure that TSA has the funding it needs to ensure that our airport runs as safely and efficiently as possible. https://t.co/EkGwlLOGvOOn February 14, 1859, Oregon joined the union.

https://t.co/EfpoeA0fTM https://t.co/QmgwpIxQuEValentine‚Äôs Day is one of the biggest tip days for workers, but President Trump is proposing a rule allowing employers to pocket worker‚Äôs tips - nearly $6 BILLION each year. Please SHARE if you believe workers should be able to keep their hard-earned tips! #ProtectOurTips https://t.co/1tt15q2c38Wall Street is gearing up for another party over the still-unreleased Trump infrastructure scam. Instead, we should be advancing Democrats‚Äô plan for #ABetterDeal to Rebuild America &amp; create jobs. https://t.co/OvK6yk7FM1This Just In: Moody's says the U.S. AAA credit rating is under "downward pressure" thanks to the massive national debt increase caused by the #GOPTaxScam: https://t.co/Aq3yuM4qGZPresident Trump has repeatedly promised to shrink our trade deficit with China. It just hit a record high. I'm tired of all this winning, aren't you?A PA woman sees $1.50 increase in her weekly paycheck. Compare that to people who earn more than $500k, who will see $400+ each week. Everyone's share of the massive deficit created by the #GOPTaxScam is $4,600. Does Speaker Ryan think that's fair?While President Trump shilled for the #GOPTaxScam and celebrated massive tax cuts for the wealthy today in Ohio, the Dow dropped more than 1500 points. He takes credit for its rise -- when do you think we'll hear him take credit for its fall?Devin Nunes has made it clear that he cannot remain non-partisan in his role as House Intel Chairman. I'm calling on Speaker Ryan to immediately remove him from his position &amp; ensure the Ethics Committee begins a thorough investigation into the misuse of his leadership role. https://t.co/EGPu6FmtmsPresident Trump loves to brag about his accomplishments -- I wonder when  we'll hear about the "tremendous" drop in the Dow (665 points) and the "HUGE" effect it'll have on the economy.This week, I read the controversial memo authored by House Intel Chairman Nunes. While I cannot go into details about the contents, I can say that it was a highly-partisan document that compromises national security in order to protect President Trump: https://t.co/Yfu32o69j7My statement on the resignation of VARHS Director Doug Paxton: https://t.co/YxqRdL0vo7I was disappointed with President Trump's pandering, platitudes and props in tonight's #SOTU.

The GOP needs to get their act together, do their job, and properly fund the government for an entire year: https://t.co/n1gg9EuFAdIf House GOP is *actually* worried about the Children's Health Insurance Program, why have they let it remain unfunded since September? ü§î22,000 individuals apply for Social Security and Medicare every day -- but their applications will be delayed until the #TrumpShutdown ends. President Trump, it's time to stop watching TV and do your job to end this Republican logjam.The most basic function of the majority party -- particularly one that controls the House, Senate and White House -- is to write a budget that keeps the government open. GOP, you're 113 days late and it‚Äôs harming transportation, job creation and troop readiness: https://t.co/kw9T14Gf51The #TrumpShutdown is already impacting thousands of Oregonians - Community Health Centers, which serve 30,000 in Lane County alone, are unfunded. GOP leaders MUST stop pointing fingers and find a solution to this mess.President Trump's party controls the House and the Senate. It's up to them to end the #TrumpShutdown.The 'Master Negotiator' asked Congress for a bipartisan deal, which was delivered to him last week. He rejected it. The number one person at fault for this #Shutdown is Trump himself. #TrumpShutdownWe cannot continue to run the government on a month-to-month budget. Republicans' refusal to work across the aisle has led us to the #TrumpShutdown -- it's well past time for them to come up with bipartisan solutions.A government #shutdown is beyond irresponsible: While GOP leaders scramble to find a solution, the U.S. stands to lose trillions in lost revenue, thousands of workers wait to find out if they will be furloughed, and people lose confidence in their government. https://t.co/oV4U0Cw6ePGlad to welcome Eugene Mayor Lucy Vinis, Springfield Mayor Christine Lundberg, and reps from Lane County here in DC today.

This bill rights a historic wrong and is a tremendous accomplishment for the Cow Creek, Coquille, and the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw.Association Health Plans sound great, but the truth is they are bare-bones plans that don't offer true coverage &amp; raise premiums for all. This was attempted before, and failed miserably, leaving 400k with $123m in unpaid claims. https://t.co/db8sLhbKViMy full statement on AG Sessions' announcement today: https://t.co/AOjc5NSpWC https://t.co/Ahz9YSFfSFThe president launched another reckless outburst at North Korea‚Äôs leader.

I've requested an investigation into the alarming reports coming out of the Roseburg VA and have repeatedly called for reforms in our VA system to ensure veterans are getting the care they deserve. https://t.co/npYmib1P9uHappy New Year! 2017 was a busy year - I'm looking forward to another year representing SW Oregon in Congress: https://t.co/dkjiIcsPV8Congress has finally passed my bill, the Western Oregon Tribal Fairness Act, that gives sovereignty over tribal land back to the Coos and Cow Creek Tribes and allows the Coquille Tribe to manage their forest lands the same way as all other tribal forest lands.It's a dark day: the House just passed a massive tax bill that gives trillions in giveaways to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. This is just another example of shameful 'trickle-on' economics, and working Americans deserve better. https://t.co/T1mPs05dIjApparently the first time wasn't bad enough. We just heard the just-passed #GOPTaxScam violates Senate rules. It has to be changed and come back to the House AGAIN for another vote tomorrow.

This is not only irresponsible legislating, it's bad for America. #GOPTaxScamWe‚Äôre witnessing a much-needed sea change in society in which sexual harassment and abuse of power is no longer tolerated: https://t.co/uXtAxeKPOnNorth Korea has launched another missile, and all President Trump can do is continue to escalate tensions.
