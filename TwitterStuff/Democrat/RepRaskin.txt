This Orwellian policy is fine for an authoritarian regime, not so much for the greatest liberal democracy that ever existed.The White House wants to erect tent cities to house unaccompanied children. More than 1,000 children could be forced to live in makeshift tents as they are separated from their families. Is this America?More than 1,300 kids, some as young as two years old, have been pulled apart from their families and sent God-knows-where. @RepJayapal saw mothers who “could not stop crying.” We must have a hearing about what is taking place in the name of the American people.The Statue of Liberty quotes Emma Lazarus’ poem: “Give me your tired, your poor. Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.” Trump adds: “and then we’ll separate them from their children.”Many families arrive in America fleeing domestic violence, gang violence, &amp; gov't oppression. Many parents arrive at lawful ports of entry &amp; yet are still separated from their kids. This is America, a “haven of refuge,” as Paine put it, for people fleeing oppression &amp; violence.Many parents being separated from their children have arrived with valid asylum claims at lawful ports of entry. Yet they are treated like criminals. Why are their kids being ripped away from them when they have not even had “credible fear” hearings on their asylum petitions?Has it not always been the practice of the Judiciary Committee that Members can be recognized to speak to matters of justice important to the people of the United States? Thanks @RepJayapal for your first-hand account of a shameful policy.Chairman Goodlatte tried to stop Members of the House Judiciary Committee from addressing Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy that has separated hundreds of children from their parents at the border. But we won’t accept a gag rule on this scandalous policy; we will be heard. https://t.co/VSlSQUgPNmNational security leaks are generally investigated by the FBI, not CBP.

Our letter: https://t.co/bD2dP8m9ayCelebrating the trashing of the Iran agreement along with Trump are the theocratic oligarchs of Saudi Arabia, who repress religious freedom, promote Wahabiist extremism, jail dissenters and wage bloody war in Yemen. https://t.co/8QgOxhAsOITrump’s bull-in-the-china-shop routine with the Iran nuclear agreement undermines reformist forces in Iran and strengthens the hard-line theocrats describing us as a rogue nation. People seeking human rights want peace, not war. https://t.co/brrXs4yQ7WBy walking away from the JCPOA, Trump makes it easier for Iran to develop nuclear weapons.  What a dreadful decision. He’s responsible for the consequences. #IranDealWithout the #IranDeal’s rigorous inspection regime, Iran could resume its illegal nuclear weapons program. Pulling out of the #IranDeal is dangerous, reckless and provocative.More stormy weather in the world. President Trump alone bears responsibility for the consequences of this dangerous decision to pull the plug on the #IranDeal.President’s foolish decision to walk away from #IranDeal makes it easier for Iran to get a bomb &amp; undermines American credibility on the world stage. @realDonaldTrump has unleashed yet another crisis.I join fellow members of the House Public Education Caucus in celebrating teachers and educators around the world.

Proud of our bipartisan work in Congress to protect press freedom. #WorldPressFreedomDay https://t.co/0QhGHSCNiYThe U.S. is sinking in world press freedom rankings as the President denounces the media as “the enemy of the people.” On #WorldPressFreedomDay, we recommit ourselves to a democratic society where a free and open press is the people’s best friend. https://t.co/FV1RkmLlZ5Adding his voice to the chorus of unreason &amp; prejudice in the world, Mahmoud Abbas gave a sickening &amp; unacceptable speech filled w/ anti-Semitic canards &amp; propaganda. His deranged address does nothing to serve the cause of peace in the Middle East. https://t.co/feQfhUwbdNMaryland is home to 570,000+ small businesses and more than 1 million #smallbiz employees.

That's why I introduced the Stop Access to Firearms Evading Revocation (SAFER) Act. #SAFERAct https://t.co/iRN5kK1Lt5The recent massacre in Nashville demonstrates the urgent need for the #SAFERAct, which would make sure that state gun ownership laws are enforced. The alleged shooter, Travis Reinking, had his Illinois FOID revoked after multiple run-ins w/ law enforcement. https://t.co/c7qa5GU9W7Just introduced the #SAFERAct to make it illegal to knowingly transfer or return a firearm to a person whose state license to possess or purchase firearms has been revoked or whose firearms were seized by the state. https://t.co/iRN5kK1Lt5 https://t.co/C6PVUroqV9Proud of the 24 Blair Blazers selected to represent Maryland at the @YMCA’s Conference on National Affairs, which brings together youth delegates from across the country interested in government and public policy. https://t.co/CcMQtRVl6PSolidarity with allies who #LightItUpBlue during #AutismAwareness Month to advance greater acceptance of people in the autistic community. https://t.co/QdP7mzATVdThe Judiciary Cmte hearing on Social Media Filtering Practices &amp; Free Speech is underway.

His message is to ditch authoritarianism and the Alt-Right and stand up for strong democracy and human rights.By the end of Macron’s speech calling for human rights, democracy, science and the rights of minorities, the GOP is going to go back to calling French Fries Freedom Fries.Vive la France, Vive la Revolution. Macron called for a new “global community” and “strong multilateralism” to resist fascism and terrorism and defend democracy and freedom. https://t.co/40QACIvhmH
