Latest SCOTUS ruling in favor of fake women's health centers is dangerous to women's health and the future of reproductive rights. https://t.co/TBvFhTWQqRTrump made it clear that this was a #MuslimBan &amp; SCOTUS shamefully upheld it. Make no mistake, history will look on this moment of court-sanctioned discrimination as a shameful retreat from our values. 

This is not the legacy to leave our children. https://t.co/Hk55em3QcQDue process should never be contingent on one's immigration status, and Trump's dehumanizing attacks on immigrants, asylum seekers, and the Constitution is un-American and dangerous. https://t.co/9FRpxYtCrTUsing separated migrant children as leverage to force their parents into a ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô deportation is utterly disgusting and runs contrary to our values.

To label it a mere political opinion is dangerously irresponsible and does nothing to address the very real threat it poses to our planet. https://t.co/C1LM29NqnpBoth the Goodlatte/McSally bill &amp; Ryan 'compromise' bill are nothing more than the same recycled Republican ideas that criminalize immigrants, waste billions of dollars on a ridiculous border wall, and militarize border communities. https://t.co/2F1L1YBelmMake no mistake, yesterday's executive order was a spectacle befit for a reality star President. Replacing family separation with indefinite family detention is no way to solve this crisis, and nonexistent plans to reunite families is unacceptable.  https://t.co/IU97rE9hjoTrump is just replacing a family separation crisis with a detention one. The jailing of children-even with their parents-is wrong. My message to the President: Children and asylum seekers are not criminals. 
https://t.co/ziQFL8wneDBy holding children hostage for a draconian anti-immigrant bill, @realDonaldTrump has reached a new low. 

As a father and grandfather, I'm sickened by the family separation policy, and I demand for Trump to bring this cruel, inhumane practice to end. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/X7gFhyuhZPStarting the press conference now to tell the Trump Administration to stop üëèüèΩ separating üëèüèΩ families üëèüèΩ at üëèüèΩ the üëèüèΩ border. This administration‚Äôs victimization of children is disgusting, abhorrent, and must stop now. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/ggi1P5RgdqI‚Äôm disgusted by Trump‚Äôs inhumane policies that are separating families at the border. That‚Äôs why I took two guests with me to the House floor today to make the point loud and clear: End this policy, protect children, and #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/PHqxdkp5QW"We are still working through the process," is an unacceptable answer when it comes to reuniting children with their parents. Trump must end this policy NOW and immediately begin reuniting families he separated. https://t.co/A5UDmfdrITTrump's no stranger to disgusting rhetoric, but his attempts to blame all immigrants for crime and characterizing them as an 'infestation' is low-even for him.

More info here: https://t.co/GF9k8Ztelk https://t.co/zZLWc67yVAUsing innocent children and asylum seekers as leverage to get a border wall? Nothing's too low for Trump.

We are better than Trump's dehumanizing policies. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/1V0extqeEB#PrideMonth is about visibility for our #LGBTQ brothers &amp; sisters.

Listen for yourself and hear the consequences of 'zero-tolerance.' https://t.co/oNGm9LZ5sE #KeepFamiliesTogetherRipping children from their parents at the border is not a partisan issue. It's a battle for the very heart and soul of our nation. Trump must stop this egregious assault on asylum seekers and start reuniting families. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/B9wf5JEUQYOne consequence of Trump's disastrous border policy: Some parents are deported back to their home country WITHOUT their child. A reminder of why 'zero-tolerance' really is 'zero-humanity'. https://t.co/JalCzaUs8VLet's be clear about the tragedy at the border: It is completely manufactured by Trump and is a direct consequence of HIS policies.

#FactCheck: There is no law that requires family separation at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/rASmZVRFZjTell that to the 2000 children separated from their families.

Donald Trump-not Congress-is the ONLY person who has the power to end the family separation policy immediately and stop subjecting vulnerable asylum seekers to unimaginable trauma. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/6IUN02Z3NzMaybe @SpeakerRyan will do something about the 2000 children who have been separated from their families at the border and are spending #FathersDay in detention?

The only person responsible for the tragedy at the border is Donald Trump.

There is no law that requires the Trump Admin. to brutally separate families at the border. 

Donald Trump is the ONLY person responsible for this reprehensible policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/MozUQVTFDAEach day, a new horror story comes out of the border, and each day we redouble our efforts to fighting for justice.

Period. https://t.co/FhUZHRU0h1This recording of a mass trial at the border is horrifying. 'Zero-tolerance' policies have separated families without any clear plan in place to reunify them. Heartless policies from a heartless administration hell-bent on cruelty. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/FQ58V6i7AdTrump and his complicit henchmen may be ok with separating children from their families at the border, but I‚Äôm not. I refuse to be a bystander to this assault on our values, and I‚Äôll keep fighting for families. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/a8dpUohCHOOur country is better than the policies of the Trump administration.

When it comes to Pruitt and his unethical behavior, #EnoughIsEnough.

Increasingly, more and more immigrants with no criminal convictions are falling victim, leaving broken families behind in their wake. https://t.co/hYsZ9AnzMOMake sure to tune in today at 2pm for our briefing on Supplemental Security Income. You can follow the conversation on my Facebook page: https://t.co/WpNLAQPRbV https://t.co/LcqrFwoYHs.@HouseGOP will do anything to please their wealthy donors, even if it means paving the way for another Wall Street Crash. I remember the devastation of 2008 and will be voting against the #BankLobbyistAct so that we can #ProtectConsumers. https://t.co/G0PLQ30lAbUnder the #GOPFarmBill, almost 40,000 children in Arizona could lose their access to free school lunches. 

It's unacceptable to increase food insecurity in our communities. I'm voting "No" and standing up for working families, seniors, and students. https://t.co/6fnhm4ofNNTune it tomorrow at 2pm ET for a Facebook Live briefing on Supplemental Security Income. Follow the conversation on my Facebook page https://t.co/WpNLAQPRbV https://t.co/NrRmE6hgmfHaven‚Äôt sent your RSVP yet to Boots To Books? You still have time! Join me, @RepSinema, VA officials, and student veterans groups on Saturday at the University of Arizona and learn how you can make your transition from the military to college a success! https://t.co/pR9EfE5X8MWe know Scott Pruitt is corrupt, but you know what's worse than wasting taxpayer money on first-class flights, 24/7 private security &amp; a secret phone booth?

Sacrificing important public health protections in the name of profits for his corporate pals. https://t.co/6AcVe7FLfRThe GOP #FarmBill will negatively impact our environment while ripping benefits away from over 280,000 Arizonans. That's why I voiced by opposition on the House floor. #ProtectSNAP https://t.co/qZj1wBnqhTThe GOP #FarmBill will be devastating for Arizona's working families. Programs like #SNAP help the working poor to lift themselves out of poverty and put food on the table. I'm saying #NoHouseFarmBill because I believe we must #protectSNAP. https://t.co/hTVniRGVe6Shameful rhetoric from a shameless man. Trump supports separating children from parents at the border, put the lives of 800,000+ people in limbo when he ended the #DACA program for no reason, and now looks to dehumanize immigrants even further. https://t.co/XqKYYVOQOLActions like these are faced by our #LGBTQ brothers and sisters daily. We should not let fear and systemic oppression fuel discrimination and hate, but advocate for inclusivity and acceptance instead! #IDAHOT  https://t.co/IhUxWe1M95Missed us at the SAVAHCS Resource Fair and Town Hall today? No problem! 

Give one of our caseworkers a call if you're a veteran and need help with a federal agency. I'm committed to ensuring that all our veterans have the healthcare &amp; benefits they deserve.  #AZ03 https://t.co/YoLACn381cCongratulations to the Nogales High School baseball team on a historic win this week, making them back-to-back state champions for the first time in over 60 years! #AZ03 is proud of you! https://t.co/5cHsEnqGdvLet's bring this fight back to the House and #SavetheInternet. It's the people-not corporations-who should choose what we see online, and I'm ready to vote to save #NetNeutrality https://t.co/WlGOTUzoPLExotic animals have no reason to be trotted out as a spectacle at a high school prom. I introduced HR 1759, the Traveling Exotic Animal and Public Safety Protection Act to restrict the use of exotic &amp; wild animals in traveling circuses &amp; exhibitions. https://t.co/oR5eVpBqjRConsumers--not big corporations-- should choose what websites and applications we see online. Senate Democrats vote today to #SaveTheInternet, and I‚Äôm supporting the same #NetNeutrality legislation in the House. https://t.co/r7wCcQfxRMWhy do we send our teachers to educate our children without properly equipping them with the tools necessary for success? 

It's time to increase educational funding and provide our teachers the best tools possible and resources to serve our students. https://t.co/9wT01aJiOLSabotaging healthcare for millions of American families and children is not my idea of making America great. 

We should be passing solutions that expand healthcare access and affordability, not looking for ways to leave people without coverage. https://t.co/AGypOZyqRIBetween opening the doors of the EPA to industry interests, to limiting scientific analysis in critical public health research, Pruitt's EPA is a disgrace. 

Politics should never come before the health and well-being of American families. #BootPruitt https://t.co/QCrcg2E8ZGDiverse viewpoints and backgrounds bring new perspectives that will only help tech companies become more successful and better serve their consumers. Why aren't companies doing more to increase #DiversityInTech? https://t.co/Fb0lglbdVGAccording to Billionaire Betsy and her for-profit college cronies, it‚Äôs the for-profits who need more protections than students.

Our students deserve better than an Education Department that seeks to help the very institutions that have defrauded them. https://t.co/SOOMn5lzVnLooks like the #GOPTaxScam isn't responsible for today's economy.

One-time bonuses are merely a distraction from the massive amounts of money that are lining the pockets of corporate shareholders while our workers are left with nothing. https://t.co/pYhfoMcc2gMaking the transition from combat to the classroom brings with it a unique set of challenges. We‚Äôre partnering with @RepSinema to help our veterans, servicemen and women, and their family members navigate this transition and make the best decisions for their futures. https://t.co/HuPyzNSFbiThe Trump administration‚Äôs proposed ‚Äòpublic charge‚Äô rule is a dangerous attack on immigrant families. I‚Äôm proud to join @RepEspaillat, @RepZoeLofgren, and 80 other colleagues to express our opposition to this heartless policy. https://t.co/0DHhP1MuL8I am thrilled to announce Fernanda Silva Mendoza of Tucson High School as the winner of the 2018 Congressional Art Competition. Her piece, entitled ‚ÄúDreamers‚Äù will represent #AZ03 and hang in the U.S. Capitol for one year. https://t.co/WSwvLJdiwZ.@realDonaldTrump has no idea how the border works. Millions of jobs and livelihoods depend on a strong economy on both sides of the border. It‚Äôs ridiculous to think you can solve border issues by simply shutting it down. https://t.co/vc7qrXC5OgImmigrants shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between the health of their families and their future in this country. However, under a new Trump proposal, they may be forced to make this impossible decision. It‚Äôs heartless, it‚Äôs cruel &amp; it doesn‚Äôt reflect our values. https://t.co/AvVh7scvdxYou can erase references to #ClimateChange all you want, but it doesn‚Äôt stop it from impacting our national security. #ClimateChangeIsReal and we should be doing more, not less, to protect our communities and country from its negative consequences. https://t.co/fYFQgX6HsOIt‚Äôs always great when #AZ03 students come to Washington to get a first-hand experience with federal government. Thanks to the students of Southgate Academy for stopping by today! https://t.co/l0EdmLg5OTAre you a veteran, a current servicemember, or part of a military family? Are you looking to transition to community college or a university? Come out to our ‚ÄúBoots to Books‚Äù event in Tucson next week and learn how you can make your college dreams a reality. https://t.co/DT7jgaOStZTribes are sovereign nations and states have no right or legal precedent to interfere in the government-to-government relationship between tribal &amp; federal govt. Shame on the Trump admin for failing to recognize our federal trust responsibility to tribes. https://t.co/GUGgZIQoDhGina Haspel's questionable role in illegal torture programs should disqualify her from serving as the CIA Director. That's why I joined my colleagues in the house to urge the Senate to #BlockHaspel. https://t.co/Wgzc4GqSt7 https://t.co/xKQadqqjOrAs Puerto Rico recovers from Hurricane Maria, it‚Äôs unconscionable that nearly 450 public schools are facing closure. I joined 31 of my colleagues to send a letter to Governor Rossell√≥ expressing our opposition to this policy. https://t.co/e1OgLowHHh#NetNeutrality means consumers‚Äînot big corporations‚Äîchoose what websites and applications we see online. That's why I‚Äôm supporting legislation to #SaveTheInternet, and today in the Senate they‚Äôre one step closer to a vote next week. https://t.co/HrhXmNc7N0 https://t.co/qyL1e3pemVAs #ClimateChange increases the amount of heat content in the ocean, storms are becoming stronger and deadlier. Meanwhile, Trump and his climate change deniers are busy scrubbing any mention of climate science from government websites.  https://t.co/cDf2uRS1YKDespite protests from senior diplomats at the State Department, Trump and his cronies still moved forward with ending #TPS and will now send back 300,000+ immigrants to dangerous situations. https://t.co/cO6JJuPHqAIt‚Äôs abhorrent that those who are willing to lay down their lives for our country are faced with deportation when they return home. I‚Äôm speaking at today‚Äôs deported veterans forum to highlight their stories and stop this practice from occurring. https://t.co/ea15aAtmuvI urge the Trump administration to improve upon the current #IranDeal, pursue a path of diplomacy with Iran, and work towards solutions that improve global peace and security. #DiplomacyWorksKilling the #IranDeal will further inflame tensions in an already volatile region, embolden Iran to begin the production of nuclear weapons, and severely weaken our global influence and credibility.With the stroke of a pen, Trump ignored top diplomats, heads of state of our closest allies, leading experts, and findings from the IAEA that validate that Iran is successfully complying with the #IranDeal. https://t.co/JiRVnOXr6UIt's sickening to see the way that the Trump administration continues its inhumane targeting of vulnerable immigrant families fleeing violence. Separating immigrant families at the border is an egregious assault on American immigration norms and values. https://t.co/INI7bCupNXIt‚Äôs downright shameful. Congressional Republicans increased the deficit to give tax cuts to corporations and their wealthy pals with their #GOPTaxScam, and now they‚Äôre looking to cut funding for children‚Äôs healthcare to make up the difference. https://t.co/3NfEbU4V0HDiversity and inclusion must be a priority in all of our schools. With only 39 percent of Native students completing their bachelor's degree, this incident should be a wake-up call for academic institutions to provide adequate support for Native students. https://t.co/UnkGTL2nqLSince he's become President, Trump's nativist policies have ended #TPS for vulnerable immigrants, put the lives of #DACA recipients in limbo, and sought limits to legal immigration. Despite these attacks, we will never cease to be a nation of immigrants. https://t.co/QhiJOBEkhhAnother day, another ethical mishap by #PollutingPruitt. This time: Expensive foreign trips and promoting the interests of his corporate lobbyist pals. 

When will enough be enough for Trump's #CultureOfCorruption? It's time for Pruitt to go. https://t.co/DnvLzZJRPeTrump just put the lives of more than 57,000 Hondurans at risk by forcing them back to unimaginable violence and hardship. To our Honduran brothers and sisters: I hear you, I see you, and I won‚Äôt stop fighting for you. https://t.co/wba02V3BryIt‚Äôs Housing Week of Action and I‚Äôm proud to support affordable housing that provides shelter, increases access to economic opportunity, and creates a sense of community for all Arizonans. #OurHomesOurVoices https://t.co/BlUujRDYKPPunishing parents who are trying to save their children‚Äôs lives, and punishing children for being brought to safety by their parents by separating them is fundamentally cruel and un-American, yet apparently acceptable under current Trump policy. https://t.co/s76rL46vvADuring Senior Corps Week, I want to thank over 700 Arizona seniors, and thousand more nationwide, who are serving their communities. It's never too late to make a difference! #SeniorCorpsWorks https://t.co/kCFs2yhfDFHistory lesson for @VP: Arpaio was found in contempt of a court order that banned him from racially profiling Latinos he thought were undocumented immigrants. A complete disregard for the legal system is not what I would call championing the rule of law.

https://t.co/POHQ2kt0L5The United States has an obligation under domestic and international law to consider requests for asylum. 

Despite what Trump saw on TV during 'executive time', these migrants aren't criminals, but human beings fleeing unimaginable danger. https://t.co/zEMzsLRIFeSmall businesses want to see their taxes simplified, but does the #GOPTaxScam help? #SpoilerAlert: No.  

Only 7% of small businesses who thought they‚Äôd benefit from the law say that it will make filing takes easier. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/td1zzCflaFPublic education opens the doors of opportunity to our students, yet historic under-investments in education by the AZ legislature are making that virtually impossible. I support our teachers and greater investments in public education.   https://t.co/xr4pfBsSSMMay is National Foster Care Month. As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I am proud to renew my commitment to ensuring that every child has the safe, loving family they deserve #FosterYouthVoices https://t.co/7idXYnZ8iFI'm tired of watching #PollutingPruitt put the health of our communities at risk by dismantling important public health protections so that his corporate pals can profit. It's time for Pruitt to go. #BootPruitt https://t.co/kVosRlpBPEOne of the biggest problems with Trump's offensive immigration diatribes: They're not based in sound research. Most scientists &amp; researchers agree. Immigration is an asset for the American economy. https://t.co/QSCGFPr2hMTrump once again refuses to treat immigrants 'with heart' in this latest decision. The lives of 9000 Nepalese are being upended, even as their country struggles to rebuild after a devastating earthquake. https://t.co/zItxk8NKeA#PollutingPruitt's EPA actions come from another nefarious industry's playbook: Big Tobacco. For years, tobacco companies publicly fought against science proving the harm of tobacco, similar to Pruitt's crusade in targeting our public health protections. https://t.co/mKB6ohaJQETeachers are fed up with the education status quo in Arizona. They're tired of watching corporations get tax cuts while their budgets get slashed and they're asked to do more with less. I support AZ teachers and call for greater investments in public ed.  https://t.co/MrT6d7cW2D#VaccinesWork to give life-long protection from #polio to every child! Over 400 million children are vaccinated each year to #EndPolio, and we are closer than ever to eradicating the disease completely. @ShotAtLife  https://t.co/y40pcRBi3OThe walk outs are not just about teacher pay, it's about civil rights issues. By underfunding our public schools, we're denying our students their right to a phenomenal education. https://t.co/Uryiftp8ESTeachers understand that an investment in public education is an investment in our future. Unfortunately, this sentiment is not shared by the AZ state govt. 

I'm sending teachers my support today &amp; calling for greater investment in public education.
 https://t.co/Tyhjr5IqkuI'm proud of Arizona teachers for standing up and saying, "Enough is enough." 

For too long our state legislature has cut taxes for corporations &amp; the wealthy, and our public schools paid the price. Thank you AZ teachers for fighting for our future! https://t.co/Tyhjr5IqkuIt was an honor to meet the extraordinary recipients of the @goldmanprize who truly demonstrate that one person can make a difference-even when the odds may be stacked against them. Thank you for your tireless work in protecting our environment. More info: https://t.co/GcV2HJRFEn https://t.co/fFMtBTPkewI look forward to the day when tribal sovereignty and government-to-government consultation is ingrained in our government practice so that we can truly support tribal communities by upholding our trust responsibilities. https://t.co/kCFrmCnG9oProud to join ITAA and discuss bold proposals about what we need for Indian Country. As tribal sovereignty is being redefined by this administration, Congress must hold federal agencies accountable for the programs that serve tribal communities. https://t.co/dO4bt2ol3VA $43,000 phone booth, first class flights while gallivanting around the globe, and a luxury condo for $50 a night, are just some of the unethical decisions that  #PollutingPruitt will have to answer for in today's hearing. #BootPruitt  https://t.co/TXjE5KcCKu#PollutingPruitt has never prioritized the health of the average American. From his days suing the agency he now runs, Pruitt has always put the interests of industry lobbyists ahead of public health. Just another reason why it's time to #BootPruitt. https://t.co/cddQLKdjWOAccording to Mick Mulvaney, if you're a lobbyist, you get a bigger say in government. After receiving $63,000 for his congressional campaigns, maybe this explains why he's rolling back consumer protections in his role at the CFPB. #CultureOfCorruption https://t.co/vvnk3gOQrEWhat happened in Flint four years ago was a tragedy and a wake-up call to us all. This is what happens when we stop investing in water infrastructure and fail to prioritize public health. #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/1HxqRXRklKTrump's #CultureOfCorruption continues. In another win for his lobbyist pals, #PollutingPruitt is limiting what scientific data can be used when crafting regulations that protect the public health of millions of Americans. https://t.co/afPqEafOVIOn the 4th anniversary of the #FlintWaterCrisis, I'm proud to join over 37 members of Congress to support the #WATERAct which would provide $35 billion a year to improve drinking water &amp; wastewater services in communities across the country.  https://t.co/F2AJTovNzWTrump‚Äôs #DACA decision was never about the rule of law and was erratic, impulsive, and based on pure nativism. I stand with #Dreamers and will continue fighting for a permanent legislative solution that protects them. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/JYRe0PSX0HDue to popular demand, the submission deadline for this year's Congressional Art Competition has been extended to Monday, April 30th. Please visit https://t.co/B3ewKVglEo for instructions on how to submit your art piece. https://t.co/f2yBhg9veQTrump‚Äôs proposed changes to the "public charge" rule may put up to 500,000 U.S. citizen children at risk of moving into poverty. This policy rooted in nativism and it should not be implemented. https://t.co/C1yzz60DwrProud to join my colleagues and oppose efforts to fundamentally change the Impact Aid Program and strip funding from approximately 1,200 school districts and 10 million students. #StandWithStudents https://t.co/Tb49ZyPpSSSNAP has demonstrable success in improving the health and wellbeing of children, adults, and seniors &amp; has lifted millions of Americans out of poverty. The GOP's attacks only stigmatize SNAP recipients &amp; will increase food insecurity in our community. https://t.co/bGBEwEP2nRI will continue pushing back against further militarization of border communities that result in senseless tragedies such as this one. No one should be above the law, and that includes the Border Patrol.Justice was not served today, and my condolences go out to the family of Jose Antonio. We must pass legislation that increases oversight and transparency of Border Patrol in order to better serve our communities. https://t.co/TZW7EseDK5As @realDonaldTrump goes on another Twitter tirade over asylum seekers, here's a quick primer he should read.  

In short, The United States has legal obligations to provide protection and certain rights to those who qualify as refugees &amp; asylum seekers. https://t.co/oHpHmCMkJcThe attacks on our transgender brothers and sisters by the Trump administration must end. This latest attempt to allow health care providers to openly discriminate will have life-threatening consequences for the transgender community. https://t.co/GqtTNaNSZ8The federal government's trust responsibility to tribes includes healthcare for Native Americans. It's downright shameful that the Trump administration continues to reverse centuries-old policies developed by tribes and our forefathers. https://t.co/VrebVsyDS4Teachers are fed up with the status quo. Overcrowded schools, outdated textbooks, and embarrassingly low teacher salaries are no way to invest in the future of Arizona. https://t.co/IvupNMjJ46In light of #EarthDay yesterday, it's important to remember how far we've come and remain committed to tackling the most pressing environmental issues of the future like #ClimateChange, habitat destruction, and environmental justice. https://t.co/C7o2TvYcxXOn #EarthDay, let‚Äôs recommit our efforts to combatting climate change, enacting policies that benefit our environment, and fighting for environmental justice for all our communities. https://t.co/xGXa25SKocSessions' attempt to terminate programs that provide legal assistance to migrants in our immigration courts was cruel and heartless. I joined over 102 of my colleagues to express my opposition and stand up for due process rights for everyone. https://t.co/A1dWfgNsOFRemember the #DeepwaterDisaster oil spill 8 years ago that claimed 11 lives and took 6 months to cap? Now, Trump is paving the way for a repeat. We need to invest in renewable energy to guarantee a catastrophe of that magnitude never happens again #ActOnClimate #ProtectOurCoast https://t.co/B5CXCYaLBg#Climatechange increases heat waves, severe storms, air pollution &amp; the spread of disease, yet many of Trump's cronies in his cabinet don't even believe it exists. This #EarthDay, let's recommit our efforts to act on climate an protect out planet for future generations. https://t.co/PfFUduU6tITrump's proposed changes to the immigration court system is an insult to due process and the rule of law. Quotas will only result in rushed hearings and hasty decisions that will undermine the credibility of the system and put migrants at risk. https://t.co/er2TCAtraXThis ill-advised ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù proposal is intended to discourage hardworking people from seeking legal status and deter immigrant families, including those with U.S. citizen children, from seeking care and services when they need it. https://t.co/2v6YF1jDQEWhile @realdonaldtrump and his cronies look to sell our environmental protections to the highest bidder, I‚Äôm proud of my 100% rating from @LCVoters, and will continue to fight for legislation that protects our communities.  https://t.co/LnYFqftpqg #CommunitiesFirstReportWhat is it about Trump cabinet officials and their penchant for living the high life on the taxpayer's dime? Next member of Trump's #CultureOfCorruption: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his private planes. https://t.co/BhIO1KnbwLTrump's border wall isn't just a financial disaster &amp; a useless deterrent for immigrants, it's an environmental hazard. As the Trump administration bypasses environmental laws to build the wall, its long-term environmental impact may be irreversible. https://t.co/wLdfuTTfnMNeed a primer on the unethical behavior of #PollutingPruitt? Between the scandals, cozy relationships with industry lobbyists, &amp; rollbacks of important public health protections, Pruitt needs to go. Proud to join 130 House Reps to call for his resignation. https://t.co/5IOSiyfVO3It confirms what we knew all along: Trump's travel ban had nothing to do with vetting procedures or security.

Racism and anti-Muslim sentiment have no place in policy-making. https://t.co/na0X0j92E0This is downright shameful and a slap in the face to each of our U.S. citizen brothers and sisters who live in Puerto Rico. We can, and we must, do more to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria.  https://t.co/8Z4qZk4kwQScott Pruitt's ethical shortcomings are too numerous to fit in a single tweet, but they're nothing new to the #CultureOfCorruption of Trump and his cronies. It's time to #BootPruitt &amp; get industry insiders our of the agency that protects our public health. https://t.co/DhlEWcVUxPBarbara Bush led a full life of grace and leaves behind a great legacy. I offer my deepest condolences to the Bush Family this evening for their loss. https://t.co/0FvonVy2VTWhy does the EPA administrator need a $43,000 soundproof phone booth? Just another dubious act from ethically-averse Scott Pruitt. 

Far from 'draining the swamp' Trump has only created a #CultureofCorruption 

https://t.co/X3L3gdAk8NTax cuts don‚Äôt pay for themselves, so how does the GOP want to pay for the #GOPTaxScam? With harmful cuts to #SNAP and other safety net programs, which help families access affordable, nutritious food, and alleviate poverty.

On behalf of #AZ03, I wish you the best of luck. https://t.co/2ITrJaT4cYDespite promises from the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, the average worker is not benefiting from the #GOPTaxScam. They did nothing more than rig the system for the wealthiest, including themselves. #TrumpTax https://t.co/C5mB0H9BSm #TaxDayLooks like the American people are recognizing that the #GOPTaxScam was nothing more than a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% and wealthy corporations. Recent polls show that only 27 % of Americans call them a good idea. #TaxDay https://t.co/dfxNemyf19Congratulations to Diego Favela for his appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy! #AZ03 is proud of your accomplishment and wishes you the best of luck in your future endeavors. https://t.co/RGzIEENC7oPolitically-motivated assignments in the Dept of Interior disproportionately target Native Americans and seem to be part of a disturbing pattern by leaders seeking to silence Native viewpoints.  https://t.co/O1OCCbaYKdHow can we improve our country if we don't value our educators &amp; our public schools? To our teachers &amp; students: you deserve better than low salaries, outdated textbooks &amp; crumbling buildings.

One casualty of his rollback? The health of the American people. https://t.co/i9dCspQz1IThat‚Äôs why I joined my colleagues in a bipartisan call for the Trump administration to consult with Congress before deepening our involvement in the Syrian quagmire. Trump‚Äôs rash postering is not in the interests of our nation, world peace, or our military. https://t.co/scVIJoLH8EAssad‚Äôs chemical attack was horrific, yet more war without genuine diplomacy is shortsighted and further inflames Syria‚Äôs conflict. The president failed to consult Congress, and it‚Äôs clear this strike will do little to solve Syria‚Äôs humanitarian crisis.  https://t.co/7lQooVoCDEYou can't make this stuff up. Trump and Pruitt are rolling back more public health protections. Shameful behavior from two individuals who would rather protect the profits of corporations over the air quality and public health of millions of Americans. https://t.co/6ROybLyZp2Surprise, surprise. Looks like the wealth isn't trickling down. While Trump and his corporate pals reap in profits, the #GOPTaxScam has left America's working families behind. https://t.co/I61MqnG0GAConsumers deserve to be protected, yet Mick Mulvaney is stacking the odds against them and rigging the system for big banks and corporations by weakening important consumer protections at the CFPB.  https://t.co/1LMHJwk8zjAnother day, another ridiculous Scott Pruitt request. This time, instead of promoting the mission of the EPA, he allegedly wanted to promote...himself. All this while making it easier for big corporations to pollute our air, water, and land. https://t.co/3DQmOR1bPN #BootPruittInstead of improving infrastructure in our national parks for more people to enjoy, Trump would rather scapegoat important conservation priorities and shortchange park operations in favor of expanded oil and gas drilling on public lands. https://t.co/BraOnkGIGXTrump's nefarious immigration plans don't solely target undocumented immigrants--but legal ones as well. By determining if immigrants will be a 'public charge', more legal immigrants shun impt health and nutrition programs for fears of repercussions. https://t.co/kdzNoAHHeYAt a time when white supremacist movements are marching in our streets and using Nazi symbols and ideologies as rallying points, it's now more important that ever that #WeRemember all of the Holocaust victims and survivors and honor their memory. https://t.co/wnBSDVlwC0The Trump and Sessions Justice Dept. is a disaster for immigrants as evidenced by this latest report. This administration is shamefully attempting to leave immigrants absolutely helpless while navigating the complexities of our immigration courts.   https://t.co/UYT10lhpbGTrump's National Guard deployment has hit a significant bump in the road. Looks like the cavalry ain't coming to Indian Country. https://t.co/uLuVgtOg2WWithout demographic data on the LGBT community, we jeopardize our ability to ensure that federal programs &amp; legislation adequately account for their specific needs.

Just another sad reality of the corrupt Trump administration. #BootPruitt  https://t.co/yOC71nIgyGDeploying troops to the border is a massive waste of money and nothing more than an attempt to use Arizona as a political pawn in Trump's anti-immigrant agenda.  https://t.co/ExfWzJGqFtAt the Protecting Immigrant Families briefing today, I reiterated my commitment to standing up and fighting back against the Trump administration‚Äôs policies that target immigrant families. #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/1kyEW2nB3LLet's keep up the momentum long after #EqualPayDay has passed. That's why I support the #PaycheckFairnessAct, which would help close the #wagegap by giving workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination. https://t.co/adixqeBTCILatinas must work until November 1, 2018 for their salaries to catch up to what white men made in 2017! This is unacceptable. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/22lFckKvZfIt's absurd that on average, women are paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. For women of color, it's even worse. #EqualPayDay #talkpay https://t.co/XBhvGhE9tOThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has identified two scams targeting veterans.

Investing in public edu. ensures that our teachers receive great pay, benefits, and resources to empower the next generation of students.   https://t.co/Hg43rRw1j0What constitutes a 'great job' according to Trump? 

Looks like flying first class and safeguarding the interests of oil and gas lobbyists while dismantling important health protections for American families constitutes a favorable job performance.   https://t.co/FcGO1mvnDLMy message to Gov. Ducey: Arizona must not be used as a political pawn for the Trump administration's anti-immigrant agenda. 

Here's the letter I sent expressing my concern over national guards troops deployed to our southern border. https://t.co/TiJWUVQqh0 https://t.co/dfzHb5BcgvKoch-funded groups remain hell-bent on making a quick buck off of our veterans by privatizing the VA. 

We should be doing more--not less--to ensure that our vets receive the care they deserve. https://t.co/9Rnhy8COXJThe Trump administration continues its war on science by scrubbing any mention of human activity contributing to #ClimateChange from a report on rising sea levels.  https://t.co/8p3Fvvz9i1The truth about the "caravan" of immigrants that Trump is attacking: It isn't a group of immigrants "invading" the United States. It's a group of asylum seekers fleeing unimaginable violence in their home countries.  https://t.co/poLFH2mUasLike most people in the Trump administration, Scott Pruitt only cares about himself &amp; his corporate pals.

Putting the interests of corporations over the clean air, clean water, &amp; health of the American people is no way to run the EPA--it's just shameful. https://t.co/h8TAukMLSETrump knows that his tax plan is garbage. He literally tossed his prepared remarks in the air so that he could repeat already debunked falsehoods on immigrants, crime, and voting conspiracy theories.  https://t.co/7qGvaeicr3#PollutingPruitt‚Äôs motto while running the EPA: Treat yourself. 

While treating himself to the high life on the taxpayer‚Äôs dime, Scott Pruitt is simultaneous destroying important regulations that safeguard the public of all Americans. https://t.co/tZvSebxvQaTrump rose to power through fear-mongering, scapegoating immigrants, and ignoring facts; so why should his presidency be any different?  https://t.co/Rt099w9zmuNeed help keeping track of Trump's litany of lies on immigration, voter fraud, and China during last night's even in West Virginia? Here's helpful fact check. https://t.co/EEdRlhtIbKCronyism and corruption are the hallmarks of the Trump administration, and none of that is more apparent than in the case of Scott Pruitt. While he rolls back regulations that protect America's families, taxpayers fund his first-class life of luxury. https://t.co/dUfs9BSibMWithout input from the American people and their elected representatives, the Trump administration could make NAFTA even worse for workers. Here are 14 recommendations from the Congressional Progressive Caucus. https://t.co/jhd6OtoPfRWith @realdonaldtrump seeking to quickly complete a deal, @USProgressives have released proposed changes to #NAFTA that are essential to improving the lives of working people. https://t.co/jhd6Ot7eoj #ReplaceNAFTABorder crossings are at historic lows &amp; more troops will do little to deter drug smuggling. 

More funding for tech and infrastructure to modernize our ports of entry is the best way to secure our border w/out further militarizing our communities. https://t.co/nlxNgHPlXE50 years have passed since the tragic assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Today we honor the indomitable legacy he left behind, which has inspired millions to fight for social justice and a better America that is more inclusive and equal for everyone. #MLK50 https://t.co/6T6m293VBXWall Street doesn't need more protections thanks to their cozy relationship w/ Trump's cronies. As leader of the CFPB, Mick Mulvaney is trying to weaken the CFPB's ability to protect consumers and is putting the interests of Wall Street over Main Street. https://t.co/jHxJClQ7S1Unethical pay raises, first-class travel, cozy relationships with industry lobbyists are just a day in the life of Scott Pruitt. 

All this while he dismantles the important protections that safeguard our clean air, water, and land. Time to #BootPruitt. https://t.co/lgIy97uSrnAfter Trump‚Äôs failure to secure funding for his ‚Äúbig beautiful wall,‚Äù he‚Äôs clearly grasping for straws. Sending military troops to occupy the border is the latest in his reign of terror that wreaks havoc on immigrants &amp; residents of border communities. https://t.co/y7ZBtH9mvUI sent a letter to the Dept of Justice urging them to block Sinclair‚Äôs dramatic expansion plans.

We should be doing more--not less--to stop climate change from negatively impacting our communities.   https://t.co/1LJF6h4tYhWhen Scott Pruitt isn't dismantling public health protections, he's flying first class on the taxpayer dime. We need a champion in the EPA who actively wants to protect our environment--not sell it to the highest bidder. It's time to #BootPruitt. https://t.co/dasRvGEtKAFor the record, it has always been Trump who killed #DACA and has opposed any bipartisan compromises. Here's a convenient list of all of the times our "deal-maker-in-chief" has obstructed efforts to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/1sXOk1YbFQ#ICYMI: My office held a citizenship fair in Tucson this weekend to help legal permanent residents take that final step to become citizens. Thanks to all of the volunteers who came out to help! #AZ03 https://t.co/KR58Oa0PXbImmigrants who enter the US today would not even qualify for #DACA. Trump is telling blatant lies to support his anti-immigrant narrative and justifying his heartless decision to end the program in the first place. #ProtectDreamers  https://t.co/oULC7QL81ETrump has no interest in actually helping #DACA recipients or fixing our immigration system. Since he made the decision to end the program, he gambled with the lives of 800,000+ #Dreamers for a divisive wall and has obstructed every attempt at compromise. https://t.co/9dsKrJEd2iThank you to all of our amazing volunteers at today's citizenship fair! #AZ03 https://t.co/yi8xtMnHJVThe reception was attended by outstanding community leaders who served as mentors to all of the student participants. Thanks to all the mentors and students who helped us celebrate  #WomensHistoryMonth. https://t.co/24SULzDhCfWe closed out #WomensHistoryMonth with a special event where we announced the winners of our ‚ÄúWomen Who Inspire Me‚Äù essay competition.  This year‚Äôs winners wrote about their mom, their grandmother, and their teacher. https://t.co/He3x7pHRo8For @realDonaldTrump  to further lower the bar and subject more pregnant women to shackling, solitary confinement, and denial of adequate food and care is disgusting. https://t.co/cgQpk7LD0JHowever, other vets have already been deported--even after putting their lives at risk for our nation. The Veterans Visa and Protection Act that I introduced will allow eligible deported vets to return to the US as Lawful Permanent Residents eligible for naturalization. https://t.co/wCqXdfstInDeported army vet Hector Barajas-Varela just received news that he will become a citizen after he was deported to Tijuana 10 years ago. He's a longtime advocate for deported vets in Tijuana, and I was proud to pen a letter of support for his pardon.  https://t.co/bAma32KKK8It doesn't take a stable genius to determine why Trump ended #DACA. Racial slurs and xenophobic remarks have no place in policy-making. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/4aXbBxfpHK#ClimateChange is making high-tide flooding worse along the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico and will have long term impacts on coastal infrastructure and the people who live there. More must be done--not less--to proactively combat these negative effects. https://t.co/EJFRdXJayuDespite Trump's fear-mongering and gross characterizations of immigrants, we still are--and will always be--a nation of immigrants. https://t.co/QlOZmoen2QIn honor of the lifetime work of #CesarChavez, #DoloresHuerta, and the farmworker and #labor movement, it's time to ensure farmworkers receive the fair wages they deserve.

(2/3) https://t.co/JrjinXydDEWe've seen discrimination in the military before with 'Don't ask, don't tell'. Trump's transgender military ban attacks our troops, prevents qualified people from serving, and is a pathetic attempt to peddle a backwards political agenda.  https://t.co/ULqcE8j6I7Our nation's farmworkers are some of the most indispensable, hardworking people in the country. (1/3) https://t.co/3HymoshQ7ZIncluding a citizenship question in the #2020Census will suppress participation &amp; will result in inaccurate data that will leave communities underrepresented and underfunded. https://t.co/d47qP35wLZ https://t.co/7gIVSuxKP8Allowing certain individuals &amp; companies to profit off of our veterans' health issues  is a new low--even for Trump and his cronies. Instead of privatizing vet's healthcare, we must implement reforms that improve service for millions who rely upon the VA. https://t.co/KE09BXPtxtHonoring Cesar Chavez‚Äôs legacy today in San Luis, AZ by announcing new legislation that will finally allow farmworkers to qualify for overtime pay and remedy decades of discrimination against the hardworking Americans who pick the food that feeds us all. https://t.co/7h8JQ2Vn4zBut I thought Mexico was paying for it? #NoBorderWall https://t.co/tOa55y81hxPeddling conspiracies of "secret science" and climate change denial should disqualify anyone from serving at EPA Administrator. If #PollutingPruitt can't accept the facts, he should not be in charge of safeguarding our public health. #BootPruitt https://t.co/7YnTGnnPWZWhy is an accurate population count so important? Federal funding distribution, important demographic research, political representation, and more is contingent on an accurate census. https://t.co/dGiXijHTtfWhile the families of Flint, Michigan still await clean water, #PollutingPruitt installs a secret phone booth &amp; flies first class around the world.

We can do better, and we must pass gun safety legislation now. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/KhSD7misU7Perhaps our poor, bone spur-suffering president should recognize that any qualified American willing to put their life on the line in service to our country should be allowed to do so, and not face bigotry in the process. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/RVgexxmGu4When I march in Tucson tomorrow, I‚Äôm marching for the students and teachers who want gun safety legislation instead of more militarization of their schools.
