Thanks to @lawyer_moms for meeting with me in Springfield today to discuss keeping all families together. https://t.co/uA9NEW0kJFCongratulations to Jacob Amaro of the Roger L. Putnam Vocational Technical Academy in @Springfieldk12 for winning the #MA01 Congressional Art Competition. Yesterday his artwork was unveiled in the U.S. Capitol where it will be displayed for the next year. https://t.co/Kbd7tfvaImThe House just failed to pass GOP "compromise" immigration legislation. It must be real bipartisan legislation that is crafted and enacted to solve this humanitarian crisis. #FamiliesBelongTogther 
https://t.co/chyn8Q0EUqIt was great to meet Nova and her family from Springfield today in DC when they were in town advocating for @BostonChildrens and the great work they do. She is a great promoter. #gobig #bchindc #speaknowforkids https://t.co/RYHN7YTdXnJoined my colleagues today to denounce Republicans’ renewed efforts to dismantle ACA’s pre-existing conditions protections which would affect almost 3 million people in MA including those w/ asthma, diabetes, cancer, mental health or substance abuse issues &amp; even pregnant women. https://t.co/o25Qz6Vz72ICYMI: Here's my op-ed from the @BerkshireEagle on the issue from April.
https://t.co/wSwRXYyxgNThe #SCOTUS ruling against unions in Janus v AFSCME is yet another unprecedented attack on free speech. It is because of unions that we have a 5-day/40-hour work week, affordable health care &amp; great public schools. I will continue to fight for these rights &amp; these great workers.Our Founding Fathers had the foresight to include in the Constitution individuals’ right to due process of law to protect against government abuse and overreach. Denying even one person due process endangers all of our rights and erodes our nation’s founding principles. https://t.co/6PFeDwe7S8Small businesses rely on #NetNeutrality to connect with customers nationwide online. These businesses use the Internet as an equal playing field to compete with larger corporations. https://t.co/ZC89AAMPi5History will look back on today's #SCOTUS decision as one where the court endorsed discrimination. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/2sVdnbbr2INo one should be denied care because they have a pre-existing condition. Republicans are trying to strike down protections to make that a reality. This is Joanne, a 3-time cancer survivor from Holyoke who wrote to me about the importance of quality care for all. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/AduyPjwT0eJoining my colleagues on the steps of the Capitol to support #FamiliesBelongTogether and call on the Trump Administration to end this heartless policy. https://t.co/z12bJtTB6II'm happy to work with @RepJerryNadler and be a co-sponsor of this bill to #KeepFamiliesTogether. The Trump Administration's policy is cruel and inhumane. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Pc2CiliDGyHow many more families will be traumatized before this cruel &amp; inhumane program is halted? President Trump could stop these forcible separations with one phone call but he continues to play politics with the lives of people seeking asylum in the US https://t.co/gpkrpBYTy1Happy #FathersDay to all those across #CD1 and the country. Enjoy your day. https://t.co/C98dqeHVnX#ICYMI: All rides this weekend on the new @HartfordLine are free. Find train times here: https://t.co/iDnrDjDqsa https://t.co/hn8Ps3A5ZZGreat to be in #Hartford today with @GovMalloyOffice @SenChrisDodd @SenBlumenthal @RepJohnLarson @MassDOT &amp; #ConnDOT officials to celebrate the opening of the @HartfordLine - a tremendous multi-state initiative. More info here: https://t.co/hrPmqM91ch https://t.co/qqnMSAxpS0I spoke on the floor today regarding HR 5788, the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act of 2018. This bill is designed to prevent dangerous and illegal contraband such as synthetic opioids, from entering the US through the international mail. https://t.co/Om909q0NRRMA is home to one of the largest concentrations of #PuertoRicans in the US. And they still need our help following #HurricaneMaria. Along with my MA colleagues, we sent a letter to @fema urging for the initiation of the Disaster Housing Assistance Program. https://t.co/Nyj9jn1dbVIn Massachusetts alone 2,903,000 individuals have pre-existing conditions. Now, the Trump Administration is undermining the health care of millions by trying to rip away their protections under the #ACA. We must continue to #ProtectOurCare! https://t.co/23PyvpEjJYLIVE at noon: https://t.co/3sUugF5qUr. I join Democratic leadership to demand answers from the Trump Administration regarding their intention to strip protections from 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. We must #ProtectOurCareThanks @MassGovernor @MassDOT Mayor Sarno &amp; state legislators who joined me today at #UnionStation to announce a #Greenfield pilot program &amp; a RFP for east/west rail.  These infrastructure investments help our entire region strive. https://t.co/iHR4o5mpNQThis is another troubling move from the current administration. Targeting victims of domestic violence is simply disgraceful. https://t.co/RLZJxKJ7bkThe @FCC took away a free and open Internet. The Senate has voted to #SaveTheInternet. I’m supporting the same legislation here in the House that will bring #NetNeutrality back. https://t.co/TTTRwgzZehToday’s bill is HR 3.  HR 1 was the #GOPtaxbill and a giveaway to billionaires.  HR 2 cut food assistance for working families.  And now HR 3 is cutting $7 billion from the Children’s Health Insurance Program.  I guess this reflects the top three Republican priorities. https://t.co/RY3mgk3Jd3Happy to welcome students from #Chicopee's Dupont Middle School to the Capitol today. https://t.co/u00didmHz9This afternoon I met with families currently living in #CD1 who were displaced by Hurricane Maria hitting #PuertoRico. I vowed to continue my work to #rebuildPR and fight for #education and #healthcare for those here and still on the island. https://t.co/H3qDInViyTThanks to @EPAnewengland Alex Dunn for meeting with members of the New England Delegation today to discuss projects happening in the region. https://t.co/04BRtRSwHHHappy to celebrate the achievements of the @SpfldPartners Community Scholarship winners this morning and offer the keynote address. Best wishes to all for continued success &amp; thanks to this great organization for all they do. https://t.co/W3glFgKC1IThanks to @MASSCreative and @masscultural for their continued partnership. https://t.co/BHLFB20rRZGreat day celebrating @NEAarts grants to @shakeandco @TanglewoodMA @TheMahaiwe @JacobsPillow @BarringtonStage @CMSS4 #NorthAdams Public School District &amp; City of #Pittsfield totaling close to $350,000. The arts are alive and thriving #intheberkshires &amp; CD1. https://t.co/3Lt0FPqxgQThe Harvard report out today regarding the death toll in #PuertoRico is staggering. My statement is below. https://t.co/MhLpAmTDbSCongratulations to Edward Thomas of @PopeFrancisHS on his appointment to the @NavalAcademy. A great accomplishment and day of pride for you and your family. https://t.co/SVX0vKLDo2From there, it was on to #Lee for their Memorial Day parade. Great to be with @repsmitty &amp; @adamghinds #intheberkshires for these events. https://t.co/7tta9YRzFtThis morning in #Richmond, I was honored to participate in a #MemorialDay ceremony to thank Corporal David A. Reynolds, Berkshire County's sole surviving veteran of WWII's Iwo Jima battle. It was a poignant reminder of the true meaning of this day. https://t.co/jbYasdF9w3Today, I voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 because it benefits so many entities in western and central Massachusetts. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/5woiAsy471Always happy to welcome @mayitaalcaldesa and her staff to the office to discuss how we can work together to #rebuildPR. https://t.co/II9kAf0EbnLet's invest in something people will take: opportunities. https://t.co/6p3TgG7nXmThanks to @MassGovernor for meeting with the Massachusetts delegation today in DC to discuss the state of the Commonwealth and how we can continue to work together for our constituents. https://t.co/fREtr2jwF4Congratulations to #Longmeadow's own @BrynnCartelli on winning #TheVoice last night. You have quite a future ahead of you. https://t.co/8OGAqTm3dDAmericans want to work, and they’re eager to learn new skills that will allow them to find good jobs and support their families. This bill is a win for employers who are looking for qualified workers, and a win for parents and their kids’ futures. https://t.co/Gh1avj718xCongrats to @townofwilbraham #Minnechaug student Sebastian Karpinski on his nomination to @WestPoint_USMA. Wishing you continued success. https://t.co/ay0Pajh4SqIn honor of #ArmedForcesDay I extend my sincere gratitude to all those in all branches of the armed forces who have selflessly protected our freedoms in the past and continue to do so today. https://t.co/1trhBz6HMeWestern &amp; central MA is full of craft breweries. As co-chair of the Small Brewers Caucus I am proud to see these small businesses thriving. They are a true example of entrepreneurship, hard work and dedication. Find a local brewery here: https://t.co/Id1Kvuf8y8 https://t.co/S8JGxiwRNwThis #GOPFarmBill hurts the American people – farmers, students, children, veterans, the elderly, and disabled. It's failure today is a victory. We need to work together to make the investments needed to strengthen farmers, consumers &amp; communities. https://t.co/f7OdSoC28wToday’s shooting in Texas is just another reminder of the urgency for common sense gun control. Schools should be a safe place for learning. Parents shouldn't have to worry that saying goodbye to their children in the morning could be the last time they see them. #EndGunViolenceThe #OpioidEpidemic is not a Democrat or Republican issue. Everyone in this room has a family member or knows someone close to them directly connected to the opioid crisis. One markup is not going to solve this public health epidemic but this is a good first step. https://t.co/FIuMGYvFUzNew developments in the fight for a free and open internet – the Senate votes today led by my friend @SenMarkey.  I support the same #NetNeutrality legislation in the House that will #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/boGqdOg9TnLast year, Republicans wrote a law that gives 83% of the tax savings to the top 1%. Now, 86 million American families will see their tax bills increase. That's not tax reform. https://t.co/oRwpp94IwxMy staff met with @ALSAMA today for #ALSAwarenessMonth on #ALSHillDay18. Happy to join the fight to find a cure. https://t.co/k21MEX2KvTThis week we recognize #NationalPoliceWeek and the brave local, state, and federal officers who have died or been disabled in the line of duty. We are forever grateful for their sacrifices. https://t.co/HzXoaqiiSLJoin me in voting for @LongmeadowMA superstar @BrynnCartelli on @NBCTheVoice tonight #VoiceTop8 #BrittonBrynnDuet https://t.co/SmQPXHmJmlCongratulations to @SpringfieldK12 student Jacob Amaro from Putnam who was chosen as the winner of the 2018 Congressional Art Competition from #CD1 for his self-portrait entitled “Iishraq.” It’ll be on display for the next year in the @uscapitol. https://t.co/WZS4TYcPSkThis #MothersDay let us give working mothers what they really need - paid family and medical leave, and fair pay. Time to bring the #FAMILYact and the #PaycheckFairnessAct to the floor for a vote. https://t.co/DQ8ZFVwZk1Yesterday Kay Simpson of @SpfldMuseums and I took Dr. Seuss' stepdaughter Leagrey Dimond on a tour of Springfield #UnionStation. It was during a train ride from here to NYC that Dr. Seuss got the idea for his book "The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins." https://t.co/yAvHmI8u0kToday’s #prescriptiondrug proposal from President Trump stops short of providing meaningful solutions that will solve this problem and will not prevent the types of abuses caused by bad actors. https://t.co/DYnVziwB25Thanks to @PresTorrecilha at @WestfieldState for the great tour of campus today. Quite an impressive atmosphere and a great reminder of the importance of our local colleges and universities. https://t.co/VrEPDvcqGFSenate Democrats move one step closer to forcing vote to #SaveTheInternet. Proud to support similar #NetNeutrality legislation here in the House.  The fight for a free and open internet continues thanks in part to my good friend @SenMarkey.The withdrawal from the #IranNuclearDeal will damage our credibility &amp; isolate the United States from the intl community. The US should be strengthening the agreement to make sure Iran does not pursue its nuclear ambitions, rather than walking away from a diplomatic accord. https://t.co/6cI3BWYxVJThis is simply unacceptable. Democrats are looking for ways to make health care more affordable and accessible, not more expensive and less available. https://t.co/Cj4siYxBGfToday we thank teachers - in #MA1 and across the country - who go above and beyond in their quest to cultivate learning, inspire future generations, and ensure success both in and out of the classroom. #TeacherAppreciatonDay https://t.co/c5TW7e3eXgOne year after #Trumpcare vote, @FrankPallone @BobbyScott &amp; I urged @SpeakerRyan to allow a vote on legislation that helps stabilize health care markets, makes coverage more affordable, &amp; reverses harmful policies that undermine the US health care system. https://t.co/NnZwUcQ1kcIn Massachusetts alone, #Trumpcare would have meant 328,100 people losing coverage including 234,600 people with Medicaid and 5,500 veterans. In addition, close to 34,000 workers would have lost their jobs. Democrats continue to #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/r1Un0Hbj3qStudents from #Easthampton High School were in DC earlier this week representing Massachusetts in the We the People competition. Congratulations on a job well done. https://t.co/kxKzVlV5L7 https://t.co/ekttgICbOaFrom there, I visited @SercoGroup in #Ludlow for a tour of their facility and to visit with staff before heading to @YWCAWesternMA to see the YouthBuild Community program in motion thanks to a $1.1 million @USDOL grant. https://t.co/GCmLJcvmRJToday at the @HCBA_LRIS's annual #LawDay celebration I spoke on the 2018 theme of "Separation of Powers" and was happy to congratulate two worthy recipients of the John M. Greaney Award, Judge William Boyle &amp; Ken O'Connor. https://t.co/ARmCpHAiQJSmall businesses not only provide good paying jobs to our neighbors and friends. They also invigorate our local communities and economies. During #SmallBusinessWeek, we will continue to push for better tax policy to ensure all small businesses can succeed.Last week @SenMarkey &amp; I met w @FCC to continue to discuss the lack of local news &amp; programming in some areas of WMass. Residents have been cut off from news pertinent to where they live. It is unacceptable. Along w @SenWarren, we are committed to fighting for a speedy change. https://t.co/BClfmhZRKzI joined my colleagues today to pass the FAA Reauthorization Act which authorizes the FAA for 5 years &amp; includes an important change to the Stafford Act to allow for predisaster planning and better rebuilding efforts. 
https://t.co/bLXxJNYvXMEighteen-thousand precision manufacturing jobs in New England go unanswered every single day. One million tech jobs across the country go unanswered every single day. The skills gap must be addressed. https://t.co/VfemUslsjrThis morning I met with Kenneth McClintock, former Sec of State and LG of #PuertoRico &amp; Mayita Melendez, Mayor of #Ponce to discuss the needs of the still recovering island. We must continue to signal the importance of restoration. A long-term plan is imperative. https://t.co/vCrx03BQYAThanks to @AARPMA for their advocacy on these incredibly important issues that I have spent my career fighting for. https://t.co/rdXrl7jofFI am proud to work with my colleagues @BillPascrell and @PatTiberi to address this issue by introducing the STOP Act. https://t.co/76IjzjW1MFToday I met with @federalreserve Chairman Powell about the state of our economy, the reasons behind the decline in our labor force participation rates and potential solutions. https://t.co/X6sBwPhBNgDuring #NationalParkWeek I am reminded just how lucky we are to have 15 great parks right here in #Massachusetts.

She was intelligent and gracious, and the love she had for her family and the American people was clear to see. I offer my condolences to the entire Bush family during this difficult time. https://t.co/V3NEftKVW8I am pleased @stevenmnuchin1 listened to my concerns and granted this extension quickly for online filers. . https://t.co/WtMQ0zDLXhThe #IRS is experiencing technical difficulties today w/ direct tax return payments. #TaxDay is stressful enough already, even when things go right. I implore the IRS to allow an extension so that every taxpayer attempting to file today has a fair shot to do so without penalty.Tax cuts don't pay for themselves. 

So how do Republicans want to pay for the #GOPTaxScam? By cutting crucial benefits like #Medicare, #Medicaid, and #SocialSecurity. https://t.co/XBzja36iSlBecause of the #GOPTaxScam, the middle class in Massachusetts gets left behind. Meanwhile, the top 5% of earners in our state receive 64% of tax breaks. https://t.co/A2uXy5WYCxInstead of adding $2.3 trillion to our debt to provide the wealthy and big corporations with tax cuts, and then vilifying American workers who are trying to get ahead, we should fight to raise wages and invest in the skills that lead to opportunity. https://t.co/adnYPeuRR5Once again, I call on President Trump to articulate a coherent strategy for his actions in #Syria and seek Congressional approval for any further military action in the region.Good luck to all those running the #BostonMarathon today.I can't say it enough: tax cuts don't pay for themselves. The GOP's Balanced Budget Amendment is just another reminder of that.  

https://t.co/ScCUB6Za2x https://t.co/MamHLQmZq1During #HolocaustRemembranceDay, let us honor the innocent victims of the Holocaust, teach future generations about the dangers of genocide and anti-semitism, and pledge to never forget what happened in Europe 80 years ago. https://t.co/QNw4bbueOx https://t.co/MRs556uCk5The new tariffs will bring disruption to the U.S. economy.  The tariffs will raise costs for some, disrupt supply chains, and they are also provoking threats of retaliation and real retaliation from countries like China. https://t.co/kLiTucakRc#EqualPayDay symbolizes when, more than three months into the year, women’s wages catch up to what men were paid in the previous year. The #PaycheckFairnessAct would help close the #wagegap by giving workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination. https://t.co/drKMApkJZMLast week I visited @SpauldingRehab's new facility with its President David Storto. This hospital provides tremendous care to its patients from across MA and the entire country. I met the Tapp family from the Springfield area who are benefiting from its great doctors and staff. https://t.co/j9bIJN4N4tI am proud to have been the lead democratic sponsor of the #housing credit legislation that was enacted in the #omnibus. It has provided critical financing for the development of over 48,000 affordable homes in #Massachusetts - including almost 10,000 in #CD1 alone.With @JayAshEOHED @MayorLachapelle @CHAPAdotorg and other #affordablehousing leaders from across the state to discuss the importance of the #LIHTC and see firsthand how it was used at @BeingBeacon's Treehouse at Easthampton Meadows development. https://t.co/ccRaxCrjFmLabor unions are more critical to America’s success than ever. Americans know that freedom is not given, it is fought for – and it must be protected. And we’re going to keep fighting to protect it. #JANUSvsAFSCME https://t.co/VR721keUiNOn #MLK50 I am reminded of King's visit to #Springfield and how his life and legacy shaped my own political aspirations. 
https://t.co/5ra0CZJtdzOn a recent visit to #Westfield I stopped into Pilgrim Candle. It is small family-run businesses like these that I will continue to fight for to ensure that the #GOPtaxbill doesn't sabotage their success.

Proud to support a law that provides millions with health care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/QQoAdK4zuKToday marks the 8th anniversary of the #ACA being signed into law. While I am proud to have been one of its early supporters, I am even more proud to have helped write this landmark legislation that has insured over 20mil people. Now it is time to continue to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/CayMNj3pSLWhile this #omnibusbill is far from ideal, I am happy it includes many items that will benefit residents of the First Congressional District - including #ruralbroadband, #opioid epidemic funding &amp; #infrastructure improvements.

As the product of a working family, I am well aware of the challenges placed before families. Choosing whether to care for a loved one or pay the bills should not be one of them. https://t.co/bTkguQYEBl#ICYMI I was granted a perfect score on @LCVoters National Environmental Scorecard for my dedication to environmental protections. Full report here: https://t.co/ph8EuGPz7Q #LCVScorecard https://t.co/GtV8lb95hITeachers need more funding for educational materials, curriculum support, &amp; school supplies. The focus needs to stay on passing common sense gun legislation that will strengthen &amp; improve our federal background check system.I am strongly opposed to arming teachers in our classrooms. A recent @QuinnipiacPoll found that while 75 percent of individuals believe that Congress must do more to reduce #gunviolence, only 20 percent think giving educators guns is the answer.Without #NetNeutrality big corporations could have an unfair advantage over small businesses online. They deserve a level playing field. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/NjkKvv6dNRThere needs to be an acknowledgment that this #GOPTaxBill was done in haste and that there were many mistakes. https://t.co/iEyxLJs48jThis is welcome news. My colleagues and I on the Friends of Ireland Caucus sent a letter to President Trump just yesterday urging this very important move.  https://t.co/F78gnSVlAUThis legislation addresses this gap in coverage, expanding access to critical and lifesaving treatment options for Medicare beneficiaries at a time when #opioid abuse is growing among the senior population. https://t.co/E80FUsQepjWhat an amazing #Gold win for @TeamUSA @usahockey and @westfield_ma's own @kbells22. Congratulations to #TeamUSA in #PyeongChang2018 https://t.co/UqQM9OD701As we continue to celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth &amp; the 50th Anniversary of the passing of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. let us remember the work and words of Dr. King and his dream of a more perfect union. https://t.co/nUGBh7V7tyHard-working Americans who planned their whole lives for a financially secure #retirement should not have those assurances taken away through no fault of their own https://t.co/IA0Xkcl6dYRural broadband is a huge issue for constituents in western and central #Massachusetts. While I am thankful for @MassGovernor's support and partnership, we need more aid from the federal government so that all of our cities and towns are connected and thriving. https://t.co/9sN29rWdEgAs a father &amp; grandfather, parents shouldn't have to worry about the safety of their children when they drop them off at school. The time for Congress to pass common sense gun legislation that will strengthen and improve our federal background check system is long overdue. https://t.co/afgTaernMWInstead of cutting programs that middle-class families rely on, I call on my Republican colleagues to work with us on a bipartisan basis to fix problems impacting working families. https://t.co/LL3wHe6CJqToday the Ways and Means Committee is meeting with @USTreasury @stevenmnuchin1 regarding the 2019 budget. Live here: https://t.co/GGGW4onQbZ https://t.co/lM8kpWHJZMMy colleague @repjohnlewis is right. Instead of focusing on giving big corporations and the wealthy more than $2 trillion in tax breaks, we should be breaking down obstacles so middle-class families can get ahead. https://t.co/FjH4y52bNLThe Ways and Means Committee is meeting this morning with @HHSGov Secretary Alex Azar to discuss the #2019budget. Watch LIVE here: https://t.co/gHHiXNeYmXIn August, I brought you along as I toured the First Congressional District. Now, here's a chance to see what goes on in just a few days in Washington. https://t.co/fyVKIFfyqvThis country needs a big #infrastructure plan – to repair our communities and to put our people back to work. President Trump’s proposal released today on how to go about that change falls tremendously short. 
https://t.co/TBCxysQvwfChief of Staff of the @jctgov Tom Barthold joined me and close to 100 tax professionals in #Springfield today for an explanation of the nuances of the tax code following the passage of the #GOPTaxBill. https://t.co/OXydGVtrPwTerrific to see #Pittsfield born, #Lanesborough raised Chris @mazdzer win the silver medal in men's single luge for #TeamUSA.

https://t.co/IqcRYTAdiBThis is terrific news for our community and state. @massmutual has made its home in #Springfield for nearly 170 years. The company has been a solid corporate citizen that continues to invest its considerable resources locally. https://t.co/4jv9htwGY2This is big news for those in western and central Massachusetts dealing with #crumblingfoundations in their homes. Thanks to @RepJoeCourtney &amp; @RepJohnLarson for their partnership. https://t.co/d66AEiy3SyWe all know someone who is touched by the #opioidepidemic. While we continue to work in Congress for ways to combat it, I've written to health insurers to see what their approach is and how we can move forward toward a solution together. https://t.co/0Bm3uGdtHuThis morning I spoke to @TheCIAB's Legislative Summit about commercial insurance and what the #GOPTaxBill means for their members. https://t.co/lKyIU80chyThanks to this great group from @AICUM who met with me today to discuss higher education policy.

https://t.co/kburBOxAegAt the #SOTU President Trump talked about putting our country first. We simply cannot have an “America First” agenda that does not lift up ALL Americans from ALL walks of life. https://t.co/UpbYYAN5lcI am thrilled to have Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi as my guest to the #SOTU. Sheriff Cocchi has been out front on the #opioidepidemic and I have been happy to have him as a partner as we look for ways in which to curb this problem that plagues so many we know and love. https://t.co/uafW0BKsbHThanks to @ShannonYoung413 of @masslivenews for visiting me in DC for a preview of the #SOTU tonight.

Thank you for your support of this important bill - HR 4444. https://t.co/RgYUa7ZL0iHard-working Americans who planned their whole lives for a financially secure retirement should not have those assurances taken away through no fault of their own. https://t.co/1Q3y83LT7lI joined @TeamstersLU122 today to highlight the importance of HR 4444 - the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act. This bill aims at financially supporting troubled multiemployer pension plans so they don’t fail. https://t.co/660kdQiGNaThere are 18k manufacturing jobs that go unanswered in New England. I was happy to visit @schottusa in #Southbridge today with @S_T_C_C to discuss ways in which we can try to bridge that gap. https://t.co/SDU9PLjhorWe're in the 16th hour of the #TrumpShutdown leaving Americans concerned about our economy, federal workers, CHIP, aid for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and so many other things impacted by the lack of a resolution. https://t.co/RPSA3FmHMKI’m ready &amp; willing to do the work to open the government – but Republicans are doing nothing to put an end to the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/D5x8Ci6sKKFacts about the #TrumpShutdown:
-It didn’t have to happen
-Republicans had months to avert it
-Americans deserve betterThe business community and the world need certainty that we will be open for business but the #GOPshutdown prohibits that. https://t.co/5EhbjwtpOtWith the #TrumpShutdown underway, I want to ensure my constituents know my offices remain open and staffed to provide critical resources to residents across the First Congressional District. https://t.co/yFmDLsQGGYThe American people deserve certainty in their government &amp; shutting down is not the answer. Offering funding solutions on a month to month basis is not a way to govern. Republicans need to stop hiding from important issues we were sent here to work on.Yesterday the New England Delegation met with Eric Rosengren, President of @BostonFed to discuss the 2018 outlook on the economy, and what it will specifically mean for these six states. https://t.co/07IftGHInUThank you to @RepDelBene for her work on this important issue. Everyone has a family member or knows someone directly impacted by the #opioidepidemic. https://t.co/7MFAuZcAznCongress &amp; the Admin simply are not doing enough to help Americans access necessary treatment for opioid use disorders. We must stop undermining the programs that provide coverage and treatment for those who need it.

Listen here: https://t.co/Ifz6PmMDXaI met with members from @1199mass today to discuss the ongoing relief efforts in #PuertoRico and the #VirginIslands. This meeting was incredibly important as #CD1 has one of the largest Puerto Rican populations off the island. https://t.co/uZ6UOsmFrMSenator @RonWyden and I are working to prevent the Trump Administration from manipulating hardworking Americans’ tax bills to exploit the middle class for political gain. https://t.co/ZpZJjswugM@baxandobrien @tweetRock102 ICYMI - Listen to the entire interview here: https://t.co/e6utZ9sks7Historic day in #Springfield as the @USArmy transfers the @SPARNHS museum to the @NatlParkService ensuring the important story of the city and the Armory is preserved for generations to come. https://t.co/lXCkEcIHyDAbout to be live on the air with @baxandobrien on @tweetRock102.

Great small business here in #CD1. https://t.co/YKdLCHKcKoKeeping our environment clean and safe should not be a partisan issue.

It was very clear from Day One - we were anxious to tackle #taxreform. https://t.co/QMJiJli9g5Last week, I sent a letter to the IRS asking for clarification on pre-payments of property taxes as it relates to the new limitations on the state and local tax deduction under federal law. Some uncertainty remains as we move into 2018 https://t.co/P05NTcadN8https://t.co/B2icT891HKBy the 10th year of this #GOPTaxScam, 83% of the benefit accrues to the people at the very top of our economic system. That's not middle-class tax relief. This is not tax reform. This is a missed opportunity. https://t.co/wWDvj0Z2CZFACT: 86 MILLION American middle class families would see a tax hike under the #GOPTaxScam. Back to the floor to fight against it. Live here: https://t.co/qZWTX6XsHvThe entire revenue system has been flipped on its head without one public hearing, without any witness testimony, without the solicitation of one expert. And the Republican majority has decided to go forward with this reckless #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/DC1nyHkP0KThis is a missed opportunity. The American family deserves better than the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/LbUFqWrOM5This #GOPTaxBill is the most regressive piece of tax legislation that has come from the Ways and Means Committee in the 25 years that I have been a member. https://t.co/WSXP0N3F2U https://t.co/DgPEsjQm1EWatch live as my colleagues and I continue to fight this #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/0R6RTBkmdDI'll be live with @NancyPelosi discussing the #GOPTaxScam and what it will do to hard-working American families. Spoiler alert: it won't help. Tune in here at 11:30AM https://t.co/oQfWtDjNxLThe more we look into this #GOPTaxBill the more we see it for what it really is - a #GOPTaxScam. Look what it would do to Massachusetts families. This is a tax cut for the wealthy. Not tax reform. Period. https://t.co/eQMlQLrrSTStarting at 9am, I’ll be live with @SRuhle on @MSNBC talking about the #GOPTaxBill https://t.co/rX4v4NGatrI am deeply disappointed by the FCC’s decision to repeal #netneutrality. This move undermines and reverses consumer protective regulations already in place that allow for a level playing field in the e-commerce marketplace. https://t.co/czs55RrNrJThe #GOPTaxScam vote should wait until Doug Jones is seated, or is @SenateMajLdr McConnell scared that the more time Americans have to learn about the bill, the more opposition he will face? https://t.co/dbFQ80TZX5Starting at 2pm, I join my colleagues on the Conference Committee to discuss HR 1, the #GOPTaxBill. Watch live here ➡️  https://t.co/QPxTdhiog8The #GOPTaxBill is a bad deal for the 36 million middle class families who will see their taxes go up; it’s a bad deal for the 13 million Americans who will no longer have healthcare coverage; and it will be an even worse deal for our children and grandchildren. https://t.co/xgse2HHeXuSenator McConnell must now respect the will of the voters in Alabama and stop consideration of the #GOPTaxBill until Senator-elect Jones is seated. https://t.co/ftUMw6dnHYOpen enrollment ends FRIDAY. 8 in 10 people can find plans for less than $75 a month.

RT if you oppose this scam on the middle class. https://t.co/n5kEPvDc5DAs the House and Senate move toward a possible conference on these exceptionally harmful bills, we have one last chance to do the right thing. We still have time to fulfill the promises we have all made to our constituents and stand up for the middle class and future generations. https://t.co/TRNfT5CuNLAt best, the #GOPTaxPlan will do nothing for working families. At worst, it will hike taxes, increase healthcare costs, and cut important services for families who are working hard and playing by the rules. https://t.co/8jIDpDJLOAA few things we don't know about the Senate #GOPTaxBill:

-What's the dynamic score from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation?
-How will the SALT provision be paid for?
-How this bill will affect President Trump’s taxes?What’s on the chopping block if the #GOPTaxScam passes? Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, &amp; other programs for millions of Americans. https://t.co/cGIgkc7H2JMy sincere condolences to the families of these young men, including #Navy Lt.

Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families.Congratulations to the new #Springfield Postmaster Joe Conti as he is sworn in today. https://t.co/ZVUvxzHSrDThis is a missed opportunity. Constructing this tax bill could have been a great bipartisan accomplishment but instead it is a #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/cwZgPihJSpNewspapers across the country have a message for Republicans: the GOP bill is a #GOPTaxScam that raises taxes on middle class families. https://t.co/WZ7S5E8WHSLast night I continued to argue against the #GOPTaxScam that is a bad deal for millions of Americans, particularly those in the Middle Class. This bill is simply not what the American people asked us to do and it is not something that I can support. https://t.co/24MDat15NyFACT CHECK: Who gets tax cuts under #GOPTaxScam? The wealthiest Americans &amp; corps. Who gets tax increase? 36 million middle class families. https://t.co/RJOVpkPg6CLast night I voted in favor of the #NDAA to ensure large employers in #CD1 like Westover, Barnes, Warren Pumps &amp; General Dynamics have the adequate support from the fed govt to continue to do their work supporting our country on the national &amp; intl level. https://t.co/78o31x1DsVWho wins with the #GOPTaxScam? 
-Wealthy Americans
-Corporations

Who pays the bill?
-Middle-class families
-Seniors
-Students 
-Veterans https://t.co/UI27hUd5ndIn #NorthAdams this afternoon for the dedication of the Armory site in memory of SPC. Michael R. DeMascio II, a #Drury High School grad.

A great program, thank you for your service. https://t.co/nAel8M0gvdThe #GOPTaxBill that advanced today will hurt Americans at every stage of their lives. We will continue to fight this middle-class tax hike and are committed to a fairer path forward. https://t.co/p7HpEwEj1BThis #GOPTaxBill discussion has been inartful &amp; indefensible. After 4 days, not one Democratic amendment has passed. This #GOPTaxScam contributes to complexity after having been advertised as the avenue to simplicity. https://t.co/OJFsK9ZFfJ https://t.co/k014OC5t2JHistoric Tax Credits help to tell the story of our country.
