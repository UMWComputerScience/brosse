Tweet us your ?s https://t.co/R9Sym4Tq5dNow that we know what's in the #GOPTaxPlan, what cuts/eliminations concern you the most about the bill?Overall, the #GOPTaxPlan is heartless.  Raising taxes for middle-class families, taking away vital tax deductions, and cutting funding to Medicare &amp; Medicaid just doesn't sound like a plan that benefits hard-working Americans.@FAFSA With college tuition increasing every year, the federal government must do more to help students that are drowning in student debt.The 2nd major tax deduction the #GOPTaxPlan will cut is the student loan deduction. In 2016, @FAFSA reported that 544,000 individuals in Louisiana have student loans.It's a shame that the #GOPTaxPlan eliminates the medical expense deduction. This allows deductions for preventive care treatments, surgeries, dental and vision expenses, and long-term care for chronically ill citizens. https://t.co/qeABKoxTqTThe #GOPTaxPlan will put an unfair burden on working families to give tax breaks to the wealthy. Low and middle-income families will lose vital tax deductions that help they survive day-to-day. https://t.co/aXaztRmTRkDespite the GOP’s lack of outreach, the Affordable Care Act is still thriving.
