#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/WdTnicxWFXIf true, bad news for Ukrainian population in the US. The US should NOT recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Crimea is part of Ukraine. @ukrassociation https://t.co/kReqQD6vXJNow joining folks for the Mount Vernon #FamiliesBelongTogether rally. Congress must bring these families back together, to have a compassionate policy in the United States and fight against this inhumane policy the administration is putting forward. @familiesbelong#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/hjiGmVsCSUHeaded to the Bellingham #FamiliesBelongTogether rally. We need to make sure we are working hard to reunite these families. We need to replace deterrence with compassion. We need to replace callousness with humanity.

But safety must remain the number one priority. More than 2.5 million passengers fly through U.S. airspace each day.According to @WAStateCommerce, more than three dozen space-related companies are part of Washington’s space cluster, including such well-known companies as @blueorigin, @SpaceX, @SpaceflightInc @Boeing and others.The U.S. commercial space industry represents almost half of the $345 billion global space economy.

I am an original cosponsor of the Keeping Families Together Act to end the practice of family separation &amp; require DHS to develop policies and procedures allowing parents and children to reunite.Formal policies regarding reporting of sexual assault &amp; harassment in transportation are essential to ensuring the safety of employees &amp; passengers.

It is an opportunity to learn about the past and solve the challenges of the future. https://t.co/IBVIkERHRgClaim: “The Democrats have failed to come to the table, failed to help this president close these loopholes and fix this problem.” Fact: This administration has made the choice to implement a “zero tolerance” policy.Claim: “We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period." Fact: Data from the Department of Homeland Security paints a different picture.Claim: "If you don’t want your child separated, then don’t bring them across the border illegally." Fact: The U.S. government has an obligation to allow asylum seekers to come in at official ports of entry.Claim: The administration has said, people who want to claim asylum should seek it the “right way.” Fact: There is more than one way to come to the United States and claim asylum.From claims stating there is a “right way” to seek asylum to claims parents broke the law by seeking asylum, many of the statements the administration has made about family separation are simply false. Here are some of the facts about asylum  https://t.co/xvWEGCxyW1I have called on Homeland Security Approps to reject blanket policy of separating families @ border. Must restore funds for community-based alternatives, like Family Case Management Program. FCMP had 99% compliance w/immigration reqs like court hearings &amp; immigration appointmentsMany parents arrive at the border with their children to seek asylum. Separating children from their mothers and fathers is cruel and unacceptable.
