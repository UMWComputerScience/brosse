Their dedication is astounding. I remain proud to represent #CA17. https://t.co/CTZvaPOEOQThose who come this country should not be denied access to healthcare.

https://t.co/UacTS5NlrsI am heartened to learn that the California State Assembly recently  passed a resolution which echoes my concerns about Poland's Holocaust speech law. My full statement can be found here: https://t.co/fPVFgk5E35The global gag rule, a decades-old policy that blocks funding for international family planning and other women’s health services, is a policy that puts women at risk by denying them health care information.

https://t.co/A8DeCcsnFzIn Puerto Rico, school enrollment is falling and students’ academic proficiency is suffering. Congress needs to make a promise to teachers that we will focus on aiding and funding the public schools on the island and stand against privatizing education. https://t.co/cqpF36BFfpSome of the lowest teacher salaries are in states without strong labor laws. Lawmakers across the country should pay attention to why workers across the country are taking to the streets and pass laws to make employers pay them fair wages.
https://t.co/eXovgfW3DwIt would be catastrophic for the U.S. to help the UAE capture the port at Hodeidah. Doing so would worsen the situation for the nearly 29 million Yemenis currently facing famine. Congress must act to rein in this administration’s war powers.
https://t.co/tWpAVDJO4aAppalling that Trump has canceled the Philadelphia Eagles invite to the White House because some of the players weren’t going to attend. At the core of Trump’s reasoning — because they disagree with him.

https://t.co/tfwxRaRePj https://t.co/u3PMRR3ocSThe modern LGBT movement began with trans activists protesting police brutality towards the LGBT community at Stonewall. This #PrideMonth, we must remember the sacrifice of activists who made this movement possible, and recommit ourselves to the struggle for justice and equality. https://t.co/RGR5rco3hJFrm Katrina to Maria, it is clear that our government is not prepared for an increased frequency of natural disasters. If we wish to live in peace from nature, we must take a hard look at our climate and urban development policies and make sure that we are prepared for the futureNo one wants to live in a technological surveillance state. If people stand up and fight back against these abuses, we can make sure that technology serves the the needs of the people, rather than be used to surveill and control us.
https://t.co/LJFYojCVSyThe practice of punishing parents who are trying to save their children’s lives, and punishing children for being brought to safety by their parents by separating them is fundamentally cruel and un-American..@DHSgov denied that they were breaking the sacred bond between parents and children until the @NYT reported that more than 700 children have been separated from their moms &amp; dads since October. https://t.co/Y987nWNqoSToday is Gun Violence Awareness Day. Over 90 people are killed every day in America due to gun violence. This is a public health epidemic that must end, and Congress must pass common sense gun safety legislation to stop the bloodshed. #WearOrange. https://t.co/5dO2KTiX8vIf the GOP want to talk about ‘family values’ then they need to start talking about giving Americans a raise, especially millennials who graduated into the Great Recession. How can young people expect to start a family if they can’t even afford to to take care of themselves? https://t.co/karCJewhEWThe administration's decision to impose tariffs on our closest allies is bad economic policy masquerading as populism. Economically alienating ourselves from the EU doesn't make us stronger, it makes us more isolated and with fewer friends.
https://t.co/lOpg4Jo0YpThe retail apocalypse is coming due to automation and changes in how people shop. Congress cannot sit on its hands while millions of jobs are lost due to these changes.

@RepDarrenSoto.Janus v. AFSCME is not about the so-called ‘right to work’. It is an attempt by corporate America to destroy unions and crush the power of working people.

The United States is the only nation to ever use a nuclear weapon in war, and we should not be escalating a new arms race with other nations."The Constitution supposes what the history of all Governments demonstrates, that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war and most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the Legislature." - James MadisonI have cosponsored the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2018 so that we can move forward on marijuana research and its medicinal effects as more states move towards its legalization.

Comprehensive, common sense gun safety laws are what this country needs so that everyone can feel safe at school and work.Only 10% of those battling drug addiction receive treatment.
