Our infrastructure helps drive our economic success but it’s also used by bad actors to traffic people, drugs and illegal guns. Last week, I hosted a #SolutionsOnly conversation on tackling this problem. #twill https://t.co/YScdFdpws2May is Mental Health Awareness Month. Check out my Congressional briefing on advancing the #mentalhealth of all Americans, especially African American women. #BlackGirlMagic #CBWG https://t.co/RN21FeenMRVisiting Washington DC this month? Enjoy Walk-Up Wednesdays at the @NMAAHC! No passes needed but you might want to get there early. https://t.co/T4DVdbqYzu#SolutionsOnly Idea 9: Keep this conversation going. We need to come together more so we can network, share ideas and find out what works best. https://t.co/qtMskb9jUd#SolutionsOnly Idea 8: Provide, mandate and fund regular training for law enforcement officers, health providers and others to identify survivors and connect them with needed services. https://t.co/3xBg3uEe2Z#SolutionsOnly Idea 7: Link service providers with law enforcement to cooperate and provide immediate services to survivors. https://t.co/oFzvn0sxVB#SolutionsOnly Idea 6: Increase mental and behavioral #health funding. https://t.co/e3N1t1GFqc#SolutionsOnly Idea 5: Ensure that training is gender responsive since both young women and young men are affected by trafficking but need different services and resources. https://t.co/p3xvmns3fz#SolutionsOnly Idea 4: We simply need more resources, at all levels, to tackle trafficking, support survivors and prevent people from falling into the life. https://t.co/j3v4FfD3bR#SolutionsOnly Idea 3: Provide law enforcement officers with tools to help survivors 24 hours a day. We can’t just give them a card and tell them to call Monday morning at 9am. https://t.co/0IgDUO8dUZ#SolutionsOnly Idea 2: Improve coordination between service providers, law enforcement and the community. We should consider developing a directory of organizations and services. https://t.co/sk6XRFgZWV#SolutionsOnly Idea 1: Increase awareness about sex trafficking. This is something EVERYONE can do in their community that will have an immediate impact. https://t.co/wleXioW6C7Today, I hosted my 2nd #SolutionsOnly hearing. This one was focused on addressing and stopping the illegal trafficking of persons, drugs and guns. I’m going to be sharing the solutions that we discussed. https://t.co/Dyy0eRX6hnJoin my #SolutionsOnly roundtable on trafficking - humans, drugs and illegal guns. https://t.co/YScdFdpws2#Kankakee is today’s #SmallBusinessWeek feature.

We need the General Assembly to find the ‘moral courage’ to override the veto of the lifesaving Gun Dealer Licensing Act. #SB1657The Second District is home to a booming #solar sector. We also have great programs that train residents for the amazing jobs being created by this green energy revolution! #GreenCollarJobs https://t.co/DhaRHcgd6FMy job readiness training session is Thursday from 5:30-7:00p at the Thornton Township High School's Technical Building.
