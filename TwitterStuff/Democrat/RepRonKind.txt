This week, try having a beer with a neighbor you don't usually agree with. It may not be the easy way, but it‚Äôs the Wisconsin way.Five years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but there is a solution. Today, I‚Äôm urging Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.The Farm Bill that passed today lavishes millions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies on big agribusinesses &amp; cuts vital conservation programs at the expense of family farmers. We need a Farm Bill that will work for our family farmers in WI ‚Äì not for powerful special interests in DCNo question that our immigration system is broken &amp; in need of repair, but separating families is wrong. It has never been the policy of our Nation to use children as political pawns. I am proud to support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to stop this practice &amp; reunite families.The keystone of our democracy is holding the power to choose our representatives - not the other way around. The U.S. Supreme Court's delayed decision on fair voting maps is disappointing, but not the end of the fight. https://t.co/CGPB5J8GMH"Instead of a go-it-alone approach, the United States should work with our allies to create a comprehensive strategy to bring China to the table to address these issues, and protect Wisconsin jobs."

Yesterday, I released my 2018 Farm Bill Priorities Report, which you can find on my website: https://t.co/uXgUc7eg2S https://t.co/QBRbG5neUhIf you have ideas about how Congress or the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus can help with the conservation effort, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to my office and make your voice heard. Conserving our environment today leads to a healthier #Wisconsin tomorrow. https://t.co/rCy1J860tuThese tariffs are a direct response to the President‚Äôs short-sighted trade decisions. It‚Äôs time that we stop treating our allies like our enemies, and set trade standards that support Wisconsin jobs. https://t.co/ScYjTFUKQ4There are no winners in trade wars ‚Äî only losers. The impacts on American manufacturers and the retribution exacted upon American farmers and ranchers will be substantial, costing us more jobs than will be saved. 
It's time for Congress to reclaim its powers over trade policies. https://t.co/Mc4IEJMPWyHappy Pride Month to all of the LGBTQ people &amp; allies in western and central Wisconsin.

This isn‚Äôt what our farmers need, and not how Washington should function.This #FarmBill is our chance to fix what‚Äôs not working for our farmers, not funnel more giveaways to millionaires &amp; huge agribusiness. The Farm Bill in its current form will force our farmers to work harder just to get by. Unacceptable.This week, the House Rules Committee voted to block my money-saving, bipartisan amendments to the Farm Bill. This is yet another example of Washington putting itself before hardworking Wisconsin farmers, workers, and families.I have traveled across Wisconsin to meet with our farmers, and hear the same thing over and over: Now, more than ever, we need a bill that levels the playing field.As a lifelong Wisconsinite, I know that one of the most important bills for growing our local economy &amp; supporting small &amp; family farms is the #FarmBill. I also know the crisis that our farmers face every day. Farms are closing, families are out of work, &amp; people feel betrayed.On #IDAHOT -  and every day -  I'm proud to stand up against hate and celebrate diversity. https://t.co/opojz84yFpWe need to come together and demand a better Farm Bill that works for Wisconsin farmers, families, and communities. #FarmBill https://t.co/K1mARsipkXWisconsin small businesses, schools and families depend on a free and open internet.

https://t.co/oaB2o9qXVhEmbarrassing that a nation as great as ours has resorted to funding our government for only weeks at a time.
