I’ll keep fighting in Congress to protect and defend this fundamental human value. https://t.co/RJ9D5TrcFqThanks to @Lawyer_Moms for presenting a letter to my #Commerce District Office calling to #KeepFamiliesTogether and #EndFamilyDetention! I'm helping to lead the fight in Congress against #FamilySeparation and #FamilyDetention. https://t.co/hoVCVEcSLuSo happy to hear that #EastLA’s Ofelia Esparza has won a @NEAarts National Heritage Fellowship.

It is a privilege to advocate for their rights in Congress &amp; to support their fight for respect &amp; equality. https://t.co/HOEzOLL8QSJune is #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, a time to celebrate immigrants' vital role in building America. We must keep America a beacon of hope and moral authority by opposing Trump's anti-immigrant policies, and by supporting sensible, humane, bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform. https://t.co/CHjH4E6sNOI look forward to working with new #LAPD Chief Michel Moore to keep #LosAngeles safe, ensure officers have the resources they need, and make certain that the rights of every resident are respected. @LAPDHQ @LAPDChiefMoore https://t.co/TSPV8BXgAcGreat to meet @BillGates tonight at the #LibraryOfCongress and to hear him talk about the importance of philanthropy, particularly in terms of investing in #health and #education! https://t.co/C8o6WuhQ6LGreeted #Paramount's Noah Endo, the 2018 Lucille Roybal-Allard Student Art Competition winner, at the @USCapitol!

Therefore, Justice Kennedy's replacement must be a #Kennedy-style swing vote. https://t.co/a5rq5dagGCA strong union movement strengthens ALL American workers. That's a fact. Unions help workers earn a decent wage, work in safe conditions &amp; retire with dignity. By a single vote, SCOTUS voted today to weaken #unions, &amp; that will weaken ALL American workers &amp; their families. #Janus https://t.co/pDrhgRJJt2Very pleased by this ruling to #EndFamilySeparation and reunite the #ImmigrantFamilies torn apart by the #TrumpAdministration. No more delays or excuses, Mr. President -- return every single child you ripped from their parents' arms, and return them NOW. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/MieETfS3W1Families are escaping horrors in their homeland and coming to America so that they can simply stay alive.  No amount of fearmongering by Jeff Sessions can distract from that central truth.The administration is not serious about fixing our broken immigration system if they continue to ignore the plight of the men, women, and children seeking asylum in our country.Jeff Sessions can throw around all the mischaracterizations and misinformation he wants, but he won't distract our focus from the fact that the administration’s policies are tearing innocent children from their parents.Once again, the attorney general is trying to deflect attention from the human crisis at the border that has been created by the Trump administration's policies.  https://t.co/aHy37eDqzWGreat news for #CA40! @FHLBankSF has awarded a $1.2 million #AffordableHousing Program (AHP) grant to bring 50 new units of permanent supportive housing to #SouthLA's Residences on Main!

That’s why Donald Trump created it. This anti-Muslim policy won’t keep America safer, and it disgraces our nation’s history as a haven for #ReligiousLiberty. #NoMuslimBanEverBy a single vote, the Supreme Court has awarded a victory to advocates of hatred, fear, and religious intolerance. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/jsljGlESxYWatch tonight's continued shadow hearing on the impact &amp; human cost of President Trump’s cruel #FamilySeparation policy. Join me, @HouseDemWomen, @RepJayapal, @HouseDemocrats, and experts for this important event! #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/6jIFiUMPMVBecause of the #SupremeCourt’s decision in #ShelbyCounty v. Holder, states with histories of #VoterDiscrimination are able to trick and scheme their way to getting the election results they prefer. We must ensure fair and equal #VotingRights in every state in our union!It's been five years since a #SupremeCourt majority struck a crippling blow against #VotingRights in their #ShelbyCounty v. Holder decision. Our future as a democracy hinges on guaranteeing the #RightToVote for every eligible American citizen. #RestoreTheVOTEIt's an extra special #OlympicDay this year for #CA40, now that #LA2028 is official! I was thrilled to help lead the congressional effort to land LA's third #OlympicGames, and can't wait to join in welcoming the world back to the #CityOfAngels in 10 short years. @LA2028 @OlympicsHappy 46th birthday to #TitleIX!  I'm so thankful that we have it to help us fight to stamp out #SexDiscrimination in our schools.  We can't stop until everyone in our #education system has an equal opportunity to learn and thrive in safety and security.Watch my House speech on the latest GOP #immigration bill. This legislation fails to meet our #Dreamers' needs, fails to address the crisis of children separated from their parents, authorizes prolonged detentions, and funds Trump's #BorderWall. This is a cruel and partisan bill. https://t.co/yw2NIdTU5bIt is impossible to understand how President Trump can ignore the pain he is causing the children separated from their parents.  And it is completely unacceptable that he now proposes to keep immigrant families together, but in detention with no certain end in sight.The president’s new executive order does nothing to reunite the immigrant children who have been torn away from their parents. Nor is there any effort on the president’s agenda to help address the damage that is already done to these children who have been separated.According to @AmerAcadPeds, the trauma children face when separated from their parents is unimaginable and often irreversible. Toxic stress can permanently change the architecture of a child's brain, and affect their health and their ability to succeed academically.I co-hosted a Capitol Hill forum today on Trump's cruel and unforgivable #FamilySeparation policy. Appreciated the remarkable insights from our expert panel and my fellow @HouseDemocrats, including @RepJayapal and @NancyPelosi. https://t.co/tyex168lNnWatch our 2:30PM ET shadow hearing on the impact &amp; human cost of President Trump’s cruel #FamilySeparation policy. Join me, @RepJayapal, @NancyPelosi, fellow @HouseDemocrats, and experts for this important event! #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/fqVs4x43RnWhile Trump says he’s ending his cruel separation of families, his new executive order regrettably replaces one immoral policy with others, including the indefinite detention of women and children. We must continue to fight against POTUS’s inhumane and un-American policies.Today is #WorldRefugeeDay. I remind Donald Trump that America, even before it was a country, has always been a beacon for those fleeing oppression &amp; violence. We cannot stop now. I urge him to end his cruel efforts to block asylum claims and separate families. #WRD2018Donald Trump is tearing babies from their parents.

How can anyone stay silent as this horror takes place?

Where is the humanity?

Whose idea of morality is this?

How can anyone rationalize this?

What is wrong with this man?

#KeepFamiliesTogether

https://t.co/XCjHAVl6XnWhen #DonaldTrump came to the #USCapitol tonight, I joined with @HispanicCaucus colleagues to confront him to his face, and to shame him for his inhumane #FamilySeparation policy. He CAN and MUST #EndFamilySeparation immediately! #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/oKb3I9nm6sI'm at the @USCapitol to challenge Trump on his cruel #FamilySeparation policy. #EndFamilySeparation, Mr. President, and #KeepFamiliesTogether! https://t.co/XrmvnBThs1Today, on #Juneteenth, we celebrate 153 years since the end of slavery in America. As we honor this great victory for freedom, let us also rededicate ourselves to the unfinished work of securing social and economic justice for all. https://t.co/iLivjA4yoRAs ranking Democrat on Homeland Security Appropriations, I've co-written a letter to top Republican appropriators demanding a hearing on Trump's cruel and inhumane #FamilySeparation policy. https://t.co/EXiNlUDPd2

#KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/vDRkpJImM2Immigrants aren't an infestation, Mr. President. They are human beings.

The children you've ripped from their parents are human beings.

Asylum seekers are human beings.

Your immigrant ancestors were human beings.

Start acting like a human being and stop demonizing immigrants. https://t.co/OVcwZohoUCIt's just chilling to listen to the wails of these frightened, desperate children torn from their parents. This is Donald Trump's family separation policy, for all to hear. He created this policy, and he could end it today -- but he wants these kids as a bargaining chip. https://t.co/t9whBPcxZ7We're at the San Diego border to investigate @realDonaldTrump's zero-humanity #FamilySeparation policy. No child should have to suffer the trauma of being ripped from their parents' arms. @POTUS should be ashamed of himself for showing such cruelty to little children. https://t.co/eRaTljIzAgOur congressional delegation to the San Diego border is holding a press conference to describe what we're seeing here as Donald Trump refuses to end his shameful and immoral #FamilySeparation policy. Watch at https://t.co/cKrm4v1who.

#KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogetherThe president wants to keep lying, but the truth is clear: #FamilySeparation is Donald Trump's shameful policy, and his policy alone.  He could end this cruelty with a single phone call.  Make the call, Mr. President! https://t.co/2VlmW8YZoUAs the Trump Administration doubles down on its cruel decision to rip #immigrant children away from their parents, I'm at the San Diego border with @NancyPelosi and @HispanicCaucus colleagues to see the consequences of Donald Trump's zero-humanity policy of #FamilySeparation. https://t.co/youzq0NBZ8This #FathersDay, my heart is heavy at the knowledge that loving fathers are being torn from their kids at our border. @POTUS needs to stop his #FamilySeparation policy NOW!
#KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogetherI miss my father all the time, but especially on #FathersDay. “Pop’s” love, wisdom, and warmth brightened my life every day he was with us.

It slashes or eliminates money for #ClimateChange, #SchoolSafety, #FamilyPlanning, &amp; @SpecialOlympics. I hope we can work across the aisle to make this bill better! https://t.co/7oGUwn6PNuPres. Obama’s wisdom and compassion in instituting #DACA is in stark contrast to the Trump Admin’s cruel and heartless cancellation of DACA. I urge Congress to pass my #DreamAct to help qualified #Dreamers stay in America &amp; continue their positive impact on this nation they love.Thanks to Pres. Obama's announcement of DACA 6 years ago today, America has been immeasurably strengthened by the contributions of nearly 800,000 young people who call the U.S. their only home. DACA has helped these youth live, learn &amp; work in America without fear of deportation.#EidMubarak! As the holy month of #Ramadan ends, I wish all Muslims a happy #EidAlFitr, full of celebration and gratitude. https://t.co/mQO8lEp7rgThe president is lying.  There is no law requiring him to tear families apart.  Ripping children from their parents is his decision and his alone. https://t.co/M7Kiz6v30B@TeachForAmerica @AmeriCorps Thanks, @TeachForAmerica!

America can do amazing things when it works together with our allies.  I was glad to sign a congressional letter of support for the bid, and can't wait to welcome the tournament in 8 years! https://t.co/cEfPvTEYazWhen will Republican leaders have the courage to defend these innocent immigrant children from the Trump Administration's cruel abuse?  I urge Republicans to join me and my fellow Democrats to protect these children.America has always been a leader and a beacon of hope and moral authority for the rest of the world. Yet immigrant children as young as two years old are tragically suffering at our country's hands.I've been heartsick over reports of young immigrant children crying out for the parents who are no longer by their side. These children do not understand the Trump Administration’s xenophobic immigration policies. They simply yearn for their parents’ love and protection.Today, I joined House colleagues for a press event condemning the Trump Admin for their despicable separation of immigrant children from their parents at our border. Tearing apart these families inflicts inhumane trauma on the children that is nothing short of child abuse. https://t.co/6YT7KnBMhHI denounce the Trump Administration’s heartless, senseless decision to reject asylum for victims of domestic and gang violence. We must not ignore their desperate pleas. Denying them refuge has nothing to do with America's security -- it's just cruel and inhumane. https://t.co/fN0NmYh2X2Americans want us to help #Dreamers keep contributing to our nation. Sadly, @HouseGOP leaders have sabotaged our bipartisan petition to #ProtectDreamers. @SpeakerRyan should be standing up for our hardworking Dreamers, not trying to keep his party's right wing happy. https://t.co/TInwxf5gOUI'm at a 10:30AM ET press conference to condemn the Trump Administration for heartlessly tearing apart immigrant families at our border.

We must #KeepFamiliesTogether! #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/Z7YTQxCKAmIt was YOU who made the decision to tear immigrant families apart, Mr. President. Not Democrats. You. Anyone with a shred of decency would reverse this cruel policy right now and #KeepFamiliesTogether. #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/6eFQO9lO6OMay is #AsianPacificAmericanHeritageMonth, and I am pleased to salute our #AAPI community for all they have done to strengthen our nation, our economy, and our culture. Let’s keep working together to secure #ABetterDeal for #AAPIs and all Americans. #APAHM #APAHM18 https://t.co/lpuPdMRMq3This #OlderAmericansMonth, I say to #seniors: I’m proud to fight in Congress for the benefits you have earned, and to advocate for your health &amp; economic security. If you live in CA-40 &amp; need help obtaining your federal benefits, call my Commerce office at (323) 721-8790. #OAM18 https://t.co/XDo7vfn2MSAt today's Joint Select Cmte on Budget &amp; Approps Process Reform hearing, I spoke with witnesses about the treatment of #SocialSecurity &amp; #HealthCare in our federal #budgeting process. #Budget reforms can help us fund govt responsibly while keeping our promises to all Americans. https://t.co/082OvGWLwYThanks to @MySMFM for honoring my work to protect the health of #mothers and #infants! Childbirth can carry big health risks for moms &amp; babies, especially in communities of color. As #MaternityCare Caucus Co-Chair, I'm fighting for evidence-based policies that lower those risks. https://t.co/hZNkiTGBj9So appreciated my time today with Dezi and Ricardo, two #LACounty #FosterYouth who joined me in DC for #FosterYouthShadowDay! Grateful to hear their perspectives as I work to ensure our #FosterCare and #ChildWelfare systems give our young people the care and support they need. https://t.co/VlwJZa3YJoHonored to be an original cosponsor of the #HealthEquity &amp; Accountability Act (HEAA) intro'd today, which furthers the work I led as the 2014 HEAA author. Each HEAA advances the fight for better, fairer #HealthOutcomes for all Americans, no matter who they are or where they live.If we have any decency, we must work to reduce the pain caused to #children by this administration’s draconian #immigration reforms.  Our #HELPSeparatedChildren Act is a critical part of that effort.As we fight to pass the #HELPSeparatedChildren Act, we must also keep fighting for a comprehensive #immigration reform package that treats #children and families humanely while keeping our border secure.We need the #HELPSeparatedChildren Act because #children have been abandoned at home or at school after their parents’ detention, often without information about their parents’ location and without adequate arrangements for their care. That is totally unacceptable.I'm reintroducing the #HELPSeparatedChildren Act with @SenTinaSmith so we can create new tools to help protect minor #children from trauma and permanent separation from their parents when their parents are arrested or detained by U.S. #immigration officials.As the Trump Admin accelerates its cruel efforts to tear apart #ImmigrantFamilies at the border, it's never been more critical for us to protect the safety of the #children in these families. That's why I'm reintroducing the #HELPSeparatedChildren Act: https://t.co/QCNKVbafDKI never thought I'd see an Education Secretary endorse punishing young people for seeking an education. Secretary #DeVos's comments contradict our laws, disgrace her position, and insult our nation's proud immigrant history. https://t.co/6SWDTGjngGHad a productive meeting with @SecretService Dir. Randolph Alles at my DC office. As top Democrat on #HomelandSecurity Appropriations, I look forward to continuing our work together to ensure the #SecretService performs its duties with the utmost effectiveness &amp; professionalism. https://t.co/syh5kuJF1i#HarveyMilk was the first openly gay man elected to government office in America. His triumph inspired generations of #LGBTQ Americans to fight for a brighter future, and his courage echoes in our nation's continued battle to secure #LGBTQrights.

How can any of my colleagues oppose our commonsense #GunSafety reforms? Our children are at stake! https://t.co/uLOy1szLigProud to sign the House’s bipartisan discharge petition to force votes on bills to #ProtectDreamers. I urge all my GOP colleagues to sign on. The vast majority of Americans support a path to citizenship or permanent status for #Dreamers, and this petition can get us to that goal! https://t.co/40duf1iJneAsylum seekers are escaping horrors in their homeland. We should not be penalizing them based on unauthorized entry. That's why I introduced an amdt to prohibit use of funds to prosecute #AsylumSeekers for entering the U.S. without authorization. Sadly, the GOP rejected my amdt. https://t.co/CCfELTg8zlEn este Día Internacional contra la Homofobia, la Transfobia y la Bifobia, reafirmemos que NO debe haber lugar para el odio, la violencia y la discriminación contra nuestros hermanos y hermanas #LGBTQ. #IDAHOTB #IDAHOT #OrgulloLGBTOn this International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia, let us reaffirm that there must be NO place for hatred, violence, and discrimination against our #LGBTQ brothers and sisters. #IDAHOTB #IDAHOT #LGBTQPride https://t.co/Pv1NvQvbJRLast month, I led Approps Cmte questioning of @NIH Dir. Collins about reports that @NIAAAnews research is being influenced by the alcohol industry. I commend him for investigating these reports and suspending this study. NIH must do all it can to be a trusted source of facts! https://t.co/X76iqk1kjPGlad to speak at a @CHCI panel on how Congress can implement broader #GunViolence prevention policies and invest in #CommunityHealth. Congrats to my office's #CHCI fellow Marcella Hernandez on organizing and moderating this informative panel. #CHCIGraduateMujeres #CHCIBriefings18 https://t.co/Ev0hatdn5eTrump is calling #immigrants "animals" and hoping people won't remember he hired undocumented immigrants to work for him. Truly, immigrants do the work that Trump won't do -- like making America a stronger, fairer land for all. https://t.co/mnDhMiF7nI#Immigrants are not "animals," Mr. President. They come to America because they love the ideals of our nation -- ideals like justice, liberty, equality, and opportunity. You disgrace those ideals, and you disgrace America's rich #immigrant history. https://t.co/r4wtxErt3hSpoke out against an Approps amdt that would weaken govt authority over certain e-cigarettes and cigars, some of which have major appeal to children. We have a moral responsibility to protect our youth from #tobacco. The Approps Cmte should not have passed this rushed amendment.If you or someone you know is suffering mentally or emotionally, don't delay: Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK or visit https://t.co/ZjLElg7Cb4.

We must work to ensure all Americans get the #MentalHealthCare they need. #MHM2018 #EndStigma https://t.co/2cTjvHTvmiWe know that #HorseSlaughter is cruel, dangerous, and unnecessary. That is why I introduced an amendment today to prevent commercial horse slaughter in America. Sadly, the GOP majority opposed my amendment. I will keep fighting for the humane treatment of our nation's #horses! https://t.co/sbhf7SBt4JA8: Immigrant women &amp; families need new laws that stand up for them. We must pass my Help Separated Families Act to ensure immigration status does not disqualify moms from reuniting with their kids. We also need to pass my #DreamAct and fight for comprehensive immigration reform! https://t.co/sTCSAbwkiUA3: It's appalling that the Trump Admin continues to increase the number of pregnant women in detention, where these women do not receive adequate medical care, legal counseling, or support. No mom should have to fear for the well-being of herself or her child. #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/IJcmAXzU7IA3: The Trump Administration’s policies are tearing immigrant women from their children and families. The admin's cruelty is inflicting devastating stress and trauma on these women. We must #KeepFamiliesTogether, not tear them apart! #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/IJcmAXzU7IA1: Immigration is a pivotal women's rights issue.

Let me be clear: this administration is creating a generation of immigrant children who will suffer deep and lasting trauma. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAs we celebrate #MothersDay, we cannot forget that the Trump Admin is tearing kids &amp; moms apart at the border. The bond between a child &amp; mother is precious, unique, and irreplaceable. It is unconscionably cruel for our govt to break that bond. We must #KeepFamiliesTogether!My mother and I had a precious bond. I'd have been traumatized if anyone separated us, as Trump is now doing to moms and kids at the border. This #MothersDay, tweet a photo with your mom and share how you’d feel to be separated from her when you were young. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/yMqIX5gtJFThis #MothersDay, we affirm the truth that NO child should face the unthinkable terror of being forcibly separated from their mother by the government. Immigrant mothers simply seek a better life for their kids. We must stop inhumane family separation NOW. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/e1pZ0iNiV3It was a pleasure to stop by the #BellGardens Veterans Park Senior Center to take part in their #MothersDay celebration, where I was honored to crown Ana Maria Sánchez of Bell Gardens as the Bell Gardens Club Latino’s 2018 Mother of the Year! https://t.co/FQrwCgRPagJohn Kelly's comments against immigrants are revolting and shameful. Has he forgotten he's descended from Irish and Italian immigrants, and the similar derogatory statements and hatred his ancestors faced? Discrimination, ignorance, and bigotry are NEVER acceptable. https://t.co/Xrvg5JowWEKelly Sadler's comments are utterly disgraceful. Senator McCain is an American hero.

We must #SaveTheInternet!Spoke today in favor of an amdt to prevent the MilCon-VA Approps bill from funding a #BorderWall. We can’t let unnecessary border wall construction divert money from critical veteran or security priorities—and despite what POTUS says, American taxpayers will end up paying for it. https://t.co/CJb2E8hNUREd and I join our fellow Californians in sending prayers and condolences to the family and loved ones of former Governor George Deukmejian on his passing. https://t.co/mjIs5UIC0EIt was a pleasure to meet with @IthacaCollege Pres. Shirley Collado, the first #DominicanAmerican to serve as president of a four-year U.S. college! Empowering #Latina leaders like Pres. Collado is critical to building an America that can compete and thrive in the 21st century. https://t.co/FmpwagUmPWThe president is wrong to walk away from the #IranDeal. It's very simple: His decision makes America less safe and less credible, and makes it easier for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. https://t.co/8cLYHiPLItHappy #TeacherAppreciationDay! I’m so thankful to America’s teachers for educating our children, serving as role models, providing emotional support, and creating culturally and linguistically relevant environments where students of all backgrounds can thrive. #ThankATeacherAdding a citizenship question to the #2020Census will suppress participation.

I was pleased to introduce LA County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Debra Duardo as one of the honorees at the Women of the Year Luncheon. https://t.co/E3YSoXSSkIWe must pass Rep. @NydiaVelazquez’s American Promise Act, so individuals who have lived in the U.S. under #TPS for at least three years who have met all the security requirements can stay in America and pursue a path to naturalization.We should be keeping families together, not ripping parents from their U.S.-born children.  We should be strengthening our communities and businesses, not weakening them by removing hardworking #TPS holders who love this country.The Department of Homeland Security is utterly wrong to terminate #TemporaryProtectedStatus for 57,000 #Hondurans, many of whom have made America their home for many years.  I condemn #DHS's cruel announcement in the strongest terms. https://t.co/X6IpIa4YyuWas glad to join LA City Councilman @JoseHuizar and other city leaders in officially unveiling the naming of Carol Schatz Square at Wilshire Blvd &amp; Hope St in #DowntownLA.

As the top Democrat on House #HomelandSecurity Appropriations, seeing the border firsthand gives me a stronger sense of the realities we face as we set #DHS funding priorities for the years to come. https://t.co/LrfF3aRnssOn this #MayDay, we salute the hard workers that make our economy run.

Over the years, AMCHP has distinguished itself as a strong leader and relentless champion for advancing the health of American mothers and babies.I especially commend @AANP_News President Dr. Joyce Knestrick &amp; @AACNursing Board Chair Dr. Ann Cary for their support of Title VIII Nursing Workforce funding, which is critical to ensuring we have qualified, culturally competent nurses in underserved communities.Was impressed and inspired by the many members of the public who spoke at our Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations hearing today! They advocated for a remarkable set of programs and priorities to improve the well-being of our fellow Americans.So happy to meet eighth-grader Salomé, who shadowed me and my staff this morning for #TakeOurDaughtersToCongressDay!

HEAA seeks to ensure better and fairer health outcomes for all, regardless of who you are or where you live. #NMHM18No one’s health or life expectancy should be determined by the color of their skin or the zip code where they are born. That’s why I’ve been a leader of the fight to pass the Health Equity and Accountability Act and eliminate health disparities in every corner of America. #NMHM18As we observe National Minority Health Month, let's resolve to address the terrible fact that our minority communities face higher rates of premature deaths and preventable illnesses. Every man, woman, and child should have the same right to good health and a long life. #NMHM18Glad to meet with representatives from @NORPACofficial. We agree on the importance of a strong relationship between America and Israel. https://t.co/kdFEhkvv6BDuring today's Labor-HHS hearing on workforce training, I emphasized the value and importance of skills-based education, and also asked witnesses how to remedy the continued underrepresentation of women in STEM. https://t.co/8ct1xgm6PHAs top Dem on #HomelandSecurity Appropriations, I met with #DHS @SecNielsen one-on-one today to discuss a range of @DHSGov issues, including several specific policies that are crucial to CA-40 families.

But the decision's on hold for 90 days, and doesn’t change our need for a permanent legislative solution to #ProtectDreamers NOW. #DreamActNow https://t.co/XsfSGXEA6AThe Trump Admin's proposed changes to the "public charge" rule would force parents to choose between pursuing citizenship and feeding their children.

Lee. #JANMgala #JANM https://t.co/4SgwGzU44NThe tragic mass shooting in Nashville is yet another painful reminder of our need to pass common-sense gun safety laws. @SpeakerRyan, let's vote to protect our communities and #EndGunViolence!  https://t.co/aakoJgxAiyAs we celebrate #EarthDay, let's recommit to making our planet a green and healthy place. Every family deserves to live in a neighborhood with clean air, clean water, and clean land. As your congresswoman, I'll keep fighting for policies to protect our environment and our health. https://t.co/yOvcD26YVl#ExcessiveDrinking is responsible for the deaths of more than 4,300 American kids each year. That's heartbreaking and totally unacceptable. And it's why my #STOPAct, which funds crucial resources for preventing #UnderageDrinking, is so important. #AlcoholAwarenessMonth https://t.co/PKpkoXJRcEAlways a pleasure to meet with my friends from the LA/OC Building &amp; Construction Trades Council! We spoke about our mutual efforts to create good-paying Southern California jobs. https://t.co/jElYHzHvVVGreat to visit today with #LACounty Supervisor @HildaSolis and @LACo_DPSS Acting Director Antonia Jiménez! I look forward to working with them to ensure our communities offer every family a fair chance at the American Dream. https://t.co/LWCizy8GzyAppreciated today’s visit from @USC’s delegation to DC!  We agree on the importance of continued funding for homeland security research, including for cybersecurity projects. https://t.co/trcRHg3pPyIt's a privilege to represent our economically, culturally, and linguistically diverse 40th District. In the event of a disease outbreak, we must make sure our government is prepared to help everyone in our communities. Today, I asked @HHSGov leaders about this critical priority. https://t.co/OCYR6rl8QyMy heartfelt prayers and condolences to the Bush family as they mourn the loss of their matriarch, former First Lady Barbara Bush. She touched and inspired so many in her very full life. May her family, and all who knew her, be comforted by their loving remembrances of her. https://t.co/aWV0IQ9cXPToday was the first public hearing of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform! I was honored to be appointed to this bipartisan committee, which is working to fix our government's broken funding process. https://t.co/gumiCg60y8Great to speak with @USCoastGuard Commandant @ADMZukunft today about the #CoastGuard's funding needs at today’s #DHS hearing. As Adm. Zukunft concludes his tenure as commandant, I thank him and his wife Fran for all they've done to support and strengthen our amazing Coast Guard. https://t.co/h5tNu8tjZ5Did you know America's first #Latina Cabinet Secretary was from #LACounty? As #Labor Secretary, @HildaSolis led our govt's fight for safe, fair, &amp; dignified working conditions for all Americans. Glad to be with her in DC today to celebrate the unveiling of her official portrait! https://t.co/p9MVkCM2NOAlso, I continue to urge the president to support Syrian refugees who seek entry into America. Our hearts break for those suffering under Assad's regime. Decency and humanity demand that we help as many as we can.I hope my congressional colleagues of both parties will join me in reminding the president that America has three branches of government, and that he must respect Congress's role in deciding military action.I believe that America must respond to the vile chemical attack in Syria, but that response must come through congressional approval. Instead, President Trump has once again struck Syria on his own. https://t.co/zJs9R2FE4lAs California recovers from devastating wildfires and prepares to face new ones, I'm fighting to ensure a strong federal response to this crisis. I pressed @FEMA Admin. Brock Long to budget sufficient funding for the Disaster Relief Fund and its Fire Management Assistance Grants. https://t.co/bQxoXUaQYFI'm thrilled to announce the entries in the 2018 Lucille Roybal-Allard Student Art Competition are going on public display in the lobby of 500 Citadel Drive at @Citadel_Outlets! Come see this amazing artwork from April 14 through May 10, Mondays through Saturdays, from 8AM-7PM. https://t.co/54RMFiH9ECApril 14 will mark 4 years -- 1460 days -- since #BokoHaram abducted 276 schoolgirls. We must never stop fighting to rescue the 112 #ChibokGirls still in captivity. Let's #BringBackOurGirls! #BBOG https://t.co/OmggXcOpkjToday, @HouseGOP tried to get some cover for their deficit-exploding tax scam by voting on a so-called balanced budget constitutional amendment. I opposed this dangerous amendment because it would have a dire impact on our nation’s economy and families. https://t.co/lw0XqX8QT2Glad to greet Patrick Lavin and Sherilyn Wright from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers! A strong labor movement has always been essential to building and preserving a strong, prosperous middle class. #IBEW https://t.co/5BYxMCmTBGGood to visit with @USCoastGuard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft on Capitol Hill during a Sea Service Award ceremony!  Appreciate all his hard work to maintain a robust #CoastGuard that helps protect America. https://t.co/DdFvYElVfMThank you to the @HumaneSociety for honoring me with your Humane Legislator of the Year award! I am grateful for this high recognition as we work together to promote the well-being of our animal friends. https://t.co/Tge2zkzfwJThank you, Judge Real, for this sound ruling in support of our police and against Trump's cruel immigration policies! https://t.co/0BjX6AHsSFAs we observe Holocaust Remembrance Day, we mourn and reflect on all those killed in the Holocaust, including six million Jewish men, women, and children. We must say #NeverAgain, and recommit to eradicating anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry. #YomHashoahGlad to meet with Southeast Community Foundation founder Julie Coyne at my DC office today! Her team’s academic enrichment tutoring does a great job of preparing students for life beyond graduation. https://t.co/hvQZ1GTF5KAs a proud @CalStateLA alumna, I always enjoy visiting with President Covino and the #CSULA delegation! Glad to hear all their latest news about the educational opportunities they’re providing to our leaders of tomorrow. https://t.co/AkZ0clkMT8When @CBP or @ICEgov separates a family, that separation can create traumatic and irreparable harm. I questioned @DHSgov Sec. Nielsen today about her department’s family separation policies, because our #DHS agencies must do everything they can to keep families together. https://t.co/3l6yv70OyNI've been horrified by reports of pregnant immigrant detainees who have suffered miscarriages and gotten inadequate medical care while in detention. Today, I got DHS Sec. Nielsen's commitment to reply this week to my letter seeking info about the detention of pregnant immigrants. https://t.co/5qYtbRSVzuAs top Democrat on the House #HomelandSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee, it's my mission to fight for just and humane policies that keep America safe. I outlined my views to @DHSgov Sec. Nielsen when she appeared before our subcommittee today. https://t.co/I6gRx9Wt5eAs a leader in preventing underage drinking, I've been very disappointed by news reports that @NIAAAnews research decisions are being influenced by the alcohol industry. Today, I questioned @NIH Dir. Collins about this disturbing news. https://t.co/DJ0P4F2GNUAs we work to support sexual assault survivors, I'll keep fighting to pass my SAFE Act to provide survivors with important economic protections like unemployment insurance, safe leave from work, and protections from firing, so these survivors can get help or escape abuse. #SAAPMEvery 98 seconds, someone in America is sexually assaulted. We cannot ignore this crisis – we need to confront it head-on. As we observe Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month this April, we must keep working to stamp out this plague and help survivors. #SAAPM https://t.co/YgqhFMcHkNThe #EqualPay and #MeToo fights are linked together! In workplaces where sexual harassment is not addressed, women may feel less empowered to negotiate salaries and raises. That depresses their long-term earnings and professional advancement. #EqualPayDayThis #EqualPayDay, let’s remember there are many ways America can close the #WageGap. I’m fighting in Congress for the #PaycheckFairnessAct, #PaidSickDays, #PaidLeave, affordable #ChildCare, #RaiseTheWage, and more!At the current rate, women won't win #EqualPay until 2059. For many women of color, equal pay is even farther away: Black women will wait until 2124, and Latinas will wait until 2233. This #EqualPayDay, let’s recommit to closing the #WageGap for ALL. https://t.co/mMapbJ5t1gThe average woman working full-time has to wait until April 10 to earn what a man earned by the end of the year before. But many women have to wait even longer. Latinas must work until November 1 to match the past year's average salary for a white man! #EqualPayDay https://t.co/P6zCJSQp6vIt is appalling that in 2018, women working full-time earn just 80 cents for each dollar earned by men -- and for many women of color, the gap is even wider. Women need equal pay for equal work, and they need it NOW. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/6xAzHY5T2p¿Se está preguntando qué significan las últimas decisiónes judiciales sobre #DACA para usted y su familia? Lea esta folleto para la información: https://t.co/0f4DiaMRZM https://t.co/GBhIWxtlYrWondering what the latest judicial decisions on #DACA mean for you and your family? Read this flyer for info: https://t.co/qfhGaWkjNN https://t.co/8oJAnQAsWAMy prayers are with the people of Muenster and all of Germany as they mourn the victims of and recover from this tragedy. https://t.co/Jxpi1gyOqeAs the congresswoman for California's 40th District, the voices of my constituents guide my decisions each and every day. Mr. President, you are doing everything you can to ignore and invalidate their voices. You insult my constituents, and you insult our democracy.Mr. President, this is AMERICA. Here, we respect dissent! We fight for fair elections, and we honor their results. We believe in counting every vote, not just the votes you happen to like.President Trump keeps making up stories about California voter fraud. It is disgraceful that he persists in this vile and anti-democratic lie. https://t.co/shy4e9rBHNIf the president wants to deploy the National Guard, he owes us all some straightforward answers about how this deployment will be funded, how many troops will be deployed, what their precise mission will be, and how long it will last.Unauthorized border crossings are still extremely low by historical terms, and many border crossers are legally turning themselves in to the Border Patrol in order to claim asylum.I am deeply skeptical about the White House's timing, rationale, and lack of detail in announcing its intent to send National Guard forces to our southern border. https://t.co/0gXqGJdcNQEstoy colaborando con el miembro del consejo de Maywood, Eddie De La Riva, para traer la Cruz Roja y su proyecto “Pillowcase” a la Biblioteca Pública de Cesar Chávez en Maywood este sábado, abril 7 a las 12PM.
