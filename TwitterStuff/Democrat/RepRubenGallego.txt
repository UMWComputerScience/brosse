Standing up at the #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch with thousands of people in #Phoenix and across the country to fight back against @realDonaldTrump’s cruel and unnecessary family separation and family incarceration policies. Tent camps and jails are no place for children. https://t.co/my8FfQyYhKI’m at a Bureau of Prisons facility in Phoenix where I will try to speak with immigrant detainees and hear their stories. Afterwards I’ll be sharing about my experience on Facebook Live. Tune in at https://t.co/vdcUNIIwNXNewsflash: Kids are still in cages at the border. Dreamers are still getting deported. While enjoying fireworks+BBQs w/ their families next week, I hope House Republicans will spare a thought for all of the people separated from their families b/c of Trump’s outrageous cruelty. https://t.co/nSVVd1Gm7ETrump justified the #MuslimBan by claiming his admin. had analyzed threats from 200+ countries. Justice Roberts then cited that analysis in his opinion on the ban. One problem: No one has seen it! Another problem: It's just 17 pages! We're demanding the secret Muslim Ban report. https://t.co/HajdMucUuOToday I met with #Colombia’s President-Elect @IvanDuque to talk about the important relationship between our 2 countries.

15 years ago today #SCOTUS invalidated discriminatory laws governing interactions between consenting adultsHappy pride month! While @POTUS refuses to step up and recognize these important pieces of our history, I’m a proud cosponsor of H.Res 405 to designate June 26 as #LGBTEquality Day!

The decision to uphold this blatant discrimination will be looked back on by future generations w/ shame. https://t.co/OlVA7IaIz1Since SCOTUS decided Shelby County v.

Thanks, @PepsiCo for helping these veterans transition from the battlefield to the classroom &amp; your dedication to the veteran workforce!I know firsthand how difficult it can be to transition back to civilian life after military service.

We need a president who's an ally in that fight.I’m glad the President feels good about himself. I wish he’d think less about what despots want and more about U.S. interests.Calling our exercises with the South Koreans "provocative"? Committing to "security guarantees" in exchange for a handshake with a lying, calculating dictator? If we emerge from this situation with a nuclear and legitimized North Korea and no Asian allies, what have we gained?President Trump is naïve. He promised Kim “security guarantees” while Kim didn’t say anything he hadn’t said already. Because he needed this meeting to be positive, he caved. Classic weak, know-nothing Trump.Scott Pruitt is either REALLY corrupt or he's opening DC’s weirdest B+B. Went to the House Floor on Friday with @RepTedLieu to break down the strangest Trump administration scandal yet. https://t.co/6pJvYg0UftPutting policy differences aside, when is the last time the GOP competently staffed and ran the government? 1991?

Nothing. https://t.co/rCFs7ibSnaThis Pruitt story sounds like something out of Veep. https://t.co/1m7C7TSvkw74 years ago, American, British, Canadian &amp; allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy to liberate Nazi-occupied Europe.

Small price to pay to get their ZTE slush company back up and running. Pay-to-play, this-for-that, quid-pro-quo. https://t.co/XDeEVzctdxRather than making the strong case for our national security interests and telling ZTE to sleep in the bed they made, Trump is letting them off the hook.This is crony capitalism, except the crony in this case is a foreign state-controlled corporation that is a threat to U.S. businesses and security.There’s no excuse for throwing allies under the bus, allowing the U.S. Ambassador to Germany to insult his hosts, and then letting a Chinese state-controlled enterprise off the hook for violating U.S. sanctions.Fines are a cost of doing business for Chinese state-controlled enterprises. https://t.co/ipRbZdO16JI had better access to resources in the middle of the desert as a Marine in Iraq than our fellow American citizens have in Puerto Rico post-Hurricane Maria.

Join us at First Church UCC, 1407 N 2nd St. Phoenix, 11 am.The American people deserve better than this.Trump seems increasingly unable to do the actual work of being President while dealing with his growing scandals and legal troubles. He seems unable to have a sustained focus on anything other than attacking the DOJ, FBI, and Special Counsel.I have strong concerns about the fitness of their Commander in Chief, what these strikes will actually achieve, his lack of legal authority in ordering this action, and his failure to develop a broader strategy for Syria.As a veteran of the Iraq War, I'm relieved that no US service members or allies were killed while executing last night's strike.

I appreciate your efforts to join me to elevate voices &amp; improve lives in #AZ07. https://t.co/h6QdO4VBE1…OR we could fund the desperately needed expansion of the veteran caregiver programs that support families caring for severely disabled veterans.We should increase access to life-saving mental health care for veterans returning from war and address the increasing suicide rate resulting from undiagnosed &amp; untreated mental health issues.Instead of spending billions on a wall that we don’t need, we could also address nutrition instability for the 1.5 million veterans on food stamps. Trump wants to slash this funding and make it harder for vets to put food on the table. 
https://t.co/0qyRVbbIOUUsing the National Guard to do border security is very expensive. For what it would cost the Guard to make just TWO arrests at the border, we could give a homeless veteran permanent housing for an entire year.I personally have seen the unmet needs of men &amp; women who return from war. I served alongside them. Instead of wasting money to send troops to the border, @realdonaldtrump should consider honoring his promise to veterans &amp; their families. A few ideas off the top of my head:.@realDonaldTrump wants to use our troops to advance his extreme anti-immigrant agenda, while wasting time, resources &amp; money and depleting our military strength in areas of real danger. Congress must stop this misguided scheme. https://t.co/Go1Kc0bouiSo glad Hector is coming home. But too many more veterans are still waiting to return to the country they served.

Without a doubt, Planned Parenthood and progressives have stepped up to meet that challenge. #IStandwithPPAA #Unstoppable @PPArizona https://t.co/R9HDHLTGpFTo recap what happened last year: https://t.co/Khj0UcE6pCLast year,I filed an amendment to prevent Trump using $$ for our troops to build his dumb wall. House GOP secretly killed it late at night. https://t.co/aCupVqUNrm#ICYMI, Trump tried to hide his shameful #TransMilitaryBan in a Friday news dump. It's spiteful, doesn't have military support, and hurts - not helps - readiness. It's unconstitutional and morally wrong.You’re not the leaders of tomorrow. You are the leaders now. Here. Today. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/IRGkJ2Ocb2Every Member of Congress who cares about keeping our brave men &amp; women in uniform out of harm’s way must strenuously oppose the appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor. https://t.co/xWxwHomwO5I’m joining @CNNSitRoom @wolfblitzer at 6 pm ET to talk about the Mueller investigation, Dowd’s resignation, the omnibus &amp; more. Tune in!As a Marine, I can’t let anyone walk by with a medal or pin that’s not on straight...including the Vice President. Thankfully, @JoeBiden was a good sport. Honored to meet with him to discuss how we can rebuild the American middle class. https://t.co/qlYC9tKeBt@JakeSherman Oh, I know. Just think it’s a Pyrrhic victory for Republicans given the actual impact on people’s lives and in light of this:

https://t.co/TkFAWfvR2qConservatives “won” on health care by ensuring higher prices and premiums for hardworking Americans. What kind of win is that? https://t.co/ayckr6EfwaEqual protection under the law belongs to everyone. Proud to cosponsor @RepJaredPolis’s Student Non-Discrimination Act. #LetKidsLearn #SNDAPutin's running an authoritarian regime. Trump just congratulated him on his "re-election." https://t.co/uAiBDEcNER#6MonthsAfterMaria, #PuertoRico is still in crisis. Tens of thousands of American citizens are still without permanent shelter, water or electricity. This is unacceptable. The Trump administration must be held accountable. https://t.co/25WdD8vDdMThese ancient petroglyphs are just one example of the tribal history on these lands. @realDonaldTrump doesn’t want to protect these sacred and historical treasures. #GallegoGoesToBearsEars https://t.co/nqWvNDvv6lToday I visited The Valley of the Gods, part of the area that will lose protection under @realDonaldTrump’s plan. #GallegoGoesToBearsEars https://t.co/VDjuCj4gHKI am wearing my combat boots from Iraq. Well, the second pair - the first I wore through. My fellow vets &amp; I use public lands to recharge &amp; recuperate after we come home from war. We need to protect these lands- part of the American legacy we fought for. #GallegoGoesToBearsEars https://t.co/y7zyzV42lIEating lunch with native youth who ran for a week to #SaveBearsEars. #GallegoGoesToBearsEars https://t.co/RCPyvST8IMJust in case there was any doubt that House Republicans would back Trump up in his attacks on the Justice Department, see: https://t.co/R6tC5t07GoMeeting with tribal leaders and discussing the need to #SaveBearsEars and protect our federal lands. #GallegoGoesToBearsEars https://t.co/forlKgcru1Hell no. https://t.co/v4dpsGF7PHKicking off a 2 hour drive to #BearsEars with Reps. @IselaBlancAZ and @ericdescheenie. We’ll be meeting first with tribal leaders who have been ignored by @realDonaldTrump. #GallegoGoesToBearsEars https://t.co/lYCubY7l6A.@realDonaldTrump gutted protections for #BearsEars without listening to local tribes &amp; residents. I’m headed this weekend to see for myself the sacred tribal sites &amp; federal lands the Trump admin is trying to sell. Follow along at #GallegoGoesToBearsEars. https://t.co/RpTEyYqiYKSad to hear of the passing of my colleague and friend @LouiseSlaughter. She was a powerful voice in Congress throughout her truly impressive career. My sincere condolences to her family and loved ones.Horrifying. Hate has no place in our community. I'm glad law enforcement officials are acting swiftly to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice and the Mosque and its attendees are safe. https://t.co/asggHY96G7#Phoenix students are tired of waiting for Congress to take action to save lives - and so am I. Congress needs to take real and immediate action to address gun violence and keep our children safe. #EnoughIsEnough #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/o1ws3kMnGWProud to stand up against gun violence with America's students on #NationalWalkoutDay. Your leadership is inspiring. #NotOneMore https://t.co/fdDXq9UDywTo the brave students taking a stand for change on #NationalWalkoutDay: We hear you. We see you. And we're joining you today, walking out of the U.S. Capitol in solidarity. Watch here: https://t.co/LG4QAxkmcCMy statement on the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson: https://t.co/JtWooEGLQuShameless Friday clickbait. https://t.co/hyrlH13G5fI'm talking with @wolfblitzer on @CNNSitRoom now to discuss @realDonaldTrump's tariffs, the Stormy Daniels payout, and Trump's attempts to derail the Mueller investigation. Tune in!I want to live in an America where if you want to carry an assault weapon, you need to visit this website first: https://t.co/uYTvn5BXyX https://t.co/u8NCIAUM7rThank you, Sakshi, @DefendOurFuture and all of the young people out there. Keep up the good work! https://t.co/mgFz1zN0Uw9A: Your voices matter. Staying engaged is critical. Meet with your lawmakers; write and call them. Educate yourself on the issues. Vote.9A: I hear you, and I hope my colleagues in Congress and the thousands of elected officials across the country are listening as well.9A: Young people have so much at stake. To protect our children and future generations, we need to #ActOnClimate now. https://t.co/7OmigEyOo5A8: But it’s not just about his travel. @EPAScottPruitt is under numerous investigations for actions he’s taken in office – working in his own self-interest at the expense of the environment. He’s unfit for public office and he needs to go.A8: I’m glad that he’s now traveling coach. His misuse of taxpayer dollars to fund first-class travel and accommodations is completely unacceptable. https://t.co/vTrEYiDD76A7: Let’s be clear: @EPAScottPruitt’s toxic agenda is burdening taxpayers and future generations with the costs of climate change, pollution, and recovery costs from extreme weather.A7: I am not impressed, to say the least. By rolling back environmental &amp; public health safeguards, it’s clear that @EPAScottPruitt is putting the interests of polluters before the health of our communities. https://t.co/y5EDMMgw6AA6: We know that pollution disproportionately impacts communities of color and low-income communities. Slashing funding to EPA’s EJ programs would be devastating for the people who live in neighborhoods impacted by pollution. #Latinos4CPP https://t.co/kxbg3FaTsvA5: This is a real problem. Arizona has a backlog of more than 750 leaking underground storage tanks. EPA support has been essential to monitoring these tanks and ensuring that polluters pay their fair share of cleanup costs. https://t.co/TOeSBjwS0oA4: Cutting staff and hobbling EPA’s ability to hold polluters accountable means that entire communities would be at greater risk from hazardous pollutants in our water, air and soil.A4: The proposed budget slashes funding that supports state and local air quality monitoring programs. Cleaner air means fewer Cod Red days on which parents must keep kids indoors, and fewer asthma attacks for the 175,000 Arizona children diagnosed with asthma.A4: EPA’s budget is already at its lowest levels in decades while its responsibilities have increased significantly. The president’s proposal would threaten our health, our communities and undermine the growing clean energy economy.A4: President Trump's proposal is wrong for a number of reasons, and we certainly can’t cover all of them in this conversation. I oppose cutting @EPA’s budget. https://t.co/tx4bDQf6X0A3: Even if you can’t be in Gillette, WY, on March 27th for the last listening session on the repeal of the #CPP, you can still submit a comment – more than 500,000 have already done so: https://t.co/rkjWQsfS8L. https://t.co/mkvHPuE0d5A2: A lot of companies have already taken steps to meet their responsibilities under the #CPP. Repealing it now would be a reckless move that would hurt those companies that have taken responsible steps to innovate and include enviro-conscious development in their bottom line.A2: In my district, more than 10,000 are employed in clean energy industries and $149M has been invested. The #CPP encourages clean energy innovation and that means more job opportunities for everyone, including people living in underserved communities. #Latinos4CPPA2: One analysis by @E2 found that repealing the Clean Power Plan could cost as many as 560,000 jobs and $52 billion in economic activity nationwide in 2030. #ProtectCPP https://t.co/vRjh7nZ3X6A1: Finally, our actions have very real consequences for communities around the world who look to the United States for leadership on this issue. We should step up and join other nations who have made and are sticking to their commitments to act on climate change. #ProtectCPPA1: We also have a duty to protect our environment so that future generations can enjoy the outdoors and inherit a healthier, safer planet. #ProtectCPPA1: It’s a matter of public health. The #CPP aims to reduce harmful pollution &amp; improve air quality. Smog &amp; air pollution cause increased incidence of asthma, heart attacks, premature deaths – which disproportionately affect low income people &amp; ppl of color. We must #ProtectCPP https://t.co/ZsAXyIXEu8It's my pleasure! https://t.co/9p4dBK3LzjRepublicans and their bosses at the NRA believe almost anyone should be able to carry weapons of war - firearms designed to kill the most people in the shortest time. That's idiotic. I'm heading to the House floor shortly to explain why.Follow the conversation on Twitter today at 3 pm! #Latinos4Climate #ProtectCPP #ActOnClimate https://t.co/ES5XTaO7Ya.@realDonaldTrump knows exactly what he’s doing. And he thinks he can continue to get away with it. We can’t let him.Now Trump won’t even take action to stop Russia from meddling in our 2018 elections. If it worked out for him once… https://t.co/dCN9LMYSBdThe State Department was granted $120 million to counter foreign interference in our elections. It has spent $0. Not one of the 23 people on the project speaks Russian. https://t.co/SN5vEPPrGLAnd all the while, Trump is sending a loud and clear message to Russia: Do whatever you want, because we won’t impose sanctions anyway. https://t.co/so26QvFlPBTrump’s plan for a cyber partnership with Russia? Even his own party thought that was a dumb idea. https://t.co/ucF8Zjqfc8From Trump’s mouth [directly] to the Kremlin’s ear: He literally gave away highly classified intelligence secrets to the Russian ambassador – in the Oval Office. https://t.co/TvcaL5IODISecretary of State Rex Tillerson made a name for himself while president of Exxon Mobile by making deals with…you guessed it, Russia. https://t.co/FoWfUALfzpTime and again, he’s appointed top officials with deep ties to Russia. https://t.co/htYJLlmTG6His national security adviser Michael Flynn received multiple payments from Russia, and had to resign after questionable contacts with Russia’s ambassador and Russian government entities. https://t.co/jFqixKZpRiHis son in law, No-Clearance Kushner, tried to establish a “secret communications channel” between Trump’s transition team and Moscow. https://t.co/YjrNHcd2wX5 months into his presidency, @realDonaldTrump asked the National Security Council to come up with “deliverables” he could offer to Putin. https://t.co/h8XKeBd9PCLet’s dispel, once and for all, the fiction that @realDonaldTrump doesn’t know what he’s doing. He knows exactly what he’s doing.More info here: https://t.co/3jG8ruJakYThe worst thing about @realDonaldTrump using the federal budget as his personal piggy bank is we can't even say for sure how much $$$ has gone from the Treasury straight into his pocket. We intro'd the CORRUPT Act to force Trump to disclose how he's profiting from the presidency. https://t.co/ZjzHQRdRjQ#Dreamers are human beings, not political bargaining chips. The GOP needs to fix the mess they created. My statement: https://t.co/XeYIzYesWrToday is March 5th - Trump's arbitrary deadline to Congress to pass legislation to fix the #DACA crisis he created. Paul Ryan &amp; Mitch McConnell have failed to act and Dreamers face an uncertain future. It's time for the GOP to step up &amp; do their jobs. https://t.co/6ER2xxukiEVeterans deserve competent, functioning leadership at the VA - not ideologues pushing a privatization agenda that #vets &amp; experts staunchly oppose. @realDonaldTrump should fire those officials. https://t.co/gpeYlEyZAlTrump-style populism could now literally become toxic for the communities who supported him. https://t.co/pPgc6rjP7oTrump WH officials seem to have three exit ramps from the White House:
 
Door 1 – Unceremonious firing
Door 2 – Resigning in disgrace
Door 3 – Indictment https://t.co/fRLIrn3nTSDeregulating polluters; gutting national monuments; slashing funding for the Park Service. Interior @SecretaryZinke said he was a conservationist, but this infographic tells the true story #OurWild #PublicLands https://t.co/qIXW24HJE7Revoking Kushner’s security clearance isn’t gonna cut it. Kushner has got to go. https://t.co/lPYz43PkYsAnd now this. So what DOES Jared have to do to get fired? https://t.co/HtDCXvJ36fSo how does Jared fix the Middle East with a revoked security clearance? https://t.co/RWylg8FV7eEnough is enough. The American people are fed up with the unprecedented corruption of @realDonaldTrump and his administration. 

RT this thread if you think it’s time to ACT.Should taxpayers be paying nearly $100K so that Eric Trump can take a (private) business trip to Uruguay? https://t.co/HWipq4zEBzShould taxpayers be paying more than $100K for Tiffany Trump to vacation with her boyfriend in Italy? https://t.co/Vi8oXHum4hThe Secret Service couldn’t even pay all of its agents, in part due to extra travel expenses for the Trump family. https://t.co/wOskJue2YyTrump’s frequent trips to his private resorts – including Mar-a-Lago and his NJ golf club – have cost taxpayers millions of dollars. https://t.co/p49LEDwrHyThis kind of culture comes from the top. When @realDonaldTrump and his family spend millions of taxpayer dollars for personal benefit without consequence, his aides think they can get away with it too.And it’s not just travel. The EPA spend nearly $25K to install a secure phone booth for Scott Pruitt. No EPA administrator before him ever had that kind of setup. https://t.co/7PHiVRzYo1.@realDonaldTrump also let Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin keep his job after he tried to use a government jet costing taxpayers $25K/hour for his honeymoon.
https://t.co/Jd87mgVLnIBut @realDonaldTrump let HHS Secretary Tom Price keep his job after he took at least 24 flights on private charter planes, costing taxpayers more than $300K.
https://t.co/HSZLBbPqhzMisuse of taxpayer $ used to be a fireable offense.
 
Clinton fired WH director of admin after he used a Marine One helicopter to travel to a private golf course.

George HW Bush fired his Chief of Staff in part bc he wasted taxpayer $ on travel bills.

https://t.co/q8gDcd0lX7Under most administrations, this type of news would be shocking. But it’s just another example of the rampant abuse of taxpayer $ by the Trump regime.A HUD official was fired after she refused to illegally fund an expensive redecoration of Ben Carson’s office with taxpayer $.
 
Carson reportedly told her “$5,000 will not buy a decent chair.”
 
How many of you have bought a $5K office chair?

https://t.co/7kxosEDrhc.@realDonaldTrump and his administration are living large on the taxpayers’ dime. This is unacceptable and we can’t let them get away with it..@CillizzaCNN This is only part of the story! Because of nepotism, Jared + Ivanka got easy access to our nation’s secrets, despite being vulnerable to foreign coercion through their overseas business interests and debts. That’s why I intro’d Family Security Clearance Review Act. https://t.co/fvvI0zX2FFWhile today’s #DACA ruling is good news for some, this is only a temporary protection, and not for all. Congress must still act to provide permanent protections for Dreamers &amp; end the manufactured crisis Trump created. https://t.co/fPPsz1t6eT73 years ago today, Marines on Iwo Jima raised the flag atop Mount Suribachi.
