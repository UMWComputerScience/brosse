We absolutely need to punish bad actors like China for their unfair trade practices, but the Trump Administration’s reckless tariffs on our allies are igniting a trade war that will cost American jobs. https://t.co/AUKRXt1Gu5After 5 of their colleagues were murdered, Capital Gazette reporters honored their memory the only way they knew how: they did their jobs &amp; published the paper. It’s time Congress does its job. We must debate measures to reduce gun violence in our communities.  #HonorwithAction https://t.co/Hev5wQQfsmMy heart goes out to the victims and families affected by this horrific newsroom shooting in Maryland. As we await more details, it remains true that Congress has the power to save lives by taking steps to reduce gun violence in our communities. We must find the courage to act. https://t.co/uNsFI1Sn11Questioning FBI Director Wray and Deputy AG Rosenstein about our efforts to improve election security. Despite President Trump's tweets, foreign interference is a real threat and we need to take it seriously. https://t.co/hK0vGTcXfQTogether with @SenatorDurbin and @SenDuckworth, I sent a letter urging the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure all laws and regulations are followed and the full environmental impacts are considered. #FoxconnLast July, more than 3,200 homes were damaged by the flooding of the Des Plaines River. We need to make sure the #Foxconn development just over the border in WI does not make things worse for our communities downstream. https://t.co/p7MON1BUsIThis is ridiculous. Why does President Trump continue to believe Vladimir Putin’s lies over the unanimous conclusion of our intelligence professionals? We need to take action now to improve election security and dissuade future interference. #DETERAct https://t.co/P02tOkR1qUJust 2 yrs ago, Sen. McConnell said voters should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice and refused to consider nominee until after election. Now, with a vacancy even closer to the next election, he should follow same precedent.  https://t.co/C8SS7TGj2x https://t.co/CmeYt3sFvMCongrats to Jocelyn Duvon, a senior at @waukHS, who is the 2018 Congressional Art Competition winner for our district. She's visiting DC today to see her artwork hung in the Capitol next to winners from across the country. I'll be proudly pointing it out for the next year! #IL10 https://t.co/V687PUAsloGlad to celebrate a century of US-Armenia friendship and cooperation last night with @armembusa @ANCA_DC #Armenian https://t.co/ylJTStBjo8Yet more proof that attempting to fix immigration with an extreme one-party approach will end in failure. Speaker Ryan needs to bring up the bipartisan #USAAct, which could pass the House with support from both sides of the aisle, for a vote immediately. #protectdreamers #DACA https://t.co/tA2MReJ5fEThank you Naomi and family for visiting and sharing your story! https://t.co/Nij6RAWInwWe cannot go back to a time when insurance companies could discriminate against people like Ola and the more than 130 million Americans with a pre-existing condition. #ProtectOurCareI was so inspired by the bravery of Ola Ojewumi as I listened to her share her story today. She received a kidney and heart transplant at age 11 and lymphoma diagnosis at age 25, and has not just survived but thrived. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/4i5dggVhJ8This is a sad day for hard-working Americans including teachers, firefighters, police officers, civil servants, and more – good people who serve our public every day. #JANUSvsAFSCME #JanusUnions helped build our nation’s middle class, but  today’s ruling fits a pattern of attacks to undermine labor and working families, and weaken workers’ right to negotiate for better pay, working conditions, medical benefits, retirement benefits, and paid leave. #UnionStrongIn their decision, the Justices brushed aside more than four decades of legal precedent and denied unions the ability to collect ‘fair share fees’ for the services and benefits they provide to all workers, regardless of union membership. #JANUSvsAFSCME #JanusToday’s ruling by the Supreme Court is an attack on the right of public sector workers to negotiate for decent pay and workplace protections. #JANUSvsAFSCME #Janus https://t.co/ePIW7DX3l0Our national debt is on track to reach unprecedented levels, and the recently passed tax law is accelerating the problem. This is a threat to the future we pass on to our children. We must come together to chart a more sustainable course for our budget. https://t.co/VwHRSU9x4RToday marks 3 years since the Supreme Court ruled marriage equality the law of the land. Let's build on our progress by passing the Equality Act to institute federal non-discrimination protections for all #LGBTQ Americans. #EqualityForward https://t.co/7f0I2otajeI support continuing to improve our screening processes for those admitted into the United States, but arbitrarily banning entry from certain Muslim-majority countries and barring refugees fleeing terror is both ineffective and an insult to our national values.During the campaign, then candidate Trump was clear he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the United States. I’m deeply disappointed the Supreme Court today ruled to uphold a travel ban rooted in religious discrimination. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/EAjxvSzkDwWe need to compensate our #vetearns of the #VietnamWar dealing with the health effects of exposure to Agent Orange and other toxic chemicals. I'm a co-sponsor of this legislation and am pleased it passed the House yesterday. https://t.co/b5bEds0egEI'm proud to co-sponsor the Voting Rights Advancement Act because every American must be guaranteed a voice in our democracy. #RestoreTheVOTESince the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v.

I’m committed to protecting and strengthening the GI Bill.Today the House passed legislation on the opioid crisis, including a measure I've co-sponsored to help prevent fraudulent prescriptions.

I invite my colleagues in the majority to abandon their one-sided approach and work across the aisle to find a constructive way forward to meet our nation’s critical agricultural and nutritional needs.We know that #SNAP leads to better health and education outcomes, yet an estimated 2 million families would see their benefits reduced or eliminated entirely under today's partisan #FarmBill.  https://t.co/7lWaxGzoqsI'm glad the extreme Goodlatte bill failed. There are bipartisan immigration solutions available that could pass the House - including the #USAAct - it's time for GOP leadership to stop the obstruction. https://t.co/DbfyF8pUhDGlad to meet with local small business owners visiting DC with @NFIB to discuss taxes and health care. https://t.co/COSMtvtxmpWith the start of summer, we're launching our second-annual Brad's Bookworms reading program challenging elementary-age students to read 10 books with help from their family.

That’s why we support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. https://t.co/irCecmYTCeThis morning, I spoke in the House about the Keep Families Together Act that I introduced with my colleagues to put a stop to the abhorrent policy ripping apart parents and children on our border. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/aNJx0M2FWxUnder President Trump, the United States is on track to resettle the lowest number of refugees than any year since 1977. We must do better.

We rode from Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago through Lake Bluff and Lake Forest to Fort Sheridan. And cooled down with some ice cream from Sweet Pea's in Highwood before turning around. https://t.co/YU3Pa8QPkqThe Trump Administration's decision to separate parents and children at the border is cruel and an affront to our American values.

I'm concerned Pres Trump has granted legitimacy to NK on world stage &amp; given up joint exercises w/ our ally S Korea, in return for just shallow promisesI always support diplomacy as the best means to achieve our national goals. Today's #SingaporeSummit was a positive step toward hopefully reducing tensions and eliminating the nuclear threat on the Korean Peninsula.Today marks two years since the terrible shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando that cut short 49 innocent lives. As we remember and mourn, we must also #HonorThemWithAction by standing with our LGBT community to #DisarmHate and finally passing legislation to reduce gun violence. https://t.co/muUVyMk6hvThank you Des Plaines for joining our most recent #CongressonYourCorner this morning at Cumberland Elementary. https://t.co/2IVACxUH2yLots of friendly faces at @mgfarmersmarket on opening day! #MortonsGrove #IL10 https://t.co/8bXdV0altrJoin the conversation this Saturday in Des Plaines.

If you need help with an issue involving the federal government - from Social Security and Medicare to the VA and more -- come visit us when we're in your community https://t.co/WHyWQouUNHThank you Dundee Pharmacy for inviting me to visit and learn more about the challenges and opportunities facing independent community pharmacies on the front lines of our health care system. #BradAtYourBusinessGood visiting with the team at Genoa Pharmacy at @LakeCoHealth to learn about their work in our community and innovative approach to improving patient compliance with prescriptions. #BradAtYourBusiness https://t.co/5hXtr9w6OTSending Independence Day greetings to Greece - one of the US's stalwart allies for two centuries.  The Eastern Mediterranean, the Balkans, Europe and the world are safer when the US and Greece stand together.  Ζήτω η Ελλάς 🇬🇷🇺🇸@HellenicLeadersOur office is accepting student entries in the annual Congressional Art Competition until April 13. I can't wait to see this year's submissions! https://t.co/VCJGmJmeHHShameful. Transgender individuals are defending our country now with honor. President Trump need to learn that any capable individual who volunteers to wear the uniform deserves our gratitude, not our prejudice. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/ACboXFabUfGreat visit this morning at @ThorntonsInc in Fox Lake to talk with the team and even serve a few customers. Fuel retailing and convenience stores employee around 3,200 people in 200 stores across #IL10, so I appreciated this chance to learn more. #NACSinStore #BradAtYourBusiness https://t.co/e4pWpDoXIiAre you a high school student interested in attending a U.S. Military Service Academy? Join me at our upcoming information session on the application and nomination process! https://t.co/UUUftJZH5cGlad to meet yesterday with local advocates from the American Diabetes Association. I’m proud to support federal research programs at NIH and elsewhere to help prevent and cure the disease. https://t.co/oklnCAxgw2Always glad to spend time with young people participating in YouthBuild Lake County. Today’s omnibus bill included funding for this important program. https://t.co/b2tU4zmCj7I voted for today’s omnibus spending bill to avoid a government shutdown and fund priorities critical to Tenth District communities. https://t.co/eC4BP7oKcKStanding with my @HouseJudDems colleagues to warn President Trump not to interfere in the Mueller investigation. Doing so would undermine the rule of law and hurt our efforts to protect future elections. #ProtectMueller https://t.co/hwnxBeRymJTerrorist tunnel networks represent an increasingly sophisticated and dangerous threat to the safety and security of our ally Israel. Proud to lead a group of my colleagues advocating for robust funding for the joint U.S.-Israeli counter-tunnel program. https://t.co/oZM9j2jDgnWe can’t effectively protect our future elections if we don’t understand the full extent of Russia’s meddling in our past elections, and hold those responsible to account. That's why Special Counsel Mueller's investigation must continue unhindered to completion.Pres. Trump has shown a disregard for the independence of the Mueller investigation &amp; willingness to undermine its work. This bill would help protect the special counsel and send clear message that Congress will not tolerate a politically-motivated firing. https://t.co/f5H23gHdcUThis debt is unsustainable &amp; poses a looming threat to the next generation. While economy is growing and unemployment is low, we need to come together with a focus on getting our fiscal house in order and charting a responsible course for our budget. 
 
https://t.co/aR7pWwYVXiMy heart is sinking reading news of yet another school shooting. I pray for the safety of the students, teachers, and staff. This cannot become America’s new normal #EnoughisEnough

https://t.co/DTYezvCMSCCalling back some of the individuals who took the time to write our office over the past week. Finding solutions for gun safety continues to be the most frequent topic that I hear from constituents. Send me a message through our website: https://t.co/JYAp0E1M3b https://t.co/WZZUFnznT4Our constituent service representatives will be throughout the district this week during Neighborhood Office Hours. If you need help with an issue involving the federal government - from Social Security and Medicare to the VA and more -- come visit us when we're in your community https://t.co/gg0yVEs7b0The annual Navy @seaperch Challenge at @navstaglakes is always such a great event. So impressed watching students this weekend from across Illinois compete with underwater robotics they built themselves. #STEMEducation https://t.co/9JhI8paCWFProud to stand with @MomsDemand and students across the Tenth District who are working to reduce gun violence and save lives. https://t.co/2axUcRnnIlGood conversation this morning in Glencoe for our most recent Congress on Your Corner. https://t.co/e5GNldxBNKHappy St. Patrick’s Day! 🍀 https://t.co/XBD45fzwjxGlad to join meeting of Senior Service Coalition of Lake County which seeks to connect local senior organizations with state and national resources. https://t.co/LPX7bKLHwDCongratulations to the @girlscouts, which this week celebrates its 106th anniversary. More than 50 million young women have benefited from the program since its founding, growing as leaders and learning outdoor skills, STEM education, entrepreneurship and more. #GirlScoutsDayI'm always looking to hear from constituents. Join the conversation at our next Congress on Your Corner this Saturday morning in Glencoe! https://t.co/xjOHICDqmNI’m deeply saddened to learn Louise Slaughter has passed away. I came to know her as a real friend, but she was first a fierce advocate for her constituents, a kind mentor to her colleagues, and a trailblazer for women everywhere. She will be greatly missed by all who knew her. https://t.co/aIN37cUTAcJust one month left until Tax Day. Check out this list of sites throughout the Tenth District where free filing help is available from IRS-certified volunteers. https://t.co/HGBLdqpNc7 https://t.co/qj1hXPlCfQPoland's history during the Holocaust needs to be studied and reckoned with, not suppressed with threats of criminal prosecution. Read my op-ed in @TIME with @WhipHoyer and @RepDavidEPrice urging Poland to repeal its censorship law. https://t.co/SvEEIj0emgThese sanctions are more than justified and long overdue. I hope this signals the start of a real effort from President Trump and his Administration to punish Russia for their interference in 2016 and protect our elections in 2018 from further meddling. We can't stop here. https://t.co/ZljK8YFMI5I'm looking forward to the conversation at this weekend's Congress on Your Corner in Village of Glencoe. Hope to see you there Saturday morning! https://t.co/XsipBevCGZVery proud the bipartisan school safety proposal I introduced w/ @RepBost passed the House today. Now it's time to build on this progress with sensible gun laws to keep our students and communities safe. https://t.co/0hID6gHHTOToday, I spoke in support of a bipartisan school safety proposal I introduced with @RepBost help schools acquire panic buttons to alert first responders in an emergency. This is just a step in the right direction - addressing school security requires gun safety legislation. https://t.co/XTk2tTe1cYMeeting some of the students at today’s walkout outside the Capitol demanding action on gun violence prevention. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/mCqsWapMR4Good discussion today on education and infrastructure with Mayor Leon Rockingham and North Chicago Aldermen Bob Runnels, Carl Evans and Bobby Allen. https://t.co/jTlXagrQFJThere are 7,000 pairs of shoes outside the Capitol today. One for each of the children killed by gun violence across our country since Sandy Hook. We can save lives with common sense gun safety measures. It’s time for Congress to find the courage to act. #NotOneMore https://t.co/0Gj4TzMtRRWe face pressing security challenges across the globe, from North Korea to the Middle East to Russian interference in our elections. The United States needs a fully-resourced, motivated and effective State Department.I hope Secretary-Designate Pompeo will end the damaging, unjustifiable cuts to our diplomatic and development corps, and bring more clarity to our vital relationships with our allies and rest of the world. https://t.co/74k86aPPjBThanks Indian Trails Public Library District for inviting me to drop in on storytime this morning. We read “Mae Among the Stars” about Mae Jamison, the first African-American woman to travel to space. #WomensHistoryMonth2018 https://t.co/8jqQlccA2XOur constituent service representatives will be throughout the district this week during Neighborhood Office Hours.

We are too! Follow us at: https://t.co/9XODANycUO https://t.co/uAFKFXRzKRLots of friendly faces and dogs at the Pancakes for PAWS 8k in Glencoe this morning to benefit animal welfare work of @PAWSChicago. https://t.co/33r2XiP6pCClosed out the day with Mrs. Russell’s 4th Grade class at Gavin Elementary where students are learning about the history of the American flag. Isabella gave me a flag pin she made and I told her I will wear it the next time I speak on the House floor. https://t.co/0df8czumdYSpeaking with students at Gavin South Jr High School for our third stop on today’s education tour. https://t.co/PEiVhG394yDropped by to hear about the projects students are working on in the business incubator program at Round Lake High School, including a T-Shirt company, project delivery service, and websites for local restaurants. https://t.co/RqiNSbNpA0I’m back home in #IL10 today and kicked off a day of school visits at @cristorey in Waukegan. Students had great questions about reducing gun violence and reaching solutions on immigration. https://t.co/1ptBU4APNTTalking infrastructure investment with IUOE Local 150 last night. Thanks for having me.@Local150 https://t.co/Ma1kebABfnThose who traffic in bigotry, intolerance, and anti-Semitism, such as Louis Farrakhan, have no place in our national discourse. We have a moral responsibility to call out and condemn all who promote hatred and division. https://t.co/9pxaqVjYVdA cool project to celebrate the lives of women who were overlooked in the first draft of history. #InternationalWomensDay

https://t.co/FE5ATkXqgzInternational Women's Day is a time to celebrate the path-breaking women who led the way to the progress we enjoy today, and recommit ourselves to fighting for full gender equality and greater empowerment &amp; opportunity for women and girls around the world. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/Ku276Vzj9OIt’s #GreatLakesDay! Glad to speak with advocates this morning and discuss bipartisan work to protect the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and stop invasive species. https://t.co/sQWJMFGgbsDeadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl are a growing problem in the #opioidcrisis. Today I led a bipartisan letter with 18 colleagues to support next-generation antidote research to counter these ever more dangerous synthetic opioids. https://t.co/axYSDbyfOaGood meeting today with these Illinois veterans on the Hill today with the VFW. @VFWHQ https://t.co/5Z407ToGY1Defending our elections against foreign interference is not a partisan issue, it’s about protecting our democracy. https://t.co/wVdRLHNPSMThe @Boots2Business program helps equip members of the military to start and grow businesses after leaving the service. Today, I introduced bipartisan legislation with @RepRodBlum to support this important #veterans program. https://t.co/w75czCSDC1 https://t.co/5biVGaelW3Great to talk with so many constituents visiting DC today with @AIPAC about the importance of strengthening and promoting the US-Israel relationship. https://t.co/qFO8bfYjN2Early primary voting is already underway in Illinois, but there’s no sign the Trump Administration is serious about the threat of election interference. We need to act now to strengthen election defenses for 2018 and deter interference from Russia &amp; others. https://t.co/09mJeXNetNToday is President Trump's self-imposed deadline to end #DACA protections. Rather than sabotaging good-faith efforts to resolve this situation, President Trump should embrace bipartisan proposals like the #USAAct that would both #ProtectDreamers and our border security. https://t.co/T5YaYagxf5Another sign the Trump Administration is not taking the threat of foreign interference seriously. Russia's efforts in 2016 were an attack on our democracy, and we have to act now to defend against further meddling in 2018. https://t.co/pDUmdpqnTjThis week our constituent service representatives will be in Deerfield and Waukegan ready to assist with any issues involving the federal government. We're always available at (847) 383-4870 or check the schedule to find when we'll be in your neighborhood: https://t.co/Fi9m8umxSj https://t.co/kwREEF1OotProud to work alongside organizations like the @LCVoters  to protect our environment and address global climate change. #LCV https://t.co/zaaZLSYyOTVietnam veterans, please join me on May 12 at the Indian Trails Public Library for a commemoration ceremony to honor your service. More details here: https://t.co/BnY15aYZmL https://t.co/Lr8lw16paxProud to announce that my record on animal welfare issues in 2017 earned a 💯 rating from @HumaneSociety. Here’s a photo from my visit to @EC_therapy in Lake Forest last year. https://t.co/FzRBuWPLdPAs Tax Day quickly approaches, IRS-certified volunteers are available in various locations around our district providing free basic income tax return preparation with electronic filing. https://t.co/HGBLdqpNc7 https://t.co/mZTj9MxIX6Happy Read Across America Day! What are you doing today motivate and excite young people to pick up a book? #ReadAcrossAmerica https://t.co/8Ai8VEGcHlExcited to kick off the 2018 Congressional Art Competition for area high school students - the winner will hang in the U.S. Capitol for the year. Our schools are full of fantastically creative students and I can't wait to see what you create! https://t.co/y7k4TiXk95 https://t.co/GWvFEA5KQWRosalind Franklin, a researcher and chemist, completed groundbreaking x-ray experiments that became the foundation for the discovery of the structure of DNA. @RFUniversity in North Chicago is named in her honor. #WomensHistoryMonth #WomenInSTEM https://t.co/izwzqcBFqXThere are solutions available to save lives and reduce #gunviolence in our communities. We need hearings at @HouseJudiciary. The time for action is now. #GunReformNow https://t.co/tPc9K2WblBSharing an update on some of my work this week to reduce gun violence and address the opioid epidemic in our communities. https://t.co/TobadJI3I3Proud of the Illinois House for taking bipartisan action on commonsense gun safety measures. Now it's time for Congress to act! https://t.co/z6ydbLyCxyVery pleased @HouseCommerce @EnergyCommerce is holding a hearing today on the Opioid PACE Act that I introduced. This bill would help ensure doctors have the latest knowledge on preventing, detecting, and treating opioid abuse through continuing education. #opioidcrisis https://t.co/OBuH4r6r7WRussia’s interference in our election was a malicious attack. It’s mind-boggling that Pres. Trump won't act. Congress needs to step up – the bipartisan #DETERAct would help stop additional aggression by establishing punishing sanctions for future interference by Putin and others. https://t.co/s0c95C5qsBGood meeting with @ILfoodbank today about defending SNAP and other programs that are vital to solving hunger in our communities. https://t.co/X1kve5QB4xListening today to the stories of students from Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Florida. I am so inspired by their courage to create positive change out of this tragedy. Congress must end the obstruction and take action to reduce gun violence in our communities. #StonemanStrong https://t.co/VmZx0jcv9SI spent time this morning calling principals and superintendents at Tenth District schools to hear how they and their students are reacting to the Parkland shooting and how I can support their work to keep our students safe. https://t.co/9XCCZBWOLwAssault weapons like those used in Parkland, Las Vegas, &amp; Newtown are weapons of war. They have no place on our streets or in our schools. @RepCicilline's bill is a commonsense step to protect our children &amp; keep military-style weapons out our communities. https://t.co/YrvXKGLkWG
