Workers have a right to unionize in order to negotiate pay, benefits, and workplace protections and have been a leading driver in creating America’s middle class. #unionstrong https://t.co/9N6ps7syo2Very pleased to have had the support of so many of my colleagues in the House today to pass my Endangered Salmon &amp; Fisheries Predation Prevention Act to tackle the issue posed by sea lion predation in the PNW in a bipartisan, thoughtful way. #SaveOurSalmon https://t.co/2uoM1SmBFNToday is the 3rd anniversary of marriage equality becoming law of the land but LGBTQ people are still at risk of being fired from their job or denied housing. This is unacceptable. The #EqualityAct would extend existing civil rights protections to LGBTQ people. #EqualityForward https://t.co/9NI86uCGY4Let’s make one thing clear: yesterday the President didn’t fix the immigration problem &amp; this House is not fixing the problem today. https://t.co/o042enGl1CI also joined my Oregon colleagues to demand AG Sessions immediately reverse the administration’s zero-tolerance policy that’s left asylum seekers dumped in federal prisons like the one in Sheridan.

Thanks to all of you who came to chat with me about the issues that you see in the country and what I can do to serve you in the United States Congress https://t.co/Jrke4t9QtSDoing this doesn’t just go against every American value but every human value we hold. The President needs to end this horrific policy, which never should have been a policy to begin with, immediately!There is absolutely no reason to separate families or take small children away from their parents at the border. This totally unnecessary and cruel action calls to mind horrible decisions from history and it disturbs me to my core.I'll be hosting a telephone town hall this Wednesday at 6pm PDT.
