Despite this tragedy, the Capital Gazette team still published a special edition paper dedicated to their colleagues. We should all strive for that kind of courage and commitment.

Congress, especially, can honor these victims with action on #GunSafety.
https://t.co/IVAgdZ6D99Local reporters do invaluable work to keep us informed and hold those in power accountable to the truth. Our hearts are with the #CapitalGazette and the families of Wendi, Rebecca, Gerald, Rob, and John. 
https://t.co/VS1fOXeJQOEach June, we celebrate the stories of generations who have come to America seeking a better life. Without these immigrants, San Diego and communities across the country would not be what they are today. #ImmigrantHeritageMonth https://t.co/nABwQvTX26This second grader from San Diego is already making his mark in the tech industry! Congrats, Mihir, on winning the 2018 @EdisonAwards Inventor’s Challenge.
https://t.co/rpaoPS1g7G@RepDerekKilmer It helps address the growing skills gap by allowing workers to make tax-free contributions and withdrawals for eligible education expenses. Employers are able to attract and retain talent while boosting productivity and global competitiveness.Helped introduce the Skills Investment with @RepDerekKilmer to equip workers with the skills and training they need to stay competitive in a changing economy. https://t.co/N2Zh2ZMwPhI want to thank Justice Kennedy for his independent jurisprudence and service to our country. I hope the president will nominate a candidate of similar caliber and fairness, who will carefully consider the merits of each case and focus less on ideology.
https://t.co/txDEmtjijqI hope this ruling can inspire my Republican colleagues to stand up for what is legal and what is right. Proud San Diego is on the right side of history. #KeepFamiliesTogether
https://t.co/8Fqub6DLX9@HHSGov This follows a letter I sent with my colleagues to the Office of Refugee Resettlement expressing concern over the well-being of children in their care. The stress and trauma of separation can have life-long effects on children. https://t.co/2NkVgSlGZ3Thankfully, @HHSGov announced they are launching a review of conditions at migrant shelters to ensure children are safe while in federal custody. 
https://t.co/Vsmx579WEfDisappointed in my Republican colleagues, who refused to stand against this cruel policy. At the very least, we should agree these children deserve adequate food, clothing, and counseling to prevent further trauma. https://t.co/I8QhZAaAMvHuge thank you to @SenToniAtkins for getting @sdschools funding to support their homeless students. Denying this funding because of a missing signature was wrong. I'm glad the students won't suffer because of it.
https://t.co/s973ZmhWdXI joined a bipartisan majority to oppose this bill because our country needs real immigration reform, not more partisan bills that don't even have a chance at passage. Let's pass one of the bipartisan bills we've already introduced.
https://t.co/4bSESvVSloIt overturns decades of precedent that ensured fair pay and safe work spaces, and creates uncertainty in the more than 20 states that have been handling fee agreements on their own. This is a blow to working families. We will keep fighting to strengthen protections.The Supreme Court #Janus ruling is a blatant, ideological attack on public servants, who have fought for rights that benefit all workers.I practiced law with Dana; we shared a legal secretary (the great @CajunWahine). He has top-notch intellect and integrity (&amp; excellent handwriting and likes to hunt fwiw). I’ve never seen him angry, but this opinion is not exactly mild-mannered. Judge, you’ve done SD proud! https://t.co/nEoy3bR1ZpWildfire season is here. Are you and your family prepared? Visit @ReadySanDiego to make a plan today. 
https://t.co/5gC75L7PqDIn San Diego, methane capture technology is turning a super pollutant into generated energy. I asked our @EnergyCommerce panelists, including @SempraEnergy, if there are sufficient market incentives to deploy this technology. ↓ https://t.co/6lrzaV4Lt3Everyone is guaranteed due process--whether they are a citizen or not. President Trump continues to abandon more and more American values each time he talks about immigration. This is not who we are. 
https://t.co/k6jt7F28fVThe disappointing Supreme Court travel ban ruling emboldens the President to pursue discriminatory policies. Congress must pass comprehensive immigration reform, which could serve as a constitutional check on the president’s authority.
https://t.co/jvUfad8SfLIn 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges ruled that marriage equality was the law of the land and that #loveislove. Today, we must continue the fight by passing the Equality Act to guarantee non-discrimination protections for LGBT Americans. #EqualityForward https://t.co/wiTqrdoE0aCongrats to @portofsandiego. We worked to get a $10 million TIGER grant to modernize the structure of the 10th Ave Marine Terminal. This new grant ensures they can also deploy a reliable, safe and resilient power source.
https://t.co/clxQ7mxqtPFurthermore, the ruling gives the president unprecedented power over immigration. As long as Congress delays passing real, comprehensive, immigration reform, this authority will remain unchecked. https://t.co/D5yxGVTveTIn March, I signed an amicus brief opposing the travel ban. Religious freedom is one of our core American values. Consistent with these values, our immigration laws don't regulate entry based on religious belief. #NoMuslimBanEver
https://t.co/aOedHCUkzNThis Supreme Court ruling undermines American values and slams the door on those fleeing violence and oppression. We don't have to choose between security and welcoming those seeking freedom and prosperity in America.
https://t.co/2RmFc6jc9zThreats to major U.S. industries are a threat to our economy and national security. Helped pass a bill to put @DHSgov in charge of protecting sectors central to our economy, like energy and water, from cyber-attacks. 
https://t.co/SBVtiQ7BXzHelped pass the Securing Public Areas of Transportation Facilities Act to develop policy suggestions to enhance security in public areas of transportation facilities.
https://t.co/29ehOIFVoMHelped pass the Enhancing Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative Act to direct @DHSgov to improve the ways they receive, manage, and act on tips that come from the public. An alert and informed public plays a critical role in keeping our nation safe.
https://t.co/q1n5DCAHp9I joined over 120 of my colleagues to demand answers from @DHSgov and @HHSGov on how they plan to reunite parents with their children. It's been 5 days since Trump's Executive Order and they still have no family reunification process. #KeepFamiliesTogether

Holder decision undid key provisions of the Voting Rights Act that helped the government identify voting jurisdictions with histories of racial discrimination.Every American should be able to execute their constitutional right to vote free from discrimination, intimidation, and disenfranchisement.San Diego's world-class technology is improving lives across the country every day. Proud to see @thermofisher lend their DNA technology to help reunite families separated at the border.
https://t.co/MCBzN70kuC@SteveKornacki stop calling it the “moderate” or “compromise” measure. It builds a massive wall, permits internment camps and has no bipartisan support. Its only a “compromise” between the right and far right.Check out our latest newsletter: Family Separation: Seriously Flawed and Destined to Fail
 https://t.co/9JdAR0Se5GWe can get a lot done when we work together. Today was a product of bipartisan cooperation. 

This is how Congress should work all the time. 
https://t.co/qvsswo7UbzWho knows if they even have enough votes for this mess next week. Either way, it’s a sad day for American government and values.The only way the Ryan bill could be seen as a compromise is if you consider it a compromise between the right wing and their far right wing. Of course, no Democrats had any input.
https://t.co/KzxInGrhQHThe Ryan bill and Goodlatte bill both end the diversity lottery, end forms of family-based immigration, and build the wall. They also permit the indefinite detention of families in violation of the law.
https://t.co/D2Vbjb666WThey wanted to cover 1.8 million Dreamers, but at most, the Ryan bill covers 1.4 million Dreamers and the @CatoInstitute says 82% of #DREAMers won’t be helped by it.
https://t.co/3XRw4iQu5MThose Republicans who wanted to help #DREAMers got played by their leadership. They gave up their leverage on the same promise that they would finally get a vote that @SpeakerRyan has been breaking for a year.While this was happening, our two-party solution to help #DREAMers fell apart this week because we were two Republicans short of forcing a vote on the #DreamAct and the bipartisan compromise #USAAct.
https://t.co/nvc84RQbehSo the Executive Order will be struck down and Trump will blame the courts, even though the law is clear. Meanwhile, Republican leaders in Congress have pulled the plug on bipartisan legislation that would pass with veto-proof margins and solve the problem.The Executive Order will permit indefinite detention of families with their children in internment camps, even though that’s illegal under existing law. The Flores case prohibits indefinite detention of minors, accompanied or not.
https://t.co/a5RKmTLdF8There is apparently no plan, nor ability, to reunite parents and kids that are now separated. Some parents have been deported without their children and it may be impossible to identify other children who are being held. The damage already done is deep and long lasting.The Trump Executive Order to stop separating kids from their parents is classic lipstick on a pig. Their border policy is still an immoral and un-American pig.I sent a letter with my colleagues asking @DHSgov and @HHSGov how they plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children that have been separated from their parents. This is one of many deep concerns we have with the White House's zero-tolerance policy and Executive Order. https://t.co/Qw6Hss7V5TLast year, I was honored to help pass the Forever G.I. Bill, which modernized veterans education benefits for the new economy. It also included my bill to make all Purple Heart veterans eligible for full education benefits, regardless of their length of active-duty service. https://t.co/KWNzY59hjnThe Montgomery GI Bill ensured Vietnam veterans could pursue an education. The Post-9/11 GI Bill expanded benefits for veterans on active duty on, or after, September 11 and allowed them to transfer unused educational benefits to their spouse or kids.In 1944, the G.I. Bill was created to help World War II veterans. The bill opened the door to higher education for many Americans who never had the opportunity. Since 1944, the bill has evolved to help even more veterans.Thanks @CMSGov! https://t.co/U7tnrFdYalAn analysis from the @CatoInstitute, a conservative think tank, found the majority of Dreamers won's benefit from the Republican immigration bills. Don't be fooled: These bills aren't a solution. They're bills to build the border wall. 
https://t.co/3XRw4iyTeeThe American Immigration Lawyers Association says family detention is "unacceptable, abrogates our international responsibilities to refugees, and goes against our country's most fundamental values."

They're right. #EndFamilyDetention https://t.co/sSdOSZhwQkA diversified energy portfolio helps address climate change and boost combat effectiveness. In @EnergyCommerce, I shared how our bill would help @ENERGY and @DeptofDefense work together to deploy advanced nuclear technology, a zero-emission energy source. https://t.co/yIXxfF2rzuThe far-right immigration bill failed, as expected. By allowing a vote on this bill, @SpeakerRyan just killed the discharge petition. 

We shouldn't be wasting our time voting on such partisan bills.

We should be promoting those values at home, and around the world.Immigrants and refugees are men, women and children, often fleeing danger and always seeking a better life, just like our ancestors. Today on #WorldRefugeeDay, I'm calling on President Trump to stop his cruel policy of detaining families seeking asylum indefinitely. https://t.co/XzbMiNE1mMI am deeply concerned about the conditions of detention facilities and how children are being treated.

Sadly, @SpeakerRyan is choosing to push highly partisan bills that have no chance of passage instead.

San Diego’s AAPI community has emulated that growth to become a political, economic, and social force in our city. This month, we celebrate those milestones. #AAPIHM https://t.co/NU3AWVkO8LI will keep fighting every day to get my Republican colleagues to act. We know there are Republicans who would join us on a vote to expand background checks-- If only @SpeakerRyan would allow it. #DoYourJobSaddened by yet, another school shooting in Noblesville, Indiana.

Congrats to Barbra of @ptlomahs, named the 2018 Classified Employee of the Year. https://t.co/FgF0ixTibHTrump is trying to claim his latest tariffs are a national security issue, but there's no evidence imported cars pose a threat. Instead, the plan will raise prices for our car industry, hurting our competitiveness and leaving buyers with fewer options.
https://t.co/BVvTNaJTQKThis week, I joined @HouseNewDems to unveil #AFuturethatWorks -- a plan to ensure Americans can succeed in a changing economy. https://t.co/wF5UTYLVZ1I sent a letter with my colleagues asking the Trump Administration to stop HHS from rolling back the #HealthCareRightsLaw, which protects patients from discrimination. Everyone has a right to access the care they need.  #PutPatientsFirst https://t.co/ar97UjHPGuHelped pass the defense spending bill for FY19 which continues the DOD's investment in San Diego and calls on the @USNavy to assess the national security implications of the Tijuana sewage spills.
https://t.co/atzw9MWHUp#TeamPeters joined @BalboaPark to celebrate their 150th anniversary.

It’s a small way we can show our appreciation for their service-- and send them a piece of home. https://t.co/1KsdlmEjVKI'm standing up for homeless students in San Diego.

Diversifying our energy will save money and lives.Today in @EnergyCommerce I spoke about the benefits of advanced nuclear energy. I'm working on a bill with @RepRichHudson that directs @DeptofDefense and @ENERGY to report on how military bases can employ advanced nuclear energy to increase resiliency. https://t.co/E5H4ePXXVsI sent a letter to @HHSGov with my @ProChoiceCaucus and Dem colleagues to oppose the "gag rule" that restricts #TitleX providers and access to quality, affordable, health care in communities across the country. https://t.co/x4vfN2vEtcAll women have the right to make their own health care choices and access the information and services they need. This latest move by the White House attacks this right and guts a program that serves those most in need. #ProtectTitleX
https://t.co/LyuzHoMNA7Our bill with @RepJackBergman to increase transparency and competition in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program passed the House. It ensures veterans have quality, affordable care by giving professionals the right supplies and devices. 
https://t.co/PchyT8Yow3This decision diminishes workers' ability to defend themselves against unsafe or unfair work environments. It would also prevent public outcry against these practices, which often leads to real change.
https://t.co/N6kuEb07j7Yes-- student loan repayment is a win/win. Students get to pay down their debt faster and employers get to recruit and maintain top talent. Our bill with @RodneyDavis incentives private employers to offer this program through a tax-free benefit. https://t.co/nkvN00J35UAnd we passed the Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act of 2017 to require the VA to report on services received by women veterans outside the VA to ensure they are receiving quality care. 
https://t.co/tnoNGkfhAAWe passed the SIT-REP Act to prevent schools for penalizing students using their GI bill benefits if the VA doesn't pay the school on time.
https://t.co/HK4FcJdBKFWe passed the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2018 to allow veterans with federal housing assistance to participate in job training and workforce reintegration.
https://t.co/eswlKRPSHgWe passed the Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act to connect VA health providers to a national network of drug monitoring programs, which will help identify patterns of opioid abuse among our veterans.
https://t.co/LnlxehC1zhToday, the House passed several bills from the Veteran's Affairs Committee. Our bipartisanship helps us get a lot done for our nation's heroes. Here's what the House was able to pass in one day:Since 1881, @RedCross has provided Americans with food, shelter, and emergency services in our greatest times of need. Thank you to @SDICRedCross for serving more than 3.6 million people in our region. https://t.co/wKSG2D9crpCongrats to @Scripps_Ocean on these research awards from @DeptofDefense that will advance studies of wave patterns and climate prediction. It also continues a partnership with @USNavy that dates back to WWII. https://t.co/Pc3xJ1D2tpThanks for your kind invitation and engaging participants. https://t.co/R3Cgtx7YOXOur hearts are with #SantaFe after yet another tragic school shooting. In 2018, there has been an average of one school shooting per week, but Republicans still refuse to expand background checks or work on other comprehensive solutions. Words are always too little, too late. https://t.co/6VSJNYM7YJThe @EnergyCommerce Committee passed our bill, the Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018, which would give patients greater access to innovative non-opioid alternatives for postoperative pain management.

To our #LGBTQ community in San Diego and across the county, we are with you today and every day.  #IDAHOT https://t.co/d09jo2NnMnOur military has led advances to address the growing threat of climate change. This new collaboration between @USNavy and @portofsandiego will ensure two pillars of our economy are resilient in the face of rising sea levels. 
https://t.co/L7k6ib0bmZ@TomTorlakson @sdschools Denying @sdschools this funding just because of a missing signature has nothing to do with the merit of the application. It doesn't just hurt students that are especially vulnerable-- It hurts all of us.I sent a letter to @TomTorlakson urging him to reevaluate @sdschools' application for a grant that will ensure homeless youth have access to transportation, school supplies, and other resources to help meet their basic needs so they can succeed in school. https://t.co/iplSYKpGaYThe #FarmBill used to be bipartisan. We should not be cutting food assistance. We should be investing more in algae, which is poised to revolutionize the way we look at fuel, manufactured products, and more. ↓
https://t.co/o4rQ8B5owVThese cuts mean San Diego families, seniors, veterans, and more may not be able to put food on the table. It abandons compassion for people who need help and threatens the livelihood of California's farmers when we should be supporting both.More than 260,000 people in San Diego County rely on CalFresh, federally known as the SNAP nutrition assistance program. The #FarmBill makes deep cuts to this program that helps families access healthy food when times are tough. https://t.co/5NhOcvjg2lVoted for the Justice Served Act of 2018 to provide funds to prosecute the rape kit backlog and get justice for sexual assault survivors.

These kind of investments support local jobs and open new doors to the global economy. #InfrastructureWeek https://t.co/aKgabgDomkToday in @EnergyCommerce, I asked @EPA Air and Radiation Assistant Administrator Wehrum if he thought greenhouse gases endanger the public health.

He said he "had a lot to learn." #CleanAirMonth https://t.co/K5cryTsqEjWe should be working towards a solution to the humanitarian crisis by bringing both sides back to the negotiating table and by refraining from policies that further inflame the conflict.The loss of life in Gaza is horrifying and a tragic culmination of months of tension and decades of conflict. 
https://t.co/ElkMxP7BeMIntroduced the Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act with @RepLarryBucshon to encourage the development of innovative non-opioid painkillers and ensure these new drugs are covered under Medicare, so seniors have more options for pain management.

Today, we remember the service and sacrifice of the brave soldiers who served during WWII. #VEDay https://t.co/KHCn8nIa0nBy walking away from the #IranDeal, Trump is making it easier for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. He is also undermining America's global leadership and testing long-standing alliances. It's a crippling blow to our credibility in world commerce, diplomacy, and force. https://t.co/LxJ75zrzQeAAPI Americans are already under counted in the census with one fifth of the population living in hard to count areas. The changes proposed by Trump would leave them even more underrepresented. #EveryoneCounts

We need to continue to support Flint families and we also need to update our water infrastructure to ensure our drinking supply is not at risk of another crisis. #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/YvB6jDTE4c@RepDanKildee During my career in environmental law, I learned many toxic exposures take years to have an effect, and children are most susceptible to toxins. They often suffer permanent damage because their defenses against these poisons are not yet fully developed.I visited Flint with @RepDanKildee and other Members of Congress in February 2016 to meet with residents and local business owners affected by the city’s ongoing water crisis. As a child of Michigan and former environmental  lawyer, I wanted to help. https://t.co/JWvpkDxhX1Four years later, Flint families are still using filters and bottled water, after elevated levels of lead were found in the city's tap water. The water crisis is an example of what can happen if we don't invest in water infrastructure. #DontForgetFlint
https://t.co/uzkOYZLkBDI worked to protect the Border Water Infrastructure Program from cuts, and yesterday @EPA announced a $1.17 million grant funded by that program to address the Tijuana River sewage spill.
https://t.co/HJ6YDzcJ8sMy office is able to help San Diego veterans and their families obtain records, retrieve medals, and get the benefits they earned though their service. Visit my website to learn more: https://t.co/y7LuwVoGmy https://t.co/7Gzp4oGH8uLt. Sauer made the ultimate sacrifice for his country.

https://t.co/HMYIacaraOMet with San Diego small business owners to hear how we can support them as they grow and create jobs in our region. I learned about each of their business and how @SDSBDCNetwork is helping them achieve their entrepreneurial goals. https://t.co/tlJG72K6UsDrilling along our coasts puts San Diego’s beautiful beaches, coastal communities, and businesses at risk. It also ignores the majority of Americans and scientific leaders who know drilling hurts our environment and our economy. #ProtectOurCoastThere have been over 25 oil spills in the United States alone since the #DeepwaterDisaster in 2010 and yet, Trump still wants to roll back regulations on wells and pipelines and open our coasts to offshore drilling.8 years ago, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill unleashed 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico causing the largest marine oil spill in history. We can't afford another devastating spill. #DeepwaterDisaster https://t.co/Qy5I60mV7EI hope this generation of Americans, who has grown up witnessing and experiencing these tragedies, can be the one to convince my Republican colleagues it's time to act. #Enough https://t.co/UCSzVV8InnFor almost two decades, we've witnessed tragedies across the country, but after each one, Congress has done nothing. I support commonsense safety measures like background checks, and banning bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and assault weapons.19 yrs ago, 13 people were killed during the #Columbine shooting, which was the deadliest high school shooting at the time. 11,100 lives have been lost in school shootings since then. How many more until Congress finds the courage to do something? #Enough

It's also another way our top genomics industry is helping save lives. 
https://t.co/L4sQsSUXQO@RepJeffDenham Republicans and Democrats agree-- it's time to pass a permanent, legislative fix for Dreamers. @RepJeffDenham's resolution will allow us to do so. #GiveUsAVote https://t.co/1RgDxBFq10I support @RepJeffDenham's resolution to force a debate on the bills that have been proposed because every day Congress fails to act, the future of our #Dreamers hangs in the balance. https://t.co/s5a4wSk85RThere is overwhelming support for a #DACA solution, but the House has not been allowed to vote on a single proposal. I have, and will continue, to work across the aisle to get a fix for #Dreamers.As the country mourns the passing of First Lady Barbra Bush, my thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family today. She will be remembered as an American matriarch, a champion of literacy, and a woman of grace and wit.
https://t.co/JI7fXlMmjLJoined @iaapa during their visit to DC to discuss how we can support amusement parks in San Diego and California. More than 35 million people visit San Diego each year and supporting these attractions helps fuel our thriving tourism industry. https://t.co/YCvJTJpTOuEvery veteran deserves the benefits they earned, regardless of uniform or when &amp; where they served. My bill would ensure career &amp; academic guidance offered by the @DeptVetAffairs is available to guardsmen &amp; reservists--just as it is to every other veteran.

This investment helps San Diego business grow and create jobs in our region. 
https://t.co/e3ilNQQjyGI’m ashamed and a little embarrassed by how out of touch our Supervisors are. This is so backward. But thanks to Greg Cox for (again) voting for what’s right.  https://t.co/TOLDKm6KphSan Diegans have an extra day to file and pay their taxes after the IRS has a system outage this morning. Visit the site below if you need extra time to file ↓

San Diegans have until April 17th to file, but if you can't meet the deadline, requesting an extension from @IRS is easy and will prevent late-filing penalties.

https://t.co/PJcxY95aM8 https://t.co/yfphpXuoAR1. Your wall is the opposite of everything San Diego stands for and San Diegans know it’s a waste of money that will do nothing to make us safer.
2. Congress has still not funded construction of your wall. It's a fence. https://t.co/Zkh7Ky1PjJThe U.S. hosts the largest number of international students worldwide. These students add to our economy and culture, while making the U.S. more competitive in the global economy. #YouAreWelcomeHere
https://t.co/qb6XXUZS5BWhat we really need is a long-term budget that invests in programs that will help grow the economy. If we don't, we sacrifice flexibility, jobs, and opportunity for families and businesses. #FixTheDebtIt’s astonishing that ‘the party of fiscal responsibility’ is pushing this proposal when debt is on track to overtake the size of our economy by 2028 and Congress has no plans to pass a budget this year.The budget amendment proposed by Republicans is nothing more than a gimmick to compensate for irresponsible spending-- It actually will prevent Congress from funding certain programs, especially in an emergency.
https://t.co/Y4CxRXHB4FSince 2015, security forces in Ethiopia have killed nearly 1,000 people and detained tens of thousands more.

https://t.co/eavpyR32cDWhat questions would you ask #Zuckerberg? Reply and share your views with me.I asked #Zuckerberg if Congress should define the legal duty private companies have to their customers, with respect to personal information, and whether financial penalties would make these protections a priority ↓ https://t.co/6T3v5knVDmAmericans deserve answers from Facebook and better protection of their personal data.
