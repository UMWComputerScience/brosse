Korean War POWs aren’t getting the back pay they earned for their service. I’m fighting to right this historic wrong by pushing for the passage of my bill – the Never Forgotten Korean War POW Act. Details: https://t.co/BF7YZHpHWS https://t.co/Oa0BVzCoSqToday is the last day of #PrideMonth – but that doesn’t mean we stop celebrating! I’m proud to be fighting for my #LGBTQ family in Congress. It’s past time for full equality – and I won’t stop pushing until that happens. https://t.co/1w7AguigUh#PTSD is serious and we should be doing more to stop it. It’s up to everyone to stay vigilant and recognize the signs of PTSD. If you know a vet that’s struggling, call 1-800-273-8255. https://t.co/s1hYcGloa9ICYMI: House Administration claimed I was lying about their discriminatory policy barring the use of funds to buy tampons. Watch me read the email we received and decide for yourself: https://t.co/fo1guAeXzF40,000: That’s the estimated number of homeless veterans in our country right now. It’s just not right and I’m working in Congress on legislation that would help get these vets off the street and back into society. https://t.co/v9pP8DMKlSUPDATE: earlier this wk, my office got an email saying that we couldn't use our funds to buy tampons (even though we have female constituents and staff). When we called out the committee that makes the rules, they denied the rule exists in the first place. They're full of it. https://t.co/IyZ8aHf0dYThis bill was not a compromise. It still holds #DREAMers hostage, slashes legal immigration, and limits access to asylum for innocent people fleeing persecution – all while throwing billions of dollars down the drain for Trump’s border wall. I voted no. https://t.co/0BiMuffm0VThis decision is a major blow to workers and families. Especially in New York State. Public service workers need the strength of unions to rally for their rights and fight back against attacks on fair benefits and working conditions. https://t.co/VHcDLXUsQcThey rounded up a guy with leukemia and a pregnant woman and slammed people to the ground. The #TrumpAdministration is out of control and using inhumane tactics on people - many of whom are here legally. This has to stop. It's not who we are. https://t.co/gVprRITju1Things you can buy with Congressional funds: 
✅”executive tissue holders” 
✅embellished letter openers
✅brass bookends 
❌tampons 
https://t.co/BBspFkOMrxMy office bought tampons for female visitors and our staff. Then we got an email from @HouseAdmnGOP telling us we couldn’t use funds to purchase a necessary hygiene product. That’s ridiculous. More info: https://t.co/8jyX3O4PeSThis morning I was on @MSNBC discussing #JusticeKennedy's retirement and what it means for #marriageequality, the #righttochoose, affirmative action, and more. Watch here: https://t.co/VMVkoa1lGiGoing live with @AliVelshi and @SRuhle to discuss Anthony Kennedy’s retirement from #SCOTUS. Tune in to @msnbc! https://t.co/fuCO5yP6UX2/2 Proud to do my part in advancing this bill that would help get vets the care they need. https://t.co/jzKsYHyL0b1/2 Currently only some Vietnam War vets are extended disability benefits for exposure to #agentorange. That’s ridiculous — if you served our country and were affected, then you deserve access to treatment.The same bill that sucked in May still sucks in June. It would still eliminate the largest conservation program in the country, cut crop insurance by millions, and do far too little for #NewYork farmers. I voted against it. https://t.co/aSUpgarQahGot the chance to catch up with a group of kids from the New York Migrant Education Program today! They asked great questions about #familyseparations, #gunviolence and #immigration. https://t.co/AsmLwS14ORThis is bad news for all public service workers. These people literally keep our country running &amp; we should be doing everything in our power to protect them. This is a war on labor &amp; working families – we have to stop it. https://t.co/3KaAzxE1eiThis bill makes sure that the 90,000 Vietnam Navy vets exposed to #AgentOrange get their disability benefits. It’s commonsense – and I was proud to vote for it.  Now we need the Senate to step up and get this passed into law. https://t.co/ZhyI7ywuFvThe Republican-controlled @FCC killed #NetNeutrality, but the fight for our free, open, and accessible internet is not over. The Senate has already voted to save net neutrality – and I’m proud to be doing my part by supporting similar legislation in the House. https://t.co/bZnKsR9AAHThe freedom to practice your religion without interference is democracy 101 – #SCOTUS made a bad call in allowing the #TrumpAdministration to discriminate against people based on their religion. That’s not what America is all about. https://t.co/csJUGPwqSEThe 2,300 kids separated from their parents at the border need action. #DREAMers need action. We need to get something done on immigration – no more back-and-forth. Real lives are in limbo.  https://t.co/SpEgcR8q7hMartin Martinez was a good American. He paid his taxes, took care of his wife, and raised his two kids right. He died two months ago after being deported by the #TrumpAdministration. I’ll never stop fighting for immigrants like Martin. He deserved a hell of a lot better. https://t.co/YA0OZKvrdzLast week a young woman with Down Syndrome was separated from her family at the southern border – and the #TrumpAdministration did nothing to stop it. That's insane. And I'm working on new legislation to ensure it doesn't happen again. https://t.co/uNHP3mAivcI tried to visit an @HHSGov facility housing children separated from their families at the border this weekend – but the #TrumpAdministration stonewalled me. We don’t have any time to waste – these kids need to be reunited with their folks right now. https://t.co/8kAbAXzYRZWe need a new vision for getting people back to work. Through this strategic partnership between the @US_EDA &amp; Hudson Valley Regional Council, we can leverage private investments and boost our economy. It’s a win-win &amp; I was proud to help make it happen. https://t.co/M48gzsHVy3Joined my colleagues yesterday to attempt to get access to a facility holding immigrant children separated from their families at the border - but the #TrumpAdministration stonewalled us. These kids need to reunited with their folks — now. https://t.co/NK1mw7wRoRCongratulations to Devani Rochelle Roberts from the #HudsonValley on being selected out of hundreds of applicants to attend the 2018 Women in Science Girls STEAM camp! https://t.co/WsBOORefbD2/2 even though we have a constitutional responsibility to keep an eye on them. We’re also announcing new legislation to get these innocent children back with their parents immediately.1/2 I joined my colleagues in Westchester today to try to get into a facility holding immigrant children who have been separated from their families. #TrumpAdministration officials have enacted a new policy delaying entry to lawmakers – https://t.co/5HtPxcnL36It’s been 74 years since the #GIbill was signed into law. As the son of a Navy vet who went to school on the GI Bill, I know firsthand how it made a college education possible for millions of vets &amp; their families. Today we are reminded that where much is given, much is owed. https://t.co/cdwuMQKeCl2/2 We’re just asking the @USCG to do things in a more transparent way this time around – clearly this means a lot to us, and they need to take that into account before they propose adding even a single new anchorage site.1/2 The #HudsonValley killed the first anchorage proposal together – ten thousand citizens, committed local groups, and elected officials on both sides of the aisle – but this thing could come back – and if it does, we want to be ready.  https://t.co/6WGX1MzW942/2 At every board meeting, I heard him state his core belief that ‘when you fail at character, you fail at leadership.’ Bob Caslen succeeded at both.1/2 Superintendent Caslen is an exemplary officer and has been one of the best Superintendents in the history of @WestPoint_USMA. He will be missed by the faculty, cadets, and the rest of the West Point Community.  https://t.co/OYSLlsFnpFThis is insane. There’s no more time to waste. Over 2,000 kids are still separated from their parents. They need to be back with their families. Now.  https://t.co/djUblHRLl9They did nothing – nothing – to improve this bill for #HudsonValley farmers. I voted no. Again. The same bill that sucked in May still sucks in June. https://t.co/vVb8G5zIRIMartin was a good citizen who paid his taxes, took care of his family, and raised his kids right. He died a few months ago – and I think he deserved a hell of a lot more from the country he loved. https://t.co/TigwIPe9s1Step one: start fire 
Step two: put out part of fire 
Step three: claim credit 
https://t.co/zhcbA2do3hThis fight is not over yet. We have to get these kids back with their parents ASAP. https://t.co/TV2wNVRZbdFour years ago today, I married the man who fills my life with love, laughter, and family. It took 22 years together before we could be legally married, but that day was the happiest of my life. I love you, Randy – happy anniversary. https://t.co/tYnmK7XO4RI just got off the House floor, where I honored the life of Martin Martinez: a dad and undocumented immigrant who worked hard in our country for 30 years. Martin died a few months ago – and I think he deserved a lot more from the country he loved. https://t.co/QXSUSTtc2tThis is insane. These kids are four and five years-old. They were brought to our borders through no fault of their own. #POTUS could pick up the phone right now and end this. But he won’t. How much longer are you going to hold these kids for ransom, #POTUS?https://t.co/mGK07qgJhI2/2 Today we should take a moment to not only honor the tireless work of those who fought to abolish slavery, but also recognize those that continue to fight for greater equality and opportunity for all. https://t.co/j9fyBAGVaU1/2 Every year, I’m proud to celebrate #Junteenth, which commemorates the freeing of the last African-American slaves in our country.#POTUS could do this on his own, but because he wants to pretend otherwise, we're introducing legislation to make it clear: you can't separate children from their families at the border. https://t.co/dvw8aVPCQMThis is just terrible. So glad the first responders were there and were able to act quickly and safely evacuate the people trapped inside. https://t.co/lu7HDevZBxProud that my bill – the Stop Online Opioid Sales Act – passed the House on Friday! This bill will do what it says: work to eliminate the online sale of drugs that are ripping communities like ours apart. https://t.co/rd4hW4e5KJWe’ll need strong regulations on age, a plan to tax it, and smart implementation, but this would be a good move that would help grow our economy, create new jobs, and expand sectors – like agriculture – across New York. https://t.co/LjXCg2jDX4.@laurawbush is right on target. This is out of control – babies are being ripped from their parents’ arms and thrown into facilities where they can’t even be comforted. It’s inhumane and it’s un-American. https://t.co/M8ufxPk612Don’t let the bureaucracy stand in your way – call my Newburgh office and we’ll fight with you. It’s what we’re literally paid to do and we’ve helped thousands of HV folks already do so. https://t.co/JiuN6I5uUjToo many vets are living on the street. That has got to change – these men &amp; women risked their lives to defend our freedoms &amp; we have an obligation to look out for them once they come home. It’s that simple. That’s why I’m proud to co-sponsor the Homeless Veterans Families Act. https://t.co/JmceLcUUVqHappy #FathersDay to my fellow dads in the #HudsonValley! https://t.co/0BSrJ1s16TThanks to my summer interns for all of your hard work!

I’m proud that he’ll finally be laid to rest at @WestPoint_USMA https://t.co/4rV7cuPvXoWhat the hell is going on in America? Children are being put in cages, babies are being ripped from their mothers’ arms. It’s insane. And it’s un-American. This week I joined my colleagues in Congress in formally condemning this president’s administration. https://t.co/zIKnxHEIdEJust passed my 3rd bill through the House in three weeks! The Stop Online Opioid Sales Act would do just what it sounds like – make our communities safer by fighting the flow of drugs online. https://t.co/RpvX43m1y4Warmest wishes to my Muslim neighbors in the #HudsonValley and throughout the country who are celebrating the end of #Ramadan this evening. #EidMubarak! https://t.co/Ub4zuCk5VsHappy #FlagDay!

If you would like a flag flown over the Capitol please check out my website: https://t.co/tA9oW7fASuThe #opioidepidemic is tearing communities apart. I hear about it everywhere I go in the HV. I’m fighting to combat this crisis, including introducing the Stop Online Sales of Opioids Act – which I’m working to pass through the House this week. Details: https://t.co/zXMAUw7B9dHappy birthday to the @USArmy! Thanks for 243 years of keeping America safe. https://t.co/qo4k9eRYHSYou used to be able to raise a family on one salary – it’s not so easy these days. Middle class families need a break when it comes to the high costs of child care. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor the Child Care for Working Families Act. https://t.co/E7oBT8Oe1GIt was an honor to nominate these 11 Hudson Valley students for U.S. service academies. These young men and women represent the best and the brightest our community has to offer – can’t wait to see how far they go! https://t.co/bNWgClEjh3I’ve said it time and time again: if a responsible immigration package came to the floor of the House, it would pass. That’s not what we’re seeing here unfortunately. I’m monitoring this situation – and these pieces of legislation – like a hawk. https://t.co/kJ24Zs7wby2/2 That stops now. I’ve compiled a helpful guide of resources vets in crisis can use. It’s free and confidential – so don’t be afraid to reach out. https://t.co/EJCzl0EPt41/2 Our service members sacrifice their lives to protect our freedoms – and it’s our duty to look out for them once they return home. The sad reality is that too many vets are in crisis in this country and too many more don’t know where to turn for help.Proud to sign onto @repjoecrowley's Opioid Workforce Act – which would create 1,000 new #Medicare-supported medical residency positions to help address the #OpioidEpidemic and #PhysicianShortage!2/2 enforceable agreement that holds #NorthKorea to their word without giving away the farm. I’ll believe it when I see it, but #POTUS does deserve credit for backing off his inflammatory rhetoric &amp; initiating this meeting. Diplomacy is rarely a bad thing. https://t.co/PFreKgOR191/2 The #TrumpKimSummit was a step in the right direction, but I do have some concerns about suspending our defensive exercises with our ally, #SouthKorea, because we got a nice photo op and a promise from Kim. Any final deal should be a real,2/2 But it’s important to remember that the #LGBTQ community is bigger than hate, it’s bigger than violence, and when we set our mind to something, we get stuff done. The #PulseShooting was a great tragedy, but it got us in the game on gun safety.1/2 #PrideMonth is supposed to be a time when our community can celebrate who we are and how far we’ve come – not worry about being the victims of #gunviolence. My heart is with everyone still hurting from the shooting. https://t.co/iHTPAH0REW2/ America’s facing constantly emerging threats and new challenges to the established world order – we need committed new leaders who can rise to the challenge – I think our appointees are the best people for the job.1/ Proud of the 11 #HudsonValley students who received appointments to our nation’s military academies! I’m incredibly proud of all of the young people who submitted their applications and it was my honor to nominate these students. https://t.co/wZMKCjX2lVOne blood donation can save up to three lives.

Now, the House needs to step up and do the same. https://t.co/65MeOGLrWYIt’s been 55 years since the #EqualPayAct was signed into law. There’s no denying it – it's helped close the pay gap between men &amp; women. But we’re kidding ourselves if we think the fight is over. I remain committed to closing the #paygap &amp; ensuring equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/JOnVN0Eco8Happy Pride, Hudson Valley! I’m a proud member of the #LGBTQ family and I’m fighting like hell against the Trump Administration and conservatives in Congress that are working to strip away our rights. https://t.co/zDkkzSCHM9#PTSD is hurting veterans and service members all over the country. During #PTSDawarenessmonth, I want those vets to know: I see you. You are not alone. If you – or a vet you know – are struggling, call 1-800-273-8255. https://t.co/bTnbsZCzml2/ I passed my second bill in two weeks through the House on Wednesday – and it would help us combat this problem. https://t.co/PmHKvdhyhW1/ Dam safety may not sound like the most exciting subject, but that perception would change in a hurry if one of our dams in the #HudsonValley failed during a storm and folks lost their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives.Got the chance to speak at the Victory Institute’s annual #LGBTQ Pride Month reception in Washington! The @victoryinstitut is working day in and day out fighting for progress for the LGBTQ community – I’m proud to stand with them in that fight. https://t.co/KcEtcUmMuaNearly 40,000 American veterans are homeless &amp; over a million more are at risk of becoming homeless. One homeless vet is one too many. I’m fighting hard for our vets in Congress and I’ll keep working to pass legislation that gets them off the streets and into affordable housing. https://t.co/ATnvTFu6arI’ve been getting a ton of emails from folks concerned about the children being separated from their parents at the U.S. border. What’s been going on is inhumane, cruel, and traumatic. Congress must step up and take action. https://t.co/Em9ThCMpWwIf a reasonable immigration reform bill came to the floor today, it would pass. Unfortunately, the #GOP won’t let it happen. We’ve got kids being ripped from their parents at the border &amp; 700,000 #DREAMers’ lives in limbo. It's time for action. Stay tuned. https://t.co/CYHZaBKFQvOn #DDay74, we pause to remember the tens of thousands of Americans who bravely stormed the shore and fought with our allies. These men and women made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms and help change the course of history – they will never be forgotten. https://t.co/87dgKkfZjCIt’s been 50 years since the assassination of #BobbyKennedy – a true crusader for justice and equality. We’ve got to honor his memory by continuing to champion the causes he fought so hard for. RIP, Bobby. https://t.co/KUwsieFPYDRecently I got my bill, the Know Your Vets Act – passed through the House. This legislation will help service members transition back to civilian life. It’s good news for our vets – but don’t take my word for it. Here’s Stephanie Keegan, mother of an HV vet, praising this bill: https://t.co/gUJAwwVc9GCongrats to Jonathan from Chester Academy on advancing to the next round of the @ApolloTheater's "Stars of Tomorrow" youth talent competition!

That means investing in #CTE and the resources needed for next-generation jobs. This morning I talked with @SRuhle about my approach: https://t.co/Bm1WcGNdgrCongratulations to Lisa Gomez from Beacon on being accepted to the Library of Congress' prestigious Junior Fellows Program! https://t.co/WME17jiRthAlthough this #SCOTUS decision doesn’t give businesses the right to discriminate universally, it’s still an indication we need the #EqualityAct. If the courts won’t act to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans, Congress should. https://t.co/4b9QCcZtbE2/ Those same protections should apply to Americans based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.
 #MasterpieceCakeshop1/ I led the brief in Congress in defense of this couple. This is disappointing – there’s no denying it. We wouldn’t let a hotel owner refuse a room to a person because of their race or allow a restaurant to deny service to a couple based on their religion https://t.co/awDtcts5nGAbout to go live with @SRuhle on @MSNBC. We'll be discussing trade and the Mueller investigation — tune in! https://t.co/fmsey7Iw7VThis week marked 1 year since #potus pulled our country out of the #ParisClimateAgreement.

It’s unacceptable. https://t.co/0qaaUYMSTBMy dad was a navy vet and these issues are personal for me. We have an obligation to help those that served our country and defended our freedoms.

These issues are personal for me and my family, and I’m proud to be fighting for the #LGBTQ+ community in Congress. https://t.co/bmCpMOQhDm2/ Here’s where I stand: I support legislation to ban assault weapons, raise the purchasing age, improve the NICS system, implement universal background checks and close the gun show loophole, and allow the @CDCgov to research gun violence.1/ It’s #gunviolenceawarenessday and it’s long past time leaders in Congress step up, take action, and combat this problem head on. https://t.co/rRPo5ciOeXThis is well-deserved – John is out there every day looking out for the #HudsonRiver and protecting our environment. Thank you for the work you do and congrats, John! https://t.co/pAuKwqUwAl2/ This is something we need to be taking seriously and we have to make responsible investments in the Dam Safety Program to do that. I’m pushing in Congress to make that happen. https://t.co/LVcSIU2mT11/ People don’t realize how important dam safety is until one fails and destroys the surrounding communities, floods farmlands and people lose their lives. Right here in the #HudsonValley we saw dams at real risk of failure during recent storms.June is #PTSDAwarenessMonth. Our vets &amp; service members  sacrificed to protect our country. Now, it's our turn to pay attention,  recognize the signs of PTSD &amp; TBI &amp; offer help. If you - or a vet you know - are struggling with one of these unseen illness, call 1-800-273-8255. https://t.co/UbzqEnmIFzFrom my family to yours: happy #PrideMonth! https://t.co/YHX7DBZrodIn DECEMBER, Puerto Rico Governor @PRrossello asked @fema for housing assistance after #HurricaneMaria – 5 months later they finally got back to him and denied the request.

I’m leading the effort in Congress to unlock the federal funds needed for this rebuilding. https://t.co/8yb9v3Kl0hDuring #MilitaryAppreciationMonth, we should all remember to thank those who are serving.

We need the Postal Service to get in the game on this and make sure we stop it. https://t.co/Pzug89CFFJ2/ It’s not enough to mislead the taxpayers, now they’re willing to withhold critical health information for personal &amp; political reasons – it’s completely unacceptable.1/ I don’t give a damn about the @EPA administrator’s public relations concerns here, I’ve got people at home wondering whether they need to be worried about the #PFOS in their blood. https://t.co/1Ou8PhXZwd2/ I’m proud to announce that bipartisan legislation I introduced with @RepGallagher to bridge that gap just passed through the House of Representatives. https://t.co/7XPdGA95hJ1/ If you’re active duty and you’re dealing with #PTSD or substance abuse, you’ve got resources through the @DeptofDefense to help you – and you’ve also got resources at the @DeptVetAffairs when you transition out of the military – but there’s a gap between the two.2/ I’m disappointed we’re back to square one. We’ve got to keep working toward a real solution for full denuclearization.1/ I know a lot of folks will cheer this news, but it’s not just #POTUS that loses – we all do. This meeting was a real opportunity for peace on the Korean Peninsula &amp; the region. https://t.co/MhJLk6keJVOur #servicemembers need a raise.

If you need help, give my Newburgh office a call at (845) 561-1259.  https://t.co/g6IraNewGe#ICYMI: I made a final attempt to fix the partisan #FarmBill that failed in the House last week. The same week we got hit with a deadly storm, Washington Republicans proposed cutting billions of dollars from the very program our farmers will rely on to get back on their feet. https://t.co/b6v0VcDPr4No one should have to face the bureaucracy alone – and my offices are here to help.

One homeless vet is one too many. Congress must take action on my bill that would rehab "zombie" homes &amp;  turn them into housing for our vets. It's a commonsense, bipartisan bill &amp; I’m fighting to get it passed. https://t.co/fPdO7Bj6eYCaught up with some Newburgh firefighters this morning after the storms. These guys have been out there day and night responding to emergencies. Got the chance to share a meal with them and learn more about the storm response on the ground. https://t.co/0jMUtTEpicIt’s #ArmedForcesDay – where we celebrate the brave men and women who have served and sacrificed to protect our country. I’m proud to represent and fight for over 40,000 #HudsonValley #veterans and @WestPoint_USMA  in Congress.I’m glad that the Senate did the right thing and voted to protect #netneutrality. Now, the House needs to step up and do the same. I’m fighting to save net neutrality in Congress, because I think we should keep our internet the way it’s always been: open &amp; full of innovation. https://t.co/4q4XL9CyhdMay is #MilitaryAppreciationMonth, but if you ask me, 1 month isn’t long enough. We owe our vets &amp; service members a debt of gratitude &amp; I’m proud to have passed 8 bills into law to support them. I’ve also helped over 1,000 vets cut through red tape to get their earned benefits. https://t.co/uJzjYoBkXTI’m on the ground in Newburgh talking with folks affected by this week’s storms and helping serve hot meals.

This is another attack on health care and on women. I’ll do everything I can to stop it. https://t.co/a3Utm8YjgBThe #GOPFarmBill was bad news for #HudsonValley farmers – it would have cut billions in crop insurance funding, conservation programs, and it didn’t do enough for specialty crop growers like the ones we have in the HV. I voted against it. https://t.co/fQ7kxcQo9lThe power is back on at my Newburgh office – if you need help, please give us a call at (845) 561-1259.This is just devastating and it marks the 22nd #schoolshooting we’ve seen this year – and the 3rd this week alone.

Making our trains safer has been on the to-do list for far too long and Metro-North should be working full steam ahead to install PTC by its deadline at the end of the year. I’m watching this situation like a hawk. https://t.co/hUT7bdPCIYIt’s #NationalNursesWeek!

We can’t thank our nurses enough &amp; I want to thank them for the important work they do. https://t.co/FcqdJgRsraSupporting the arts is a great example of where we can do a lot of good with a small investment.

I’m not going to go along with cutting kids’ health insurance to cover for their fiscal irresponsibility.1/ I get it – they blew up the budget by giving tax cuts to the richest of the rich and then spending like they’d hit the lottery. Now they’re trying to crawl back to their base and apologize for running up trillion dollar deficits. https://t.co/I0P0q6qykgThe GOP #farmbill would cut #SNAP benefits by $23 billion compared to the 2014 version of the bill. That means millions of people who need a hand up will be forced to go without. That’s why I’m fighting to save it. https://t.co/4FjyYioZ6DI'd like to thank teachers across the #HudsonValley for their dedication and passion for educating our kids. Teaching can be a thankless job – but it’s one of the most important in our society. I you haven’t already – thank a teacher today! #TeacherAppreciationDay4/ If we scrap the deal, abandon our @NATO allies &amp; the Iranians start racing toward a #nuclearweapon, we could easily find ourselves in another ground war in the #MiddleEast. I’d feel better if I knew what #POTUS' plan was for that scenario. I don’t think he’s thought about it.3/ Sure, the #IranDeal is not perfect – I’ve said that since it was brokered – but you don’t have to end the deal to strengthen it.2/ All the evidence we have indicates that it has. And the proof’s in the pudding – three years ago they were mere months away from having a #nuclearweapon and today they have no nuclear weapons capacity.1/ #Iran is a real danger to the U.S. and to the region and we must never let them get their hands on nuclear weapons. My only priority when looking at this deal is whether or not it keeps America and our allies safe from a nuclear-armed Iran. https://t.co/oY7zbhDxvrI’ve been getting a ton of calls from folks asking about #animalabuse prevention efforts in Congress.

I hear about how important this program is all the time. We just can’t cut it.My dad went to school on the GI bill and sent five kids to school on one salary – that’s near impossible for most folks today. And yet, House Republicans are proposing slashing #student federal aid by $15 BILLION – with a capital “B.” https://t.co/GK3Bk0xMlN5/ Randy and I wish Bill, his wonderful wife Pat, and their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren all the best in this world.4/ Because of his decency and warmth, we became true friends and partners in serving our neighbors. I’ll always be proud of that partnership. Senator Larkin has made an impact on every community he represents and his legacy will last for a century.3/ Senator Larkin is a noble statesman and a happy warrior. “Public servants like Bill Larkin shine brightly and light the way for cooperation and friendship even in an era when those essential values are vanishing.2/ Bill Larkin is one of the most honorable people I’ve ever met. He’s dedicated his entire adult life to the service of others – from the tropical islands of the South Pacific and snow-capped mountains of Korea – to the halls of the state capitol in Albany.My statement on retirement of Senator Bill Larkin: 

1/ If you’re truly lucky, in the course of a public career you meet a few precious people who make the journey more joyful, more fun. Sometimes they are not a member of your own generation or even in your own political party.Washington Republicans’ #taxbill is making health care more expensive. Don’t take my word for it, the president’s former @HHSGov Secretary Tom Price has even admitted it. We need to go after the cost of care in addition to expanding coverage. https://t.co/AB7crnUg86D.C. Republicans’ attempts to slash funding for the #gateway should anger anybody who cares about economic growth &amp; creating good-paying jobs. Our local &amp; national economies need this project. https://t.co/60OZVZb3PXI’ve said it since the beginning: the #GOPTaxBill had a lot more to do with helping the big guys at the top than your average American worker. Don’t take my word for it - just ask Senator Rubio, who voted for it. https://t.co/5QlDToL6DjProud to stand with Mr. Mellin yesterday to announce new legislation to ensure folks like him — who were POWs during the #KoreanWar — finally get the payment they are owed by the government.

Proud to announce that a provision of mine to investigate this situation passed the House today – https://t.co/G5Eyik3EZGWe had thousands of Americans who went without the help they needed because these guys had no idea what they were doing &amp; apparently it’s the wild west at @FEMA.

Putnam is 1 of only 2 counties in the country working to innovate new ways of looking out for kids during disasters – &amp; it was great to hear more about their work.Proud to join the Putnam County Department of Health &amp; Community Resilience Coalition in Washington to talk about their work creating a model for child-focused disaster resilience planning. https://t.co/6E5OzjPjbMPaul dedicated more than half his life serving the city of #Newburgh and its people as a #policeofficer – my thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time. https://t.co/eZNxHRuzf5#PuertoRico is facing another blackout - seven months after #HurricaneMaria.

He sprang into action to literally save a stranger’s life. I carry #Narcan with me in my car everywhere I go - and I encourage you do the same. It’s easy – and you could save a life. https://t.co/yec373trM5I hope all of America will join me in saying a prayer for Mrs. Bush, the former president, and the rest of the Bush family as they struggle with their loss.I wish I was half the parent, spouse &amp; political strategist Barbara Bush was. She reminds us of a time when strong, principled people governed our country with civility, humility &amp; grace. Especially now – we should remember her by working to return those values to public life.Proud to be introducing this bill to ensure that folks in affordable housing units aren’t thrown out on the streets after an emergency – great write up by @wu_PoJo. https://t.co/vDwV0ZpN6oHonored Assemblyman Frank Skartados and Newburgh Mayor Judy Kennedy in a speech today on the House floor.

Don’t take my word for it – it’s in the @USCBO report.  https://t.co/nkOlG0JWQFNow that the dust has settled with the #GOPTaxPlan, we’re finding out just how bad it is. Turns out, the bill will send jobs overseas and encourage big corporations to stash their earnings in foreign countries. https://t.co/3BxZsCWokNGot the chance to treat my spring semester interns to lunch today!

Jean’s intellect &amp; decency sparkled in this life and she will be missed.Jean was a personal friend &amp; neighbor – she danced at my wedding &amp; baked cookies with my kids. She was a passionate voice for education and a stalwart booster of the Haldane School District. This is a tragic loss for the Cold Spring community.Jean Marzollo was a #HudsonValley treasure who brought education &amp; wonder to millions of children &amp; parents. I remember enjoying her work – especially the I Spy series – with my own children. https://t.co/iBvdP6B8r5Got the chance to catch up with a bunch of kids from @Haldane_Minds in Washington! These kids are our future and I’m proud to be working in Congress to support our public schools, make college more affordable, and invest in the trades and skilled labor education. https://t.co/LUDehjy8rL(2/2) His retirement should also be a wakeup call to the #GOP – the American people have had it with backroom dealing &amp; a partisan refusal to compromise. I hope that in his final days as Speaker, #PaulRyan seeks out common ground &amp; a transparent approach to wielding the gavel.(1/2) Although @SpeakerRyan &amp; I don’t share the same political philosophy, I believe he’s a good man and I appreciate his service to his constituents and the country. I wish him and his family the best as they transition away from public life. https://t.co/41sxF8BRDoI’ll go to bat for the City like I always have – now we need them to do their part.Now, the City Council should agree to accept the grant and contribute their fair share of funding if the federal government makes another investment. In the meantime, they should invest the money the County provided in retaining as many positions as possible.I’m glad the City Council has taken the first step toward protecting the people of Newburgh and saving these firefighters’ jobs – as elected officials our primary responsibility should be to keep our people safe.  https://t.co/oSGyk95rNSClosing the #PayGap is an important part of my agenda for expanding economic opportunities for women. More here – https://t.co/eAn5LdUYZ8People should be paid based on the quality of their work, not their gender. Today is #EqualPayDay – the symbolic day when women’s average earnings catch up to their white male counterparts’ earnings from last year. https://t.co/5MdgRqf5MoAll vets should get the opportunity to visit the memorials that celebrate their service. Shout out to @HVHonorFlight for making this possible. If you have time this weekend, think about heading to Stewart to see the #veterans off. https://t.co/3sMM6Y0QRYThis is just terrible. Too many families in the HV have had to face this disease alone. We need to invest in Lyme research &amp; prevention. I’ve worked to pass two pieces of legislation to get that done – and there’s more work to do. https://t.co/crUUCOVbTUI’ve been getting a lot of complaints from folks in the #HudsonValley about delayed mail delivery from the @USPS, and I called on them to take action and up their game – https://t.co/EMmsuFi8sWWe’ve already gotten several submissions for the Congressional Art Competition- there's still time for students to send in their work.

I’m working to get something done about outrageous tuition costs. https://t.co/8Fha5todyM(2/2)  Resource challenges and a changing market obviously make it tough for USPS to keep up, but older Americans waiting on medication and folks waiting for important paperwork don’t have the luxury of dealing with long delays. https://t.co/uQkHqr3bZ7(1/2) Americans have come to expect fast and dependable mail delivery because @USPS has always done such a great job, but I’m getting a lot of complaints, and we need to make sure the Post Office is maintaining its high standards.The community and elected officials put pressure on the utility companies during last month’s outages and it worked – https://t.co/4r3acrr8tA.@Interior is soon expected to launch a lease sale for destructive oil and gas drilling in the #ArcticRefuge. We need to #ProtectTheArctic for future generations, not auction it off to the highest bidders from the oil and gas industry.Couldn’t agree more.
