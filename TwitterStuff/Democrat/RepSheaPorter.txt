Under no circumstances should the Senate confirm a new justice until the American people make their voices heard on Election Day, which is just four months away. 

My full statement on recent #SCOTUS decisions: https://t.co/sAAm5iBXlTI was lucky to know Wayne Alterisio and honored to call him my friend. Wayne was a tireless advocate for the working men and women of NH. A friend to labor and to all of humanity, Wayne cared about people and making lives better. I am keeping his family in my thoughts &amp; prayers. https://t.co/f7uU6rzsFJThe #SCOTUS Wayfair decision is unfair to our state and will harm NH businesses. Other states shouldn’t be able to force Granite State business owners to navigate a complicated web of tax collection rules in order to collect and remit taxes that we don’t even have in our state.Happy 230th Birthday New Hampshire! On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire ratified the Constitution. As the ninth state to do so, we officially made this brilliant document the law of the land. https://t.co/pWXPjgtXqzIt’s about time. It was outrageous, and a violation of the trust we place in our public officials, that for months, the administration held back publication of this report. https://t.co/LdBmcLkg2xThis is good news. Pure maple syrup should not have an “added sugar” label. On June 8, I asked FDA to exempt pure maple sugar from these misleading labeling requirements. https://t.co/z4mQLocHrVMy Democratic colleagues and I joined together earlier today to demand an immediate end to Trump’s zero tolerance policy. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/BjLyBtBQ6jThis afternoon, I co-introduced the Keep Families Together Act. I call on all elected officials, anyone with a heart or a moral compass, to immediately demand an end to this policy. The safety and health of children are at stake. #KeepFamiliesTogether

https://t.co/kMRphSMCO6Our nation’s veterans served to defend our values and to protect us, and we owe them access to the best quality health care. 

My full statement on the Manchester VA 2025 Task Force Final Report: https://t.co/XLbOnLZDeSToday, I spoke at a press conference and said Trump’s policy of ripping refugee children from their parents is doing irreparable harm. It must end. All children need their parents. https://t.co/zPZJd5Y5e7 https://t.co/BdbNk1ZijkThank you @NCAT_ORG for inviting me to address the Armed to Farm NH Seminar, which provides free training to veterans on how to run a farm. Separating servicemembers should have help learning a new trade or starting a business. I enjoyed taking their questions! https://t.co/6L1uv8GPxXThe Trump Administration’s policy of separating children from their parents is terrifying and frankly, abhorrent. My full statement with  social workers in Congress @RepBarbaraLee, @RepSusanDavis, @RepGutierrez, @RepKarenBass: https://t.co/EaEnqsRj6cI am pleased that the House passed my amendments to promptly dredge Hampton and Portsmouth harbors and help our state.

https://t.co/Jof1dMHpKHHad a wonderful time at the Experience New Hampshire event last night. Thank you to all the Granite Staters who showcased their businesses and products. And a big thank you to @senatorshaheen for once again organizing this great event! https://t.co/KqbYB7DynWAs a social worker, mother, and grandmother, I find this action by the Trump Administration ignorant, disgusting, and, frankly, terrifying, and am actively working to bring an end to this brutally inhumane policy. https://t.co/0zdoPoRO38Had a productive conversation yesterday with #EPA Regional Administrator Dunn about Pease, Coakley, &amp; St. Gobain. I encouraged her to set stronger limits on PFAS contamination in groundwater. I will continue working with her &amp; @repanniekuster to address this critical issue. https://t.co/IjK18sftc374 years ago, brave troops from the US, Canada, and Great Britain stormed the beaches of France to free Europe. We can never forget the sacrifice of the thousands of soldiers who lost their lives that day. In 2014, I went to Normandy &amp; met with the heroes who fought the battle. https://t.co/BybdrCafPtToday we honor the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our values, our freedom, and our nation. I visited Belleau Wood Battlefield &amp; American Cemetery, the site of one of the first WWI engagements for US forces, to pay my respects to America's fallen. https://t.co/mji8IeMsVRCongratulations to Sean Cheng (and the Cooperative Middle School in Stratham) who reached the #NatGeoBee finals! The Granite State is so proud of you! Your understanding of the world is very impressive!This afternoon, I joined a Democratic hearing on #gunviolence prevention featuring a panel of high schoolers who have been affected by violence. These kids are so brave and are leading the way in getting Congress to take action. It’s time for Speaker Ryan to listen. #neveragain https://t.co/MNueYgKszpPresident Trump is continuing his attacks on women’s health care. This rule will defund #PlannedParenthood &amp; other critical health care providers and limit access to health care for so many women who need it. It cannot be allowed to move forward. #TitleX 

https://t.co/woYlxpNNa0"Nobody knew what to do," a weeping student named Dakota told KPRC. "There was nothing we could do but run." There ARE things Congress can do. And we need to do them now! #NeverAgain.The Senate this week passed a resolution to overturn the FCC’s repeal of #netneutrality protections. I cosponsored the resolution in the House and signed a discharge petition to force a vote. Paul Ryan should put the resolution on the floor.The #FarmBill, which failed on the Floor, would have severely hurt seniors, children, veterans, and so many vulnerable populations. It was a shameful, cruel bill, and I am very surprised that House Republicans brought it to the Floor. My statement: https://t.co/0oJt7YnXVKToday begins #NationalPoliceWeek, when we honor and recognize our law enforcement officers for all they do every day to keep us safe. It is also a time to remember the fallen officers who lost their lives to protect us. We will never forget their sacrifice.The unemployment rate for #MilSpouses is 4 X the national average. It's #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay, a day to say thanks for their personal and financial sacrifices. Proud to have introduced a bill to incentivize hiring of mil spouses. https://t.co/PsiN76BVesDisposing of munitions in open-air burn pits poses unacceptable dangers to our servicemembers, veterans, and all who live and work near these installations. The Pentagon needs to stop this and take action to mitigate the ongoing threats to public health. https://t.co/q1hM4MDsJqThis is the right decision. Our Seacoast communities deserve answers about how PFC contamination is impacting their health.  https://t.co/pV55NTL8F4We should steer our nation down the pathway to a safer and more peaceful world, not the pathway to war. This decision will make Americans and people all across the world less safe. We should side with our allies and stay with them in the #IranDeal. 

My statement: https://t.co/S9iFGlv7teCongratulations @SoRockNH for receiving special recognition and a stipend from @NIAAAnews for this creative PSA on the impact of alcohol abuse on families. https://t.co/PDAQsYcnW9Today is #NationalTeacherAppreciationDay! Thanks to all who have dedicated their lives to educating our children and preparing the next generation of leaders. Our teachers deserve better pay and benefits.Jeffery Ballard, an RN @VAManchester, will throw out the first pitch at the #Redsox game on Nurse Appreciation Night, May 15.  This is such a well-deserved honor! Thank you Jeffery for your dedication to New Hampshire veterans. https://t.co/HhOFvAo3NENot clear to me at all, @SpeakerRyan. "To be clear, that decision was based on my duty to ensure that the House has the kind of pastoral services that it deserves."I &amp; three other Members led 148 of our colleagues in asking Paul Ryan why he fired Father Conroy. There was no good reason to force him out. Religious bias played a role. I'm very happy Father Conroy has decided to serve the remainder of his term. Ryan should let him stay. https://t.co/9IKaDSkXkkOn #WorldPressFreedomDay, we celebrate the free press, the 1st Amendment, &amp; the values we hold dear as a democratic society. We look to hardworking journalists to uncover the truth and strengthen our understanding of what’s happening in our country and all across the world.Happy National Small Business Week! SBs form the backbone of New Hampshire’s economy, representing nearly 96% of all NH businesses and employing 52% of NH employees. In Congress, I’m proud to support small businesses all year. #NationalSmallBusinessWeekToday is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. Please look around, and if you have any unused or expired medication, please bring it to your nearest collection site. You can locate the closest collection site at this website https://t.co/R0P2W9rB8yOne Member leading the search for Father Conroy’s replacement even said the next Chaplain should be someone who has adult children. https://t.co/ehgHGcbXplToday, three colleagues and I led 148 Members of Congress in sending a letter to Speaker Ryan asking why he fired Father Conroy, the Chaplain of the House. Ryan says because some Republican Members asked him to. Religious bias.Yesterday was Girls Inc. &amp; Tuesday’s Children Shadow Day on The Hill. Had so much fun showing Annicha, Ariella, and Olivia around the Capitol today! These girls rock! I hope you all had fun. https://t.co/e2fmD5OYyOCongratulations @ChiefWillard on being nominated as the next US Marshall! You’ve done a great job in Manchester. This is welcome news for the Granite State and our country!I am pleased that EPA recognizes the importance of the Breton’s Cleaners Brownfield project and will be providing a $200K grant to clean up the site. Somersworth has already committed resources to revitalize the riverfront, &amp; EPA’s recognition of those efforts is well deserved.We can't keep using dangerous fire fighting foam that contains PFCs, and which continues to contaminate bases and groundwater sources across the country. 

https://t.co/iScdBCzWXII am so pleased that this year’s National Defense Authorization Act will include nearly $150 million for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. We must continue to invest in this vital facility that creates jobs and is essential for the defense of our nation.

https://t.co/2YHYeSWh2HWe owe it to our states &amp; local governments to ensure they are prepared with the knowledge &amp; know-how to mitigate the impacts of #climatechange. I worked with @SenMarkey &amp; @RepDebDingell to introduce legislation to promote climate literacy in schools. https://t.co/GwkhcMGrbw19 years ago, 12 students and a teacher were killed at Columbine High School. Today, young people across the nation are making their voices heard and demanding that Congress finally take action to prevent gun violence. It’s time we listened.I am pleased that NH will get badly needed resources to help our communities, but overall, this grant is wholly inadequate. The administration awarded less than 1% of the total funding to the state with the third-highest mortality rate. https://t.co/dN9NpCy6ZjBarbara Bush was a remarkable woman who spoke honestly about what she believed. I am deeply saddened by her passing. The Bush family is in my thoughts and prayers.So proud of all those at the shipyard whose hard work and dedication have made it the “gold standard” for public shipyards. The economic impact is massive. I will continue to support PNS in Congress on the Armed Services Committee. 

https://t.co/4wDjHv3C59With just 27% of Americans believing the #GOPtaxscam was a good idea, it’s astounding that the WH dispatched two super-wealthy multi-millionaires to sell Granite Staters on how this plan will be good for the middle class when it’s clearly a massive tax giveaway to the wealthy.Most disgusting of all, the bill for this windfall for the wealthy will be nearly $2 trillion. Americans will have to pay for this in cuts to funding for education, infrastructure, the environment, and healthcare.When it comes to corporations, shareholders are seeing a windfall, with JP Morgan predicting stock buy-backs will rise from $527B last year to as much as $800B this year, while fewer than 45 of the large companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 have passed on any benefit to workers.Morgan Stanley predicted that just 13 percent of the #GOPtaxscam benefits will trickle down to workers while #WallStreet bonuses have jumped 17 percent to nearly $185,000.Six years ago, Greenland Police Chief Michael Maloney was killed in the line of duty while he was helping serve a warrant. The suspect was armed and opened fire on the officers. We will always remember Chief Maloney's bravery and service to his community. 
https://t.co/BuHJudCAb4This is outrageous. Pruitt has to go. #BootPruitt https://t.co/Ltyi9RQYtsLast night began Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel. We must never forget Nazi atrocities or stop working to prevent war crimes and human suffering across the globe.It's only fair that women get paid what they've earned! Small businesses, families, and our economy suffer when women earn just 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. Let’s pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct so more workers can have #EqualPayForEqualWork. #EqualPayDay55 years ago today, 129 sailors and civilians perished aboard the USS Thresher. Among those lost were many Granite Staters and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workers. We will never forget their sacrifice. I'll be introducing legislation to establish a memorial at Arlington Cemetery.I and 63 of my colleagues in the House demanded that President Trump #BootPruitt. His unethical behavior, waste of taxpayer money, and antagonistic attitude toward the core mission of the EPA are unacceptable. https://t.co/bETtjw9xI0The Sarah Long Bridge is essential for commerce &amp; the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. I am so glad that its replacement is finally here!  I worked with the Maine &amp; NH delegations to secure the federal funding needed to make this bridge a reality. 

https://t.co/pg1aTmdkNyThe next Secretary must protect the VA healthcare system from efforts to dismantle it. In August of last year, Secretary Shulkin made commitments to New Hampshire veterans. I still expect those commitments to be met. Anything less is unacceptable.Although I secured Fed funds in the past to support the dredging of Hampton Harbor, shoaling is making it impossible to access during low tides. Today, I sent a letter with the NH delegation, asking @USACEHQ to prioritize emergency dredging for Hampton harbor. https://t.co/LTxSJUThMkI signed the discharge petition to force a Floor vote on legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller from being fired. The #MuellerInvestigation must be allowed to follow the facts, wherever they lead. https://t.co/vF5pPDN8n1The Trump administration has failed to send our state the funding we need, and NH treatment &amp; recovery centers have struggled with funding. @HHSGov and @samhsagov must ensure that NH gets the resources our state needs. Waiting any longer is not an option.

https://t.co/LwDQmUrkpJPlease read my op-ed on gun violence and prevention. The youth of America want change, and they won’t be ignored. Today, they are marching all over the US for gun safety laws, with the slogan, “Never Again.”

https://t.co/WRlOopgMNdOur servicemembers are patriots. It is wrong to deny anyone with the courage to serve from joining or serving in our military because of who they are. As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I will work to oppose this hateful decision. These are not our values. https://t.co/t4e5xzZfC08 yrs ago, President Obama signed the #ACA, which I helped write. 

In New Hampshire:

63K gained insurance

7.5K are receiving opioid treatment through Medicaid

600K w/ a pre-existing condition have been guaranteed coverage 

21K seniors saved $24.1 M on Rx drugs in 2016 aloneOur Seacoast communities deserve to know how PFC contamination in groundwater supplies is impacting their health. I am pleased that I was able to secure funding for this first-of-a-kind health impact study in the government funding bill.The Manchester VAMC needs significant infrastructure investments. I am pleased the government spending bill we just passed includes $2 B for VA infrastructure. The VA must now prioritize &amp; fund projects that improve the condition of our facility in Manchester.The omnibus will provide badly needed resources for our state’s efforts to turn the tide in the deadly opioid crisis. The $142 M set-aside for the hardest-hit states will help NH. But we will still need the Trump admin to direct more resources to our state.Thank you VP Biden for visiting the Congressional Blue Collar Caucus today! https://t.co/cK9C16s8gUNew Hampshire treatment and recovery centers have waited long enough. New Hampshire needs funding, not photo-ops. 

My full statement on President Trump's visit below: https://t.co/jcHhVkl69qWithdrew from #ParisAgreement, ended #netneutrality, repealed #CleanPowerRule and @CFPB arbitration rule. 187 political appointees used to be lobbyists (35 worked for the Kochs!). Many oversee industries they used to lobby for. Who are they working for now? #Sunshineweek https://t.co/t2YUITbzfuI am heartbroken by the passing of my good friend and colleague Louise Slaughter. Louise was brilliant and effective, outspoken and fearless. And fun! I was blessed to be her friend and colleague.Congratulations to Phillips Exeter student Vinjai Vale, who just won 7th place in the #regeneronSTS 2018, a prestigious math and science competition for high school seniors. He competed with 40 finalists and over 1,800 applicants from across the country. Great job! https://t.co/gcKRSqW0UXAfter rallying with young people who are calling for gun safety legislation, I spoke on the Floor to call for change. When 18-year-olds are leading the country with moral courage, it’s time for us to respond in kind. We must pass gun legislation now! #neveragain https://t.co/WuEjAAzMrsDuring #sunshineweek, it’s clear conflicts of interest are everywhere in this White House. 5 Trump Org projects under scrutiny for ethics &amp; legal violations, and countless potential conflicts of interest! No oversight from House Republicans. Time to put #peopleoverprofits. https://t.co/yh5KzTp1O5This is a great day for Russia, whose embassy praised the decision to end the HPSCI investigation, &amp; a sad day for America. Ending it now confirms that it was a sham intended to shield Trump while brazenly disregarding our national security &amp; ignoring all intelligence experts.Some House Republicans are looking for ways to sneak an online sales tax into the government spending bill. They should not do this.  

https://t.co/mGRdXxxhW6On #InternationalWomensDay2018, we celebrate all the incredible women who have fought for our rights, equal pay, &amp; an end to gender-based discrimination. We will continue to work to empower women &amp; provide all our girls the education &amp; opportunities they deserve. #IWD2018 https://t.co/D7A8yNvanrI am so pleased that the Executive Council voted unanimously today to hang a portrait of Dudley in the Statehouse so that everyone who visits can learn about her distinguished career and her groundbreaking role in New Hampshire politics.I have been blessed to call Dudley Dudley a friend, and I have greatly admired her incredible public service and activism. As the first woman elected to the Executive Council, she helped pave the way for so many of us who have followed in her footsteps &amp; run for elective office.Five years ago, we successfully pressured Congressional Republicans to reauthorize a strong &amp; inclusive Violence Against Women Act. This was an important victory, but we know that more work needs to be done to stop sexual harassment and violence against women. #VAWA@WigginMemorial This well-deserved recognition highlights Wiggin Memorial Library’s outstanding work connecting the Stratham community to all of the wonderful services and opportunities available at our public libraries. Congratulations to all those who work there! #IMLSmedalsI founded the Asthma and Allergy Caucus in 2010 because Congress needs to increase research. Yesterday, I spoke at the Innovations in Asthma and COPD briefing in the Capitol. Progress being made! https://t.co/sWAMPT6foBThank you @LegionNH for all you do for our veterans! I enjoyed our conversation about veterans' health care in NH. Veterans deserve access to the highest quality health care. https://t.co/vhXtXTenSGI co-introduced a resolution today to reverse the FCC’s shameful repeal of #NetNeutrality. It has the support of 50 Senators, just one shy of what is needed to pass the Senate. Speaker Ryan &amp; his Republican majority should put the resolution on the floor &amp; help us pass it.Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress, was a fierce advocate for children and families. She truly was “unbought and unbossed.” I am proud to cosponsor a bill to place a statue of her in the Capitol that honors her incredible contributions to our country.Yesterday, I joined many of my colleagues in wearing red to support the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women campaign. #GoRedWearRed https://t.co/EpLksPoeu3I voted no on #HR620, which would place the burden of complying with the #ADA on the victims of discrimination rather than the entities that are in violation of the law. It is disturbing that Speaker Ryan is using his majority to attack the rights of people with disabilities. https://t.co/P7J1Ej3Tx0Children and families across the country rely on their leaders in Congress for much more than thoughts and prayers. They need us to take action to keep them safe. Speaker Ryan must put bills on the floor to address gun violence. https://t.co/Bx9rdp8NmeAnd yet, they keep happening. Every single week. This cannot continue—we need common sense laws to reduce gun violence. It’s the least we can do for all of the victims and their grieving families, friends, and communities.I am once again horrified and sickened by yet another massacre at an American school. This is at least the 18th school shooting this year. I am praying for the victims and their families. Parents and students should never have to endure such awful tragedies.We need to know how many WH staffers are being allowed to view sensitive information without a permanent security clearance. Chief of Staff John Kelly needs to come clean about what he knew and when he knew it regarding Rob Porter. https://t.co/eItop78GXXTomorrow, the House will try to pass #HR620, which would undermine the civil rights of people with disabilities. This is the latest bill by Speaker Ryan that would hurt people with disabilities after he tried last year to take away their health care. I will vote no.I agree! Lobstering is such an important part of our Seacoast economy, not to mention that lobsters are delicious! So happy @unicode is finally creating this long-overdue emoji! https://t.co/kgzZ3hhOzoIt is unacceptable that a pollster is leading the White House’s efforts to combat the opioid crisis and ignoring important recommendations from actual health policy experts. @ONDCP needs a director with experience and real qualifications in this field. https://t.co/f6Js7BvWMcThe House just passed the Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2017. This bipartisan legislation creates new safeguards in the representative payee program to protect beneficiaries against fraud. 
https://t.co/WqSn0iliApThe Family and Medical Leave Act was enacted 25 years ago today! #FMLA protections allow employees to take unpaid leave to care for their health or the health of a family member. Let’s build on FMLA’s success and pass the FAMILY Act to finally achieve PAID family &amp; medical leave.This was the right decision. I stand firmly behind NH's Indonesian community, and my office will continue advocating for these families, who fled religious persecution. They must be allowed to stay.

https://t.co/WuDpGOsIhSI’m honored @NormEisen will be my guest tonight at the #SOTU. He is a passionate defender of government ethics rules. https://t.co/0gqq0MeHhnI have always admired Ambassador Eisen’s outstanding public service, and I am delighted that he will be my guest tomorrow night at the State of the Union Address. #SOTUToday is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. We can never forget Nazi atrocities. We are all morally obligated to speak out against anti-Semitism and acts of hate in our own country and around the globe.This administration's response to the opioid crisis is pathetic. Trump didn't even give his own commission feedback on their final report.

We need more than empty gestures; we need emergency funding now!

https://t.co/vX8dDedvKRDonald Trump said a good shutdown is what the country needs. He wanted this. It’s time for Trump and the Republican majority to end this crisis. We need predictable funding for the military, the opioid epidemic, and for community health centers. #TrumpShutdownThe Trump administration’s response to the opioid crisis has been absolutely pathetic.The decision to cut funding for ONDCP by 95% is another example of this administration's failure to understand both the devastating nature and the urgency of this crisis. Full statement here: https://t.co/fRQkutO3P5The federal government must ensure that federal roads in New Hampshire are repaired and restored to good condition. I am pleased that the Federal Highway Administration is assisting the Forest Service with this important responsibility.

https://t.co/vYGkv3opa1I refuse to join House Republicans in abandoning the fundamental tasks of governing by kicking the can down the road yet again on the most basic responsibility we have, funding the government. Full statement here: https://t.co/hsCDkrY9JtToday, I cosponsored a resolution to censure President Trump over his racist comments on immigration. They were disgusting, and Congress should formally condemn them.This interview should have happened months ago.

Please take time, if you can, to participate and help others. #MLKDayAs my good friend John Lewis is fond of saying: When you see something that isn’t right, find a way to get in the way. Speak up, speak out, and get in good trouble.We have a responsibility to continue this fight until every child has equal opportunities and can enjoy the same measure of safety, until all our people can earn a living wage, and every citizen can exercise his or her right to vote."[W]e have difficult days ahead in the struggle for justice and peace, but I will not yield to a politic of despair. I’m going to maintain hope…"Dr. King knew that the struggle for progress, justice, and peace would be hard. In his letter from Birmingham Jail, Dr. King said:

"Human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of dedicated individuals…Trump continues to degrade the presidency. His racist language attacks the fundamental, shared values we all seek to uphold as Americans. I am disgusted.

https://t.co/RUFtbcNFD3Today, I joined @SenatorShaheen, @SenatorHassan, and @RepAnnieKuster to urge the Trump Administration to listen to our constituents and remove New Hampshire's coastline from his dangerous proposal to allow offshore drilling in the North Atlantic. https://t.co/ON0OBd9RrqThe 4th Amendment is clear: If the government wants to search an American’s communication records, it needs to get a warrant. I opposed continuing this program without enhanced privacy protections.

https://t.co/EZqkWJiz9ZThe full DOD audit I voted for is now underway. This long-sought effort will help Congress and DOD make better financial decisions and reduce waste, fraud, and abuse.

I will fight alongside bipartisan coastal state Govs to oppose. #nhpolitics https://t.co/Nk0KwULwchVictory! @POTUS calls off sham voting commission because citizens in NH and across the country pushed back against his dangerous, undemocratic anti-voting agenda.

https://t.co/0Ap4jV1CcJToday I refused to accept House Rs’ irresponsible &amp; pitiful excuse for a government funding bill. After securing a tax giveaway for billionaires and big corporations, Speaker Ryan decided to run away from the responsibilities that come with governing by kicking the can yet again. https://t.co/oANjZfNubE8.8m Americans enrolled in @HealthCareGov (96% of last year’s total), despite Trump Admin’s outrageous sabotage. TY to Navigators &amp; assisters for hard work helping families in NH #GetCovered, &amp; to all who helped defeat GOP efforts to repeal the #ACA – coverage is here to stay.Just yesterday, Serenity Place, the recovery center for the Manchester Safe Stations program where Trump adviser @KellyannePolls staged a photo op earlier this year, entered receivership. New Hampshire urgently needs funding, not photo ops, from this Administration.New Hampshire continues to suffer the second-highest drug overdose rate in the nation, underscoring the urgent need for increased federal assistance to fight the out-of-control opioid crisis. The Trump Admin must act now to provide emergency funding. #nhpolitics https://t.co/AHZ5xqb4EAToday’s tax bill will dramatically worsen our nation’s income inequality crisis. When inequality rises, the whole economy suffers. This bill was skewed to help the wealthiest, and it’s the American people who will end up paying the price. https://t.co/rfWqVA5wUJThe FCC’s decision to repeal #NetNeutrality rules will destroy the way we access the internet. We have to protect consumers. I urge our state AG to reconsider his decision and to join us in the fight for a free and open internet.Just this weekend, we learned that a special provision to benefit real estate investors such as Donald Trump was added in secret with almost no public debate or awareness. And now, struggling families across America will be saddled with the bill.At every turn, experts have found that this rushed and secretive process has led to legislative text that is riddled with mistakes and loopholes that tax lawyers and accountants will easily game for their wealthy clients.In just six weeks, Congressional Republicans wrote and passed a 500-page bill. They didn’t have a single hearing on a bill that touches almost every single person and business in this country.This lopsided giveaway to the wealthiest individuals and corporations will explode the debt by $1.45 trillion, setting the stage for automatic cuts to Medicare and other critical programs that assist working families and secure our nation.The GOP tax plan reduces the rate on the largest corporations by over one-third and lowers the top rate paid by millionaires.With their reckless process and shameful tax plan, Congressional Republicans have bestowed an enormously expensive gift to corporate lobbyists, multi-millionaires, and the largest corporations. And they got the middle class to pay for it.New Hampshire should be on the forefront of defending a free and open internet to maintain our economic competitiveness and protect Granite State consumers. Read my letter urging our Attorney General to take action. #netneutrality https://t.co/ts1SSzkQ9hThank you @RedCross for the opportunity to participate in the Holiday Mail for Heroes event this week.

The Internet has allowed the proud tradition of American ingenuity and entrepreneurship to reach every corner of the globe.Net neutrality is the simple principle that lawful content on the Internet should be equally accessible to everyone, and that Internet service providers should not be allowed to discriminate against some content providers.I strongly oppose the result of today’s shameful FCC vote, and I will work to restore the #NetNeutrality protections American consumers expect and deserve.The @VAManchester partnership with Frisbie is an important interim step toward ensuring that all New Hampshire veterans can get needed care locally. https://t.co/wZxRoSeYkzBut even after five years of inaction, I still have faith that the American people will keep their voices raised until Congress is forced to listen and pass laws to stop this sequence of avoidable tragedies, and to spare American families from such unimaginable grief.Year after year, they have banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal agencies from conducting research about gun violence as a public health threat.Not only have House Republicans failed to act, they have made our laws even less safe. Just last week, they passed the NRA’s top priority, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017.The failure of Republican Congressional leadership to act while 1,500 mass shootings have occurred on American soil since that awful December day is both immoral and inexcusable.After Sandy Hook, parents and communities across the country advocated for safer gun laws, but five years later, the Congressional majority continues to ignore their call to action.Five years ago, a gunman shot and killed 20 little children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. I am still praying for the families of those sweet six- and seven-year olds, who should be happy sixth graders right now.Sent a letter urging tax conferees to scrap their plan to tax grad students’ tuition waivers. Taxing waivers students receive for work as teaching or research assistants is a terrible idea that punishes those we should be encouraging –all to give a bigger break to the wealthiest. https://t.co/dB0TODxz4rWishing a happy and peaceful first night of Hanukkah to those celebrating in New Hampshire and around the world this evening.Together with almost 60 Congresswomen, I’m urging the House to investigate the many sexual misconduct allegations against President Donald Trump. Public officials must be held accountable for their behavior, regardless of office or party.
https://t.co/6EYxXocY5YPolitical attacks on Special Counsel Mueller’s probe are dangerous. He must be allowed to follow the facts, wherever they lead. That’s why I cosponsored Sen. Graham &amp; Rep. Jackson-Lee’s Special Counsel Independence Protection Act. The bill allows only a court to fire Mueller. https://t.co/rL3BLSA4PRThis morning, it was a pleasure to present the silver and bronze Congressional @TheAward medals to Tanner from Stratham for his community spirit, dedication, and hard work to complete the goals he set for himself as a participant in this wonderful program for young Americans. https://t.co/GtY3tjjHPARemembering the brave men and women we lost at Pearl Harbor 76 years ago today, honoring the sacrifice of all the Americans who served in WWII, and grateful to the troops who stand watch today.

But the road back needs to start now. That is why I am cosponsoring H.Res.621, ‘Articles impeaching Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors.’@SenBobCorker During a time when our nation faces serious threats around the world, this nation desperately needs a President who will work to build and unite, not threaten, divide, and destroy. There is no good or easy solution to the grave situation our country finds itself in.@SenBobCorker Donald Trump lacks integrity and has not been willing or able to assume the moral leadership and seriousness of purpose the United States needs from its President. At this point, it’s clear he never will.Many Members of Congress, including myself, agree w/@SenBobCorker that President Trump poses a dangerous threat to national security and the future of our democracy. I believe it is past time to put country before party and bring these discussions out into the open.As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, a former military spouse, and an advocate for our troops and their families, I have been appalled to see the Commander in Chief repeatedly make outrageous and irresponsible public statements that put our troops in more danger.&amp; added my name as a cosponsor of stronger articles of impeachment, H.Res.621, which focus on Trump’s attempts to obstruct justice throughout the FBI’s investigation of his campaign ties to Russia &amp; his attacks on our Constitution, including the 1st Amendment &amp; Emoluments Clause.I believe our nation needs to openly address the fact that Donald Trump’s bizarre and dishonest behavior in office is degrading the United States Presidency and making our world less safe. That is why today I voted ‘present’ on Congressman Green’s articles of impeachment ...As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am deeply concerned that this decision could provoke increased violence and instability in the region, and I believe it is a harmful setback to efforts to revive the peace process.The status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive topics in these discussions, and it should be part of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Palestine, not dictated through unilateral action by the President of the United States.President Trump’s plan to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem threatens American credibility in the region and undermines efforts to negotiate an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.Health insurance shouldn’t end at the neck, and neither should the VA’s standard medical benefits package. That’s why today I introduced a bill to offer dental care to all veterans. https://t.co/sVw6VSCIZm #nhpoliticsI will continue working to stop the Trump Administration from interfering with the Mueller special counsel probe’s independence, because the American people deserve the truth and nothing less. #nhpoliticsNow we know why President Trump pressed former FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation of Flynn and then fired Comey when he refused: an attempted obstruction of justice.Today’s admission of guilt by Flynn is a very serious development in the Mueller investigation. Flynn has admitted that he lied to the FBI while he was a top Trump Administration official about his contacts with Russia.Former Trump Administration National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is now the fourth member of Trump’s slimy orbit to face serious charges, joining former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign officials Richard Gates and George Papadopoulos.It’s past time for Congress to invest in fighting the raging opioid crisis on a scale that matches its severity, and this bill will spur a much-needed investment. #nhpolitics https://t.co/kbSgXXeFDLRight now our country is having a necessary and long-overdue discussion about sexual harassment and assault, and Congress must address its own institutional failures in order to credibly participate in that conversation. Today’s resolution is an important step. https://t.co/nnk4Z19Bj6Why can’t the White House take our nation’s out-of-control opioid crisis seriously? We need a serious, nonpartisan expert coordinating a national response – and Kellyanne Conway doesn’t fit the bill. #nhpolitics https://t.co/j1vNCV0bbEWant to make your voice heard on #NetNeutrality? You can contact the @FCC at 202-418-1000.All Americans deserve to be safe at work.
