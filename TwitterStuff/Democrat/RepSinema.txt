https://t.co/J0K4QDraTAToday we honor all #VietnamVeterans who served and sacrificed. #VietnamWarVeteransDay https://t.co/O2efqqODqGPoliticians in Washington don’t realize that the answers we need aren’t based on one party being right and the other party being wrong. Frankly, Arizonans don’t care whether there’s an R or a D next to your name, as long as you get the job done. #SinemaSoTDThe way forward has never been more clear. We desperately need leaders who will put country ahead of party, stop the fighting, and work together to find common ground. #SinemaSoTDI want to hear directly from you how we can bring more jobs to our state, and then work together to make it happen. #SinemaSoTDArizonans are hard-working and resourceful, but to stay competitive in today’s global marketplace, we need to ensure our workers develop the skills modern companies need. #SinemaSoTDOutdated regulations keep Arizona small businesses from growing and hiring more workers. We’re cutting red tape and bringing Washington up to the speed of Arizona small business. #SinemaSoTDI went to college because I knew that a good education would lead to a good job. Just like in my life, the chance to make a better life for everyday Arizonans all comes down to good-paying jobs. #SinemaSoTDWashington is reaching a level of chaos and dysfunction even I didn’t think was possible.  #SinemaSoTDWe reauthorized the Export-Import Bank to help Arizona companies compete on a level playing field abroad. #SinemaSoTDWhen we heard how the Medical Device Tax would harm local job growth, reduce access to capital, and slow research and development in Arizona, we stood up for common sense. Earlier this year, we delayed the tax for another two years.  #SinemaSoTDEvery time we talk, I hear the same message loud and clear: to continue to thrive, we have to put politics aside and come together on real solutions to our challenges. #SinemaSoTDMy job is to listen and learn from you--to figure out what’s working, what’s not, and how we can work together to expand opportunity for all Arizonans. #SinemaSoTDLIVE: Watch our State of the District address: https://t.co/MYBzMQDDCW #SinemaSoTDTODAY: Tune in live to our State of the District address!
