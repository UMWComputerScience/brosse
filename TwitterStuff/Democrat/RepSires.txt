123 members and I demanded the Inspector General of each department involved in the zero tolerance policy to investigate &amp; report on each department’s ability to reunite these children with their parents, beginning official federal action to bring these families togetherAlong with @WhipHoyer and my @HispanicCaucus colleagues, we demanded an official report from Homeland Security, DOJ, or HHS on the status and well-being of every child separated under the zero tolerance policy, holding these agencies accountable for their actionsH.R. 6135, the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct would ban any Homeland Security, DOJ, or HHS official from removing children under 18 from their parents or legal guardians, unless the child is determined to be in dangerThe fight against the Trump Admin.’s Zero Tolerance policy is ongoing. We will not let our country become a place that terrorizes families as a deterrent to seeking asylum. Here is what I am working on with my colleagues in Washington to #KeepFamiliesTogether:After the tragic events yesterday, @capgaznews journalists continued working in the face of violence to provide their community with the news.

My full statement: https://t.co/A4WxfDASQS#Janus attacks the very engine of growth for the middle class – unions. Workers’ ability to negotiate for fair wages, safe conditions, and secure retirement is fundamental to our economy. My full statement: https://t.co/DaQVHxZufaBeyond maddening to hear a President of the U.S. disparage our justice system &amp; call for the end of immigration courts. Our nation was founded on the tenets of due process, fair trials, &amp; human rights. These aren’t inconveniences, they're the foundation of our nation’s strength.As a nation we are currently facing many trying and critical issues, it is imperative that we move forward with civility at the forefront of debate during these pressing times.Recent events illustrate just how bitter our nation's politics have become. It is extremely important that we raise the level of discourse and treat everyone with respect regardless of political party.“Which leaves us facing a question: What kind of country are we? The world has been nervously asking that since November 2016.” https://t.co/qi0c1MWAoSProud to welcome the newest New Jersey’s newest American citizens at Kean University this week.

We must stand up for the vulnerable in these critical times.I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 6135, the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, which would end the 'zero-tolerance' policy of the Trump Administration. Forced family separation is inhumane and un-American. My full statement: https://t.co/AfEMc77suw https://t.co/Ls3Seh4qh8Outrageous that the House GOP and White House continue to shrug their shoulders at the separation crisis. When it has become our national policy to inflict unnecessary trauma on children and violate the rights of asylum seekers, inaction speaks volumes. #FamiliesBelongTogether“It was heart-wrenching in there. I came here when I was 11,” the 67-year-old Sires said. “It is a different country than when I came here. What I saw in there was inhumane.” https://t.co/6E5TCVFwS3They are being held in terrible conditions. They don’t know where their children have been taken. They don’t know when they will see them again. Congress can no longer act like this isn’t happening. We must put an end to these inhumane practices. #FamiliesBelongTogetherOn this #FathersDay, my colleagues and I decided to see firsthand the unfolding tragedy of family separation by ICE. At the Elizabeth detention center, we were not only denied access for 2 hours, but the fathers we met are suffering. https://t.co/dt8HZLbGMRI won’t back down from fighting for the Jersey shore.

Today, we are indebted to their sacrifice and honor their memory. #DDay74Forced family separation is not only traumatic but impacts the ability for both parents &amp; children to seek legal protection. Even more tragic, parents are often unable to find their children in the designated shelters. America cannot stand for this cruelty #FamiliesBelongTogetherSeparating children from their parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane &amp; cruel. Seeking asylum is not illegal, and threatening family unity is a twisted means of intimidation. #FamiliesBelongTogether#EnoughIsEnough On an average day in America, 96 people are killed by guns.

Our young people have demanded we act to change this reality of American life, it is time we listen.On Tuesday, my colleagues and I wrote to HHS Sec. Azar and detailed why #TitleX is so critical for millions of Americans. I will continue to push back against any moves by this Administration to restrict funding. #ProtectTitleXRestricting #TitleX funding is a deeply partisan, ideological attack on affordable health care for women. A “gag rule” on providers who offer abortion services would block access to cancer screenings, birth control, wellness exams and more for low-income women.I voted NO on the #GOPFarmBill because I will never vote for a bill that seeks to fundamentally cripple nutritional benefit programs.

To my House colleagues: now it’s our turn. Let’s bring this resolution up for a vote, pass it, and protect a free and open internet for all Americans.When the #GOPFarmBill cuts $23 billion out of SNAP funding, they’re shaving dollar &amp; pennies off the little assistance recipients have. If the GOP really wants to help working families get ahead, they’ll grapple with the reality of SNAP and stop trading in dangerous stereotypes.Throwing stricter work requirements on jobs that may already be vulnerable or unstable and wasting their time with job training programs is destructive. It prevents recipients from getting home, receiving the food they need, and keeping their families fed. #GOPFarmBillThe GOP would like to paint a picture of a luxury food assistance program that keeps Americans out of the workforce. The reality of SNAP is that the vast majority of adults who are required to work, do work, and are struggling to support their families. #GOPFarmBill- The average SNAP recipient only receives $132/month. 
- The average family on SNAP spends just 10 months in the program. 
- 2/3 of SNAP recipients are children, elderly, or the disabled.This month, celebrate the contributions that Asian and Pacific Islander Americans have given to American history, culture, and daily life #AAPI.

Now we know this scam only paid lip service to middle &amp; working class families, while giving away over $250 billion in corporate stock buyback schemes to executives: https://t.co/eNHXdlXAh8Last week, I called for Pruitt’s resignation or firing from the President and continue to call on my colleagues in both parties to do the same.Continued revelations about Scott Pruitt’s behavior confirm the obvious: he must resign. The GAO has now found that his private lair inside the EPA was an egregious misuse of taxpayer funds. https://t.co/lE9G6r6qfsWe cannot let radical political influences shut science out of the public arena. My colleagues &amp; I demand that Speaker Ryan allow us to vote on the Scientific Integrity Act, which would set standards across federal agencies for scientific credibility in public policy. https://t.co/51LTiKEgDbEl Salvador’s Catholic Conference of Bishops came in today to emphasize the importance of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. https://t.co/N5TQuTFelcLawyers from the New Jersey chapter of @AILANational joined me today to discuss the repeated attacks the Trump Administration has launched on immigrant communities. https://t.co/sEFXqHFXVJAttended @TransportDems markup this morning on legislation addressing the opioid crisis, natural disaster response, and economic development. https://t.co/8gM9wpptWgStep 1: Drain federal funds for handouts to the 1%. Step 2: Realize your plan explodes the deficit by $1.9 trillion. Step 3: Attack Social Security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid to cover up your mistake. Even GOP Sen. Bob Corker knows this “balanced budget amendment” is a dangerous sham. https://t.co/KnZobzPiG2A foolish, politically-motivated citizenship question on the census could actually risk billions in federal funding for law enforcement, fire, and safety units due to inaccurate numbers. I joined my CHC colleagues in requesting a meeting with Sec. Ross on this issue. https://t.co/cSC9YLaQCJProud to highlight communities in #NJ08 that were named Qualified Opportunity Zones by @USTreasury. Elizabeth, Kearny, Bayonne, Newark, Jersey City, West New York, &amp; Union City have all received tax incentives to spur long-term capital investments &amp; increase economic development.We are reminded on #HolocaustRemembranceDay each year that we must passionately fight for peace over hate time and time again. We can never forget the millions of innocent lives lost. #YomHashoahScott Pruitt has been nothing but toxic as an EPA Administrator in the pocket of lobbyists. That is why I joined 63 of my colleagues in a letter to President Trump demanding Pruitt be fired if he does not immediately resign. https://t.co/dzrRNNqEZxThis afternoon I met with Wakefern Food Corporation to discuss the most pressing issues in the New Jersey food industry. https://t.co/chF3YkyfuUDiscussed the critical work of the Legal Services Corporation program this afternoon with members of @NJStateBar https://t.co/N9XysQwgXTI attended the @HFACDemocrats hearing this morning to ensure the Trump Adminstration’s proposal to reform the Overseas Private Investment Corporation respects existing federal agencies and safeguards our standing in the world. https://t.co/lyLR473taZSchool Library Month and National Library Week are a time to celebrate all that libraries can transform – minds, classrooms, and communities. Thank you to all those who make these vibrant places of learning possible. #NLW18 #SLM18 #LibrariesTransform#Trump’s latest attacks on Mr. Mueller’s investigation threaten the very integrity of our democracy. Every Member should be alarmed at POTUS’ open threats to fire Mueller &amp; speak out against this flagrant assault on the rule of law. This demands action from Congress.Yesterday’s updated report from the CBO shows that the GOP’s tax plan will explode the national deficit by $1.9 trillion over the next decade. Republicans claimed this bill would grow the economy, but instead it will place a massive financial burden on future generations. https://t.co/VF5hguqw47While #Trump obsesses over his corruption scandals and wastes time getting his briefings from watching TV all day, the US is abdicating its role on the world stage. Meanwhile, countries like Iran, Russia, and Turkey jockey for power in Syria at the expense of the Syrian people. https://t.co/ijNHAn9vNkToday we commemorate an extraordinary man and the mission he left for the world. The legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. demands that we live out our highest values as Americans - equality, justice, and peace. #MLK50#WorldAutismAwarenessDay reminds us to embrace differences and celebrate those in our community with ASD.Happy Easter to #NJ08!Wishing a joyous Passover to all those celebrating in #NJ08!It's official. @TaxPolicyCenter shows that the #GOPTaxScam will hit NJ the hardest of all 50 states. In fact, over 10% of NJ households are expected to actually see a tax increase this year.Congratulations to the exceptional young people who organized the historic #MarchForOurLives this past weekend, drawing together massive crowds in DC and around the country. You have activated change within millions of Americans who know that #EnoughIsEnough.When the @NRA is handing out grades and picking teacher’s pets, I’m proud to stand against them and be at the bottom of their list with an “F” rating. https://t.co/nbvhKGG6xRMet with members of @CoptSolidarity this morning to discuss how Congress can work to stop persecution of Coptic Christians worldwide. https://t.co/GF1NzJoma4Sat down with important voices for freedom and democracy this afternoon. @cocofarinas, an iconic activist in Cuba, and Patricia Gutiérrez, Mayor of San Cristobal and opposition leader against Maduro’s regime, are examples of true bravery in the face of brutality https://t.co/CsQhY9krMFI spoke on behalf of my constituents and their family members who have been impacted by this disaster. I asked NGOs and businesses currently working in Puerto Rico about the current status of Medicare reimbursement and advocated for investment in permanent infrastructure. https://t.co/JhtDH2mcBESat down with Newark, Belleville, Jersey City, &amp; Bayonne residents to discuss their important work with @nothingbutnets.

Half a year since Hurricane Maria made landfall, residents are still lining up for water bottles and boxes of food. https://t.co/QEgb87bWm3#6MonthsAfterMaria Puerto Rico has shamefully still not received adequate help from the federal government. This was an historic disaster requiring an historic response. Our response in Puerto Rico should have been as rapid and intense as our response in Florida and Texas.Happy St. Patrick’s Day to New Jersey’s 8th District!The tragic loss of life this week on the East River was completely avoidable. As a result, @RepDonaldPayne joined me in contacting the FAA &amp; I am glad to hear today of their decision to ban “doors-off” helicopter flights. My full statement: https://t.co/qQaFbpkIcWHappy Founder’s Day to @WestPoint_USMA! For 216 years, you have produced outstanding servicemen and servicewomen for our country. #USMA #WestPointDeeply saddened to hear of the passing of my colleague, Rep. Louise Slaughter. She was a trailblazer and a champion of her district. Her presence here will be greatly missed.

Committing ourselves to equal access to quality public education is the best investment our nation can make.In 2016, @ASCETweets graded infrastructure in the US as a D+. Joseph Danatzko, a NJ resident &amp; ASCE member, discussed with me today real changes to infrastructure that would bring us out of this failing territory.  Sadly, Trump’s plan would keep us in the back of the class. https://t.co/2vh3uF7WXVSecretary DeVos’ interview on 60 Minutes only further demonstrates her lack of commitment to quality public education and her tenuous grasp on the reality facing our nation’s students.

The young people leading #NationalSchoolWalkout are an inspiration and I will be fighting in Congress to make sure their words are turned into action. #NeverAgain #Enough https://t.co/8QdWkovrCz#Tillerson’s dismissal is a sad reminder of #Trump’s contempt for diplomacy. Removing SecState while our country faces aggression from the likes of North Korea and Russia, displays yet again that the President values personal politics over the nation’s best interests.Thank you to @Defenders for a 100% on their 2017 Conservation Report Card. Proud to work in Congress to protect our natural heritage for future American generations.#InternationalWomensDay is a reminder for me and my colleagues in Congress that we cannot rest until full gender equality is realized in our country.The important work of @Ivan_Velasquez_ and the @CICIGgt must be protected and allowed to continue. The rule of law must be strengthened in #Guatemala and corruption must be weeded out at every turn. Proud to meet Ivan with my colleagues @RepPaulCook &amp; @RosLehtinen https://t.co/brIVTwKUrSThis afternoon, I met with the @bmsnews foundation to discuss their important work improving access to health care for rural, migrant &amp; under-served populations. https://t.co/AHaqo7TkoiDedicated planning for walking and bicycling commutes not only makes our communities more vibrant and successful, but encourages healthier habits. Discussed legislation supporting cycling with @BikeLeague this morning. https://t.co/nAlC0enPnqThis morning, I met with representatives of the Sugarbeet Growers Association to learn more about issues facing family farmers across the country. https://t.co/GQIV1bIW10New Jersey and New York already agreed to foot 50% of the Gateway Project, an unusually high amount, totaling over $15 billion. Now, native New Yorker President Trump has decided that’s still not enough and wants to kill the project. Spoke to @NY1 about this senseless move. https://t.co/BeojesFJNlI received updates yesterday on legislation impacting the housing and financial services industry with New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. https://t.co/t7r9gI4MwxDuring #NSBW18, I met yesterday with the New Jersey School Nutrition Association to discuss legislation in Congress that improves the availability and quality of federally funded meal programs for students. https://t.co/WuSevMFx4iI sat down with @AIPAC to discuss the continue hostility of Iran towards Israel. Congress must continue to support our critical ally in the region and work to strengthen our relationship with Israel. https://t.co/G5BLdvRC31Today, I met with @PFANJ_IAFF to discuss the fundamental importance of AFG and SAFER grants to the work that our firefighters do. I am proud to support the reauthorization of these programs and support their important work. https://t.co/b3UW20NRFLWhy does this Administration insist on targeting our region, first with the tax bill and now stalling Gateway, when we are one of the most important economic centers in the country? https://t.co/zIfmmpQAawI asked Secretary Elaine Chao of @USDOT why the Trump Administration has, beyond all reason, torpedoed the Gateway Project that would repair critical infrastructure in New Jersey and New York. https://t.co/ofOxhecLvoThe court’s temporary injunctions are not a permanent solution, Congress must act immediately and pass a #CleanDreamAct now. https://t.co/m393SEL4rD6 months ago, President Trump initiated a crisis by setting an arbitrary deadline for #DACA with absolutely no plan for a resolution. Today we arrive at that deadline as the White House &amp; Congress continue to drag their feet to protect these young #Dreamers.The worsening situation in Venezuela continues to demand the world’s attention. We cannot let the injustices of Maduro’s regime go unchecked. Yesterday, I spoke to concerned Venezuelan-Americans about the ways the United States can help. https://t.co/NJXnpj8i6QMet with Ambassador Fernando Oris de Roa of @ARGinUSA to discuss the important relationship between #Argentina and the United States https://t.co/tPU7HHC8rQSat down with the New Jersey chapter of United Postmasters and Managers of America to discuss legislation impacting the postal service industry. https://t.co/MECVPJKiEqMichael Wilson of Bayonne from the @AmericanLegion joined me yesterday in DC to discuss legislative priorities for veterans in 2018. We are indebted to these brave men and women for their service and Congress must support them every way we can. https://t.co/Sq2rusisdiProud to stand up for Net Neutrality, and be an original cosponsor of the H.J.Res 129. This resolution is Congress’ chance to restore important Title II protections and stand against the FCC’s decision last year. https://t.co/nSkVA3r5NtSomehow the federal budget for Housing &amp; Urban Development doesn’t have enough room for Community Development Block Grants, but we magically have money for a new dining room table? Secretary Carson’s actions are despicable.Standing today with my House &amp; Senate colleagues for the introduction of our #NetNeutrality CRA, it is clear that we have the momentum to overturn the @FCC’s disastrous decision from two months ago. The Senate needs just #OneMoreVote to preserve Net Neutrality &amp; #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/qvAYiKHoJ2In the coming weeks, I plan on addressing even more aspects of the gun violence epidemic with my colleagues. This most recent mass shooting in Florida can be the last. Congress has not only the power, but the duty to act now.H.R. 4052, Keep Americans Safe Act, prohibits the transfer or possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices that hold greater than ten rounds. Large capacity magazines have been central to so many of these tragic mass shooting and have often increased their deadliness.H.Res. 370, titled Moments of Silence Are Not Enough, ties displays of sincerity to action. The House would be required to follow any moment of silence held for a tragedy involving gun violence with a committee hearing on the issue within 10 legislative days.H.R. 3947, the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, bans the creation, possession, transfer, or sale of bump stocks and other firearm accessories that convert semi-automatic guns to fully automatic. There is no reason this vicious loophole should be open any longer.H.R. 3962, the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2017, requires any individual who orders ammunition online to verify their identification in person with a licensed dealer. The bill would also require vendors to report exceptionally large sales to the U.S. Attorney General.When I return to Washington on Monday, I will continue to demand that Speaker Ryan bring up legislation immediately to address the epidemic of gun violence in America. There are a number of bills I have cosponsored along with my colleagues that we can begin consideration of:Emergency Migration and Refugee Assistance is cruelly eliminated in the #TrumpBudget, along with a 17% cut to remaining Migration and Refugee Assistance Accounts, continuing a pattern of targeting some of the most vulnerable populations in the world#TrumpBudget includes a $3 billion loss in humanitarian assistance, 23% cut to global health funding, and 20% cut to PEPFAR, the president’s emergency plan to fight AIDSAfter a disastrous year on the global stage, the Trump Administration still does not heed bipartisan calls to change directions on foreign affairs. #TrumpBudget learns nothing from their mistakes &amp; wants to slash International Affairs Budget by 30%#TrumpBudget plays favorites with the education budget, decreasing Dept. of Education by $3.6 billion, but instituting $1.5 billion for private school voucher programs. Destabilizing our public education, a bedrock of our democracy, just to boost private and charter schools#TrumpBudget continues this Administration’s vengeance against environmental protections. EPA loses 25% of its funding under the plan.#Russia attacked our democracy and they will attack again. In light of today’s serious indictments by Special Counsel #Mueller, President Trump must enforce bipartisan sanctions against Russia for the sake of our electoral system. My statement: https://t.co/RbbWlh5NiNFebruary is #AmericanHeartMonth. Learn more about how you can take preventative measures such as stress management and healthy eating: https://t.co/K8Sh3VNJqaThe only real infrastructure action in the #TrumpBudget is asking state and local governments to shoulder the costs of a grand plan. This long-awaited package is half-baked at best.Amtrak grants get the chop in #TrumpBudget, down to $738 million down from $1.5 billion in FY17#TrumpBudget merely points out that the Highway Trust Fund, which funds the restoration of our roads, will run out of money by FY2023. Yet, it does not offer any solutions.#TrumpBudget slashes the Department of Transportation’s discretionary spending by 19.2%, from $19.3 billion to $15.6 billion, crippling chances of even securing the infrastructure we already havePresident Trump has dreams of a grand transformation of our nation’s infrastructure, but when it comes to the #TrumpBudget it’s clear his Administration isn’t serious at allMy heart breaks for the 17 innocent lives lost yesterday in Parkland.  It is a national tragedy that Congress has yet to enact comprehensive gun reform legislation in the face of these senseless shootings. I call on Speaker Ryan to act now: https://t.co/33y3gEUyi1This morning, I attended a Subcommittee on Railroads &amp; Pipelines hearing on the continuing process of installing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology in the US. Passenger safety depends on the future of PTC &amp; we cannot delay the process any longer.The Organization for American States can do more to promote democracy &amp; human rights for Latin America. Today’s Western Hemisphere Subcommittee examined how the US can further work with @OAS_official to address its challenges &amp; foster its important leadership for the region.Met today with @njfop, New Jersey members of the world’s largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers, to discuss legislative issues important to law enforcement in New Jersey. https://t.co/UtgUgCvpqjEntrepreneurs and small business owners from the 8th District came to D.C. today and discussed challenges and opportunities for growth in our community. https://t.co/0iDAyWBrTNLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps families experiencing energy crises manage their bills and weatherize their homes. #TrumpBudget eliminates the program entirely, quite literally leaving families out in the coldThe HOME Investment Partnership Program is the largest federal block grant to states designed exclusively to build affordable housing for low-income households. Gutting it attacks the backbone of our nation’s efforts to address housing inequality #TrumpBudgetCommunity Development Block Grants are also central to the funding of Meals on Wheels. #TrumpBudget would leave the program in crisis.Community Development Block Grants are the indispensable, flexible tool for local governments to execute projects as ordinary as sidewalk repairs and as critical as emergency response. CDBG was vital for NJ’s response to Hurricane Sandy. #TrumpBudget cuts them entirely.#TrumpBudget apparently believes that housing isn’t a problem for millions of Americans &amp; eliminates Community Development Block Grants, the HOME Investment Partnership Program, &amp; the Low Income Energy Assistance Program#TrumpBudget risks pushing vulnerable families into homelessness and further burdens those already experiencing homelessness. In addition to cutting the Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development by 14%, it cruelly eliminates funding for repairs to public housing.The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant helps keep families together and prepares low-income parents with job training. #TrumpBudget slashes TANF grant by $1.7 billion in just one year.Since his days on the campaign trail, President Trump has long promised a bold, aggressive, state-of-the art infrastructure package. Unfortunately, the plan his Administration unveiled yesterday is a certified lemon. My statement: https://t.co/Pdighu4PSFIn addition, #TrumpBudget even weakens what would be left of Medicaid. Imposing work requirements and substituting block grants for funding would effectively choke the program’s reach. This is simply not a plan that seeks to help vulnerable patients and their families in any way.#TrumpBudget carries the mantle of this administration’s vicious attack on health care, cutting ACA cost-sharing reduction payments that help low-income patients pay for out-of-pocket costs and issuing a devastating $554 billion cut to Medicare and $250 billion cut to MedicaidAnd would there even be enough money to fill the box? #TrumpBudget reduces the SNAP program by $17.2 billion in one year and $213.5 billion over 10 years. There is no awareness of how important this program is to vulnerable American families.After one Trump Administration contract barely delivered 0.02% of promised meals to Puerto Rico, I have trouble putting faith in the President’s idea of converting SNAP into a box delivery service #TrumpBudgetThe #TrumpBudget both undermines protections for the middle class and openly attacks the elderly and vulnerableI am proud to see NJ step up to help Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria and will continue to fight for hurricane victims through my work in DC.Here in DC, I joined the successful fight to block FEMA’s premature end of food and water distribution on the island and worked with my colleagues to secure additional federal funding for schools that take in displaced students.Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico over 5 months ago, but full relief has yet to be delivered and a return to normalcy seems tragically far away. Yesterday, I spoke at @GovMurphy’s signing of EO #10, creating a commission to assist the 30,000 displaced Puerto Ricans in NJ. https://t.co/GlKCb3i4ksParades won’t fund health clinics for servicemembers or programs that help disabled veterans adjust to civilian life.

Hoping all those at the scene remain safe.The President’s speech last night included exactly what was expected. Equation of immigrants to criminals, hollow promises on infrastructure, and a promotion of policies that will hurt American workers. My statement: https://t.co/qMy4UIvECWTonight I will be on @NJTVNews @Telemundo @News12NJ &amp; @CNNEspanol discussing my decision to not attend the State of the Union. I hope the President comes to understand that we want a leader who stands up for every American.The 8th District is home to thousands of immigrants, myself included. We will not stand for this extreme rhetoric and behavior that erodes the office of the President and our nation’s values.This past year, I’ve heard repeatedly from my constituents about the vitriol coming from this President directed at immigrants. It is not normal and simply unjustifiable.Today #WeRemember how quickly hatred and prejudice can grow into injustice and tragedy.

We already have bipartisan solutions to the problems we face and legislation ready for a vote. When will the #GOP – the governing party – finally come to the table?The Pentagon desperately needs certainty for their budgeting. Our military cannot live and die by every four week scuffle that Congress coughs up. National security depends on long-term planning and stability.The Republicans have owned both chambers of Congress and the White House for an entire year and have yet to provide a budget for our government. What is taking them so long? #TrumpShutdownFor months, we have urged the #GOP to work with us to fund the government and avoid this #TrumpShutdown. Now time has run out, and we are being asked to support another short-term CR that ensures more chaos and confusion for our government.I’m here in DC ready to fund our military, protect 800,000 Americans, fully support Community Health Centers, &amp; end this #TrumpShutdown.

Into the new year, I will continue to fight for all New Jerseyans.4) Repeatedly tried to strip away health insurance for over 900,000 vulnerable New Jerseyans by repealing the Affordable Care Act3) Torched protections for the colossally important Jersey Shore, opening it up to dangerous and potentially disastrous offshore drilling projects2) Waffled on his Administration’s commitment to the seriously important Gateway Tunnel project in Newark, potentially killing the huge economic boost it would provide to the region1) Gutted the federal state and local tax deduction &amp; increased the share NJ residents pay in federal income tax, all in a state that already disproportionately sends more money to Washington than it receives in servicesToday is not only the beginning of the #TrumpShutdown, but the one year anniversary of this Administration. In honor of this eventful year, here’s a look back on what exactly President Trump has delivered for New Jersey:Due to the #TrumpShutdown federally funded agencies are preparing pink slips to go out to employees.  The chaos of the White House and the GOP has put critical services that millions rely on, like health care, at risk.Proud that my bipartisan bill with Rep. @MarioDB, the Global Health Innovation Act of 2017, passed the House last night by a vote of 423-3.

After his outstanding work as superintendent of Asbury Park, New Jersey’s future will be in great hands.It is disgusting that the President of the United States has no regard for American values or the immigrant experience.

I’m joining a bipartisan group of my NJ colleagues to send a letter to Sec.

Trump, a former Atlantic City business owner, doesn’t understand how important the shore is to the Jersey economy. Opening all U.S. waters to offshore drilling was foolish from the start, but now they want to play favorites &amp; give exemptions?These individuals will lose their livelihoods, and New Jersey will lose the $448.3 million these Salvadoran residents generate in annual state GDP. Far more seriously, 3,900 American children in New Jersey now stand to lose their parents #SaveTPSThe 200,000 Salvadorans that the President targeted yesterday were forced from their country by devastating earthquakes. Now, they are being forced to give up the stable lives they’ve built here &amp; return to a still-recovering nation dealing with serious systemic violence #SaveTPSThe decision to end TPS is politically motivated and extremely reckless. Salvadorans who receive Temporary Protected Status are taxpaying residents of the United States, have passed multiple background checks, and are productive members of their communities #SaveTPSJanuary marks the 126th anniversary of Ellis Island, a proud landmark of the 8th District. For 12 million people, Ellis Island was their first step on to American shores. Today, let us celebrate the island’s importance to American history and our legacy as a nation of immigrantsAttacking productive, legal members of our communities is no way to build up our economy and society.

Safeguarding our environment and fortifying our own health begins with protecting endangered and threatened species.Americans loudly opposed the GOP tax plan by a 2-to-1 margin, and somehow this is cause for a White House celebration? House GOP needs to get back to work.Celebrating a tax plan where 83% of the benefits will only go to the richest 1% of Americans is ridiculous. Doing so while CHIP remains unfunded and our government nears a shutdown is downright shameful.Today’s tax bill re-vote underscores what a sloppy, rushed process this has been. Real tax reform is not just a talking point, but delivers meaningful, lasting change for American families. Not special deductions for the rich.Read why I voted No on the GOP tax plan: https://t.co/XCcBWGWsRa https://t.co/V4Yt6ikP4ZCarved out benefits for private jets &amp; permanent reductions in the corporate tax rate. The House GOP has just gifted the wealthiest Americans an unbelievable Christmas present, and paid for it by blowing up our national debt.My statement: https://t.co/72B0eCFjR8 https://t.co/UzX2ddfLZVBecause of the GOP leadership’s unwillingness to repair DACA, 12,641 DREAMers have lost their status, throwing their lives into chaos. As a cosponsor of the bipartisan Dream Act, I have been working with my colleagues to support a clean passage of this necessary legislation.#DidYouKnow that today is New Jersey’s 230th birthday? On December 18, 1787 New Jersey was admitted as the 3rd state to the union.

Spread the word in these final hours and help everyone #GetCovered for 2018.If you don’t already, make sure to check out my website https://t.co/vYWEZNntgH for the Washington Review, a recap of the previous week in D.C. Stay up to date on all that my colleagues &amp; I are working on day to day! https://t.co/NezoCWJx6K#SandyHook was a tragedy none of us will soon forget. My colleagues and I are wearing green ribbons today to honor the 20 children and 6 educators who lost their lives. My thoughts all day will be with their families. We must do more to protect our communities. https://t.co/2QjR22cX93Today, 118 of my colleagues &amp; I contacted Chairman Pai and asked him to stop tomorrow’s #NetNeutrality vote and remove it from their agenda. The FCC’s deeply flawed process has been conducted in secrecy and haste.Happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating!11,912 #DACA recipients have lost their status since the program ended. We need a clean #DreamActNow. It is irresponsible &amp; immoral that we would leave our nation’s young people with this burden. Today, I met with a group of DREAMers to listen to their stories. https://t.co/IVFuLGuRlAToday marks 2 years since the adoption of the #ParisAgreement, a historic international achievement. Though this Administration has foolishly decided to withdraw from this agreement, I am #StillIn to combat climate change and care for our planet’s future.Thank you to all those who have helped spread the word about the Open Enrollment period. Although https://t.co/8jE5luIsiL is closed today, there are 5 days left to enroll in health insurance in 2018. https://t.co/ZFYIciW241I will continue to push for these measures that especially affect our nation's young people, and work with my colleagues to pass a stable, long term budget.Short term stop-gap funding is no way to govern or deliver solutions for American citizens. Keeping our gov't open is an obvious objective, but bipartisan priorities like passing a clean Dream Act &amp; reauthorizing CHIP absolutely must be addressed before the end of the fiscal yearMy statement on the FCC's Net Neutrality Proposal: https://t.co/NBLM6MG39VAttended @HFACDemocrats and pressed the State Department on how the unprecedented exit of senior officials weakens our country’s security. Effective American diplomacy cannot continue when 60% of our senior diplomats have left or been pushed out. https://t.co/0UNj8nKp7uToday, we remember the 2,403 men and women who lost their life at Pearl Harbor in service to their country. #PearlHarbor76My colleagues &amp; I met with Richard Gere, Chairman of @SaveTibetOrg, to discuss the brutal oppression of the Tibetan people. The world cannot turn away from this tragedy. https://t.co/hv8k959qmSWhen the GOP writes tax legislation that cares more about golf course owners than students, seniors, or working class families, I cannot stay silent. I spoke on the House floor this morning about my opposition to this disastrous GOP tax plan. https://t.co/QBECxB2d7wMet with @STARZ network to discuss their business in New Jersey https://t.co/UGFElZzQfPDiscussed the security interests and challenges for the United States and the European Union with @ZdzKrasnodebski, a Polish Member of the @Europarl_EN https://t.co/22ox8g7b2jOnly 10 days left until the close of the Open Enrollment period. Log on to https://t.co/8jE5luIsiL today. https://t.co/TX0lJ4DEFoAmericans loudly rejected the Republican’s awful attempt at health care reform. Why are they now using the #GOPTaxScam to again increase the burden of medical costs on those already suffering?Tonight, our fight against the #GOPTaxScam does not end. We cannot allow a plan that raises taxes on 82 million Americans, kicks 13 million Americans off health care, &amp; adds $1.7 trillion to the debt to burden our country.When the wealthiest Americans will receive 52 times the tax breaks of middle class families, it’s no secret who the #GOPTaxScam is designed to benefit#DYK Last week, NASA successfully fired up thrusters on #Voyager1 spacecraft after 37 yrs. #Voyager1 is NASA’s farthest &amp; fastest! https://t.co/MvJJg15Hz6Wear red today in honor of #WorldAIDSDay.

Today, my colleagues &amp; I met with him to receive updates on these efforts. https://t.co/zH4gx8qIIAAs a cosponsor of H.Res.630, I am extremely pleased to see its passage today. Requiring every Member &amp; employee of the House to take part in sexual harassment training is long overdue and an important first step to changing the culture in Congress.Since the decision to end DACA, an estimated 10,088 recipients have lost their protection. Congress must pass the #DREAMAct now and provide a permanent solution for these young people. #ProtectDREAMersHappy Thanksgiving #NJ08! Make sure your celebration’s cook knows the USDA’s Meat &amp; Poultry hotline to avoid any holiday-related emergencies. https://t.co/vzWuG2y5l6Haiti has still not recovered from its 2010 earthquake, made even worse by Hurricane Matthew in 2016. They are in absolutely no position to handle the return of 59,000 Haitians. https://t.co/Y3hXMkjO24The Administration’s decision to end TPS for Haitians is yet another cruel attack on immigrants, already a vulnerable population in this country. These men and women have called the United States home for years, contributing to our economy and society every day.In West New York on Friday, NJ Democrats from all branches of our government came together with community health advocates to bring attention to the continuing Open Enrollment period. Visit https://t.co/46QqFGloFF before Dec 15 to sign up for health insurance https://t.co/BOSfJD2CnrWe must do better than this GOP tax plan. I am disappointed in today’s vote, but will continue fighting against this cruel plan as it moves to the Senate. New Jerseyans &amp; all Americans deserve so much better.

Now, as DACA recpeients, their hard work and future success is in jeopardy. https://t.co/wKathok91WTomorrow, I will be voting No on the GOP Tax bill and am encouraging my colleagues to do the same.

Sat down with @PPActionNJ this morning to discuss legislative priorities for this Congress https://t.co/NRLvS3ITSM40% of all NJ households claim state or local tax deductions, which would be wiped out in the GOP tax bill.
