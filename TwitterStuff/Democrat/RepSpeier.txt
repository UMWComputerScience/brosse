What a twisted and dark White House – filled with wife beaters, racists, and bullies. https://t.co/Ps4GjMfKO8Allegations against @USA_Taekwondo @TeamUSA are further proof the Olympics Community willingly sacrifices athletes' safety on the altar of gold, silver &amp; bronze medals. That is why we have demanded reforms to this toxic system that protects predators. https://t.co/xEZdEudKhHShe spoke for 8 hours and 5 minutes in 4 inch heels because #DACADreamers kids are worth it! #DACAbuster https://t.co/efJuQaSRLqParade loving @POTUS is turning into a little Napoleon, minus time in the trenches, donning fatigues, or fighting for our country. https://t.co/g1maR6GLHRTalking about the historic passage of the CAA Reform Act, a bipartisan bill to overhaul Congress’s flawed sexual harassment &amp; discrimination complaint process. It empowers victims &amp; holds Members accountable. But our work is not done. We must address harassment everywhere #MeToo https://t.co/yxn06MftByDear @POTUS : you’ve called the #OpioidEpidemic it a national emergency. But those are just words. Put some money where your mouth is and fund the #opioid response program at $25 billion for 5 years.#ICYMI -- I spoke on the House floor about the passage of the CAA Reform Act - a complete overhaul of the flawed complaint process for sexual harassment in Congress. Members of Congress will no longer be able to use tax payer funds to cover up their abuses https://t.co/C7EIeFUEVzSpeaking on the House floor in this historic moment as Ds &amp; Rs come together to clean our own House and take a great step forward in eliminating sexual harassment and violence in Congress. Next step is every workplace - from boardrooms to break rooms across the US. #metoo https://t.co/Rj1cLF4gtkProud to join @GreggHarper
@RepBrady @RepByrne @SusanWBrooks @RepTedDeutch &amp; the House Admin Committee at 4 https://t.co/P0QRBLd02J to celebrate the House vote on the CAA Reform Act - b/c it's time for Congress to get its House in order! #MeToo #TimesUp https://t.co/y0UMI8NQ0OMy sad prediction -- @HouseIntelComm Republicans just scored a major pass, knowing @POTUS will have the final say on the #DemMemo - Nyet!25 yrs ago, the FMLA provided women w/ support to stay in the workforce &amp; rise to leadership roles. When women lead, we see less sexual harassment in the workplace. #Paidleavemeans making sexual harassment a thing of the past! We need #nationalfamilyleave for all! #FMLA25Ricardo: They call us #Dreamers, but how can we be Dreamers if we can’t even sleep at night? https://t.co/bkjuYyQf2DSpending time in Half Moon Bay getting to know #Dreamers who are protected by #DACA. These young people deserve to be protected and allowed to live in the United States, the only home they know. https://t.co/jt9NqDcG82.@POTUS’ #NuclearPostureReview  proposes nuclear responses for non-nuclear threats – an unacceptable escalation. Nuclear wars have no winners. We must not descend into chaos fueled by POTUS’ insecurity over the size of his nuclear button.Wonder if the President will crow about the biggest drop in the stock market in the last two years. Must be Obama’s fault.Our dog Buddy is from the #HumaneSociety — It’s a great organization. Their CEO is not. The Board made a big mistake and will lose big.  https://t.co/ktM7Nfe0VsAbout to talk to @AriMelber on @MSNBC about the #FakeMemo https://t.co/zKR9OWGtJU.@POTUS is cannibalizing our intelligence community for his own political gain. His corrupt actions - pushing this #FakeMemo - are drawing targets on the backs on the men and women tasked with defending our national security and keeping America safe. https://t.co/HA6vPXOimeThis is Putin’s fantasy come to life. If he had created a Manchurian candidate, he couldn’t have dreamed that his operative would be so effective at destroying our defenses from within. #PutinsPuppet https://t.co/KkGKiyLqiAThank you  @SenJohnThune - Glad to see saner minds prevailing with some in Republican Leadership. Now it’s time for @SpeakerRyan to do his job and put his country before his party.  https://t.co/QRHcR811dyTalking about the new tax law at a packed town hall at the College of San Mateo. Who knew taxes could draw such a crowd! https://t.co/t0mn3dpEA1@USDOL’s #TipTheft proposal would let employers take tips from hard-working Americans. Almost 80% of the BILLIONS in lost tips would be taken from women, &amp; CA workers would lose $90 million! Even worse, DOL tried to conceal estimates from the public. They must withdraw the rule!ALERT: Today is the last day to enroll for health insurance for 2018. Chat with a #CoveredCA representative online, over-the-phone, or in-person to #GetCovered:

You can watch too at https://t.co/vaR8fEydJe@KeshaRose's performance at the #Grammys last night gave me chills -- I applaud her and all the women on the stage for standing up for what's right. As @JanelleMonae said, "We mean business" #TIMESUP! #MeToo grammys #MeTooBack in Pacifica exactly a year later for a Conversation about America: One Year of Trump. Anything been going on lately?! https://t.co/rjswDktCxSProud to announce my #SOTU2018 guest is @travismoore - a strong advocate for survivors of sexual harassment in Congress who, with @circlekdc , organized over 1,500 former congressional staff in demanding the House &amp; Senate reform the broken complaint process! #MeToo #TimesUpThere's no prison sentence harsh enough for a monster like #Nassar. But it's clear he's not the only guilty party.

Slight smart phone/tweet typo. That should say GIGANTIC high heels! @CecileRichards @PPFADOD's director of operational testing found only 50% of F-35 fighter jets actually work. So why did the Pentagon buy them in bulk before they were thoroughly tested?  We shouldn't be buying advanced weapons systems like someone who just joined Costco. https://t.co/qY8zXv06So.@CecileRichards, thank you for being a rockstar champion for women’s health and rights your entire life and for 12 years at @ppmn. You leave gig ace high heels to fill and will be missed..@jes_chastain @octaviaspencer That’s true girl power! Women standing up for each other and for equal pay! You are blazing the trail for ALL women to overcome unfair racial and gender pay disparities - in Hollywood and beyond! #EqualPay #MeToo #ERAnowRidiculous that a guy who has a history of abusing his authority is now NPS deputy director. Why would we promote bad behavior? Furthermore, if you don’t aid and abet @POTUS lies, you and your career will suffer.
https://t.co/tIEWBgpy4C#TrumpGlobalGag does not protect life; instead, it puts life-saving #SRHR services out of reach of the most vulnerable, including millions of women and girls. #EndGagNow https://t.co/Z3p9mGeanJCongratulations @SenDuckworth on your wonderful news, and for breaking another barrier as the first US Senator to give birth while in Congress. Wishing you and your growing family good health and happiness! https://t.co/TdYh6goKz9“I am heartbroken to hear about the school shooting in Kentucky - the 2nd nationally in 2 days! I grieve for the families who have lost their children and those who are injured. When is enough, enough? #KentuckySchoolShootingThis is not a way to run a government. As SecDef Mattis said, over 30 different CRs over 9 years is placing our troops at greater risk. We need a budget not a CR that fails to provide for comm health centers, &amp; extracts NO real commitment to help #DREAMers. That why I voted NO.For 45 years, Roe v. Wade has affirmed the constitutional rights of women to safe, legal abortions. It’s under constant attack – including 19 states adopting 63 new restrictions in 2017 and the Hyde Amdt. That is why I #RiseUp4Roe &amp; will always work to #ProtectRoe #BeBoldEndHyde https://t.co/VeKQPPWqFbWhether it’s noon, midnight, or any hour between, @HouseDemocrats are ready to vote on a compromise that benefits all Americans. There is strong bipartisan support for children’s health, military funding &amp; #DACA. Only @POTUS stands in the way.  https://t.co/DWoIgVggADSenate Democrats and Republicans are working on a compromise right now, and I and my colleagues in the House are ready for a 3 am vote. It’s time to fix the mess @POTUS made by his lack of leadership. We can end the #TrumpShutdown‘To believe that you can successfully blame Democrats for a shutdown over the DACA debate is naïve.’ – Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) [1/15/18]‘I think it’s a loser for everybody, but it’s probably more of a loser if you’re in control.’ – Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) [1/10/18]‘We can’t blame it on the Democrats because we control the House and have a Republican president.’ – Rep. Peter King (R-NY) [1/2/18]‘I think it’s the president’s fault. He hasn’t led. No question in my mind about that. He hasn’t led on this or many other issues … we’ll all get blamed but mostly the Republican administration will get blamed — as they should.’ – Rep. Dave Trott (R-MI) [1/19/18]This is what rank-and-file Republicans are saying about the #TrumpShutdown ...I have news for you Mr. President. This isn’t a game or some backhanded deal with your rich oligarch friends. This is the health and safety of our country, and the support of our troops. #DoYourJobThe difference is @POTUS orchestrating the #TrumpShutdown to serve his own needs. This isn’t about America First or Making America Great Again. There is only one winner in his game.Republicans and Democrats in Congress have, in all previous shutdowns, always been able to agree to fund payment for our troops – so what’s different this time?Even worse, @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell just blocked Senate Democrats from passing a measure that would have guaranteed our troops are paid during the #Trumpshutdown.The #TrumpShutdown will continue to hurt troop readiness by making planning and budgeting for the DoD and Pentagon even more backlogged and off budget.Sec Def Mattis noted last year that we’ve had 9 years of CRs, and last year Congress enacted 30 separate continuing resolutions on the DoD, placing our “troops at greater risk.” https://t.co/86MSJumpKRThe reality is that we have passed 3 short-term CRs since Oct. 1, that’s 110 days, because House and Senate Republicans and @POTUS were focused on sneaking their #GOPTaxScam through in the dead of night, to the exclusion of running the government and passing a budget..@POTUS and Republicans are using our troops’ missing paychecks as a pawn in their political gamesmanship and the #Trumpshutdown – which is good for only @POTUS, as he gleefully bragged last year. https://t.co/AFHgk78urgI and the @HouseDemWomen have come to together to call for an end to the #Trumpshutdown and for Good faith negotiations. Kids can’t use #CHIP health care coverage if funding for our community health clinics is killed. This isn’t a political show. Real lives are at stake! https://t.co/Ydq8hFw0BhProud to join @HouseDemWomen in our call for a long term budget that covers all bipartisan priorities, including our troops, the health of our children &amp; families, &amp; #DACA &amp; #Dreamers — issues Ds &amp; Rs can and have agreed on, but are now being held hostage by the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/jDaWiAOUsNThe President and Congressional Republicans are claiming the government shutdown is the work of Democrats, but don’t let them fool you. This is a #TrumpShutdown and a failure of House and Senate Republicans to do their jobs and put their country before their party! #DoYourJob https://t.co/TDVYFrbD38HISTORIC FAILURE: The #TrumpShutdown is the 5th GOP government shutdown in under 30 years – and the FIRST where they’ve controlled the entire government.The priorities Americans want to see addressed (pensions, DREAMers, health care for kids, etc) aren’t controversial. So why did Republicans choose a #TrumpShutdown over these bipartisan ideas?I and my colleagues are hard at work in the Capitol to end #TrumpShutdown – while Republicans are pouting about missing #Davos2018. So much for America first.The #TrumpShutdown…
-Threatens public health &amp; consumer safety
-Disrupts our economy &amp; job creation
-Blocks services &amp; investments critical to our families &amp; our communitiesWant to understand the threat that the #TrumpShutdown poses to American families? Here’s some info on the economic devastation wrought by the last GOP shutdown. https://t.co/n8C51qKmVvRepublicans worked days and nights to ram through giveaways for the richest 1% w/the #GOPTaxScam, giving corps a tax break to outsource manufacturing jobs to foreign countries! Now they refuse to address children’s health, #ProtectDREAMers, or pass a budget. #TrumpShutdownThe govt costs more money to shut down than keep open. The 2013 shutdown cost our economy &gt;$20 billion in lost growth plus $2.5 billion for furloughed workers, $11 million lost in national parks &amp; interest on late payments. Republicans need to figure out how to govern! #DoYourJobWatch the House Democratic leaders live update on the #TrumpShutdown here. https://t.co/nxTnpOfAkx.@HouseGOP @SenateGOP and @POTUS keep politicizing our military, but the reality is their failure to govern and reliance on years of continuing resolutions has hurt military readiness. https://t.co/xc6vw3cIhV https://t.co/sf3bbo3IdI.@POTUS boasts shutdown would be great for him -- his actions &amp; words make it clear he is his only priority. Governing in a democracy requires compromise and leadership, something the President continuously fails to do or understand. @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP must #DoYourJob https://t.co/8gIZx4GSND#ICYMI - I talked to @mitchellreports about the need for Congress to stay in DC until a deal is made to avoid a gov #shutdown &amp; @POTUS 's callous &amp; false claims at the #MarchforLife despite years of his #Prochoice stance. You can watch it here: https://t.co/6z655oySNTThe Trump Administration has made a #LicensetoDiscriminate a major priority -- issuing a new rule that allows employers, health plans and schools  to take control of women’s bodies, and futures, by refusing to cover #birthcontrol #AYearOfTrump https://t.co/CVYS2xqgGVThere is nothing moral about @HHSGov letting medical professionals deny patients of essential healthcare on so-called religious or moral grounds.
