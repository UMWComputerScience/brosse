Today the House rejected a #BalancedBudgetAmendment that threatens seniors' hard-earned Social Security &amp; Medicare benefits.

It’s time for action. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/QDdFGNnNwvAcross the country, students are walking out of schools because they‘re tired of feeling unsafe in classrooms. They’re walking out because they refuse to accept school shootings as the new normal. I’m motivated by their action. #NationalSchoolWalkoutWe’re currently accepting applications for our 2018 summer internship program. It’s a great way for #FL07 students to earn academic credit, learn about the legislative process, hone their skills, and help families in central FL. The deadline is March 30. https://t.co/QMXqpMX6EA https://t.co/6B7u7ceb0zSpoke to Brian Williams on @MSNBC @11thHour last night re my reaction to POTUS' proposal on guns.

When I was a child my parents encouraged me to be anything I wanted to be—whether that meant becoming a teacher, a member of Congress, or yes, even an athlete. We must all work to inspire and empower girls around the world. https://t.co/ifl59FfYeOGrateful to all the women who fought—continue to fight—for gender equality around the world. As the mom of this very independent little girl, I’m especially thankful to those who blazed a trail for my generation and my daughter’s generation. #IWD2018 https://t.co/zGw8LPiIkuSpoke to parents from central Florida yesterday whose children have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

Yet the #DickeyAmendment prevents meaningful research into gun violence. My bill, #HR1478, repeals it. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/TIIkSfrZ8OResidents of #PuertoRico were granted US citizenship 101 yrs ago this week. They‘ve since made countless contributions to our nation in times of war &amp; peace. However, as a US territory, PR is treated unfairly under federal law. I support statehood &amp; full equality for Puerto Rico..@UCF_Football star @ShaquemGriffin continues to inspire with his talent, character and courage. Look forward to watching him play on Sundays. https://t.co/DWwSUuzoCVICYMI: I spoke to @CBSNews about my push to repeal the #DickeyAmendment.

“This issue isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American issue. It is a public health crisis.” #EndGunViolence https://t.co/I09zRUd9PeThe U.S. &amp; Israel have an unbreakable bond, built on shared values &amp; shared interests.
