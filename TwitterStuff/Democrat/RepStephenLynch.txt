Rather than spending precious time and resources trying to deploy a military force into outer space, the President should focus on doing his job by nominating qualified ambassadors to these important posts.This year more than 150 military generals and admirals wrote a letter to President Trump to express the importance of strong diplomacy in keeping America safe and keeping our men and women off the battlefield.Meanwhile President Trump has proposed cutting the State Dept budget by 30 percent as these posts remain vacant.... however, 18 months into his administration, Trump has failed to nominate ambassadors to dozens of nations, including countries where U.S. diplomacy is absolutely critical: 
Egypt
Honduras
Jordan
Libya
Mexico
Qatar
Saudi Arabia
TurkeyPresident Trump says his government reorganization plan aims to “enhance [the U.S.] global presence” and “ensure the most efficient allocation of personnel consistent with U.S. interests around the world”... https://t.co/NxleHlawBi... to identify and return as many American military personnel to their families as quickly as possible. Our service members and their families have waited long enough and they deserve nothing less. (4/4)The amendment was included in the Defense Appropriations Act passed in the House today. This added funding will ensure the DPAA is able to speedily perform the forensic analysis... (3/4)It is critical that the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency is able to move quickly to bring home our fallen heroes. Given the urgency, this week I proposed an amendment that provides an additional $10 million to the DPAA to expedite this process. (2/4)There are 5,300 U.S. military personnel who remain listed as missing in action and presumed deceased during the Korean War. The recent agreement with North Korea allows us to recover, identify, and bring home the remains of these brave Americans. (1/4) https://t.co/zVfHEu2HoGI will continue to fight to ensure that workers have dignity, fairness, and a strong voice in the workplace.This decision undermines decades of precedent that protects the freedom of public service workers like teachers, police officers, and firefighters to negotiate for fair pay and safe workplaces. Unions are a force for good and are critical to rebuilding the middle class.Today the Supreme Court ruled against unions’ right to collect fees for services they are required to provide to all workers.H.R. 6136 was no “compromise” as the Republicans claimed – it was an attempt to cut down on legal immigration while addressing none of the real issues with our current immigration policy.It also would have made it more difficult for people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to seek asylum in the U.S. – a tenet our country was founded upon and that U.S. immigration law guarantees.This bill would have also ended the program that allows U.S. citizens to sponsor their siblings and married children for legal immigration to the U.S.H.R. 6136 would have ended the visa lottery program – a legal and effective program that treats immigrants from different regions of the globe equally and carefully vets applicants before they are granted green cards.Today I voted no on the immigration bill that was defeated in the House. Here’s why:Three years ago marriage equality became the law of the land, but #LGBTQ people still face discrimination across this country. I urge my colleagues to pass the #EqualityAct to prohibit housing, employment, and other discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.Wells Fargo robbed customers by setting up fake accounts and charging unauthorized fees. They were fined $1 billion. But then to the rescue came the Republican tax bill to benefit WF more than any other bank. Meanwhile regular working Americans get only a temporary tax cut. https://t.co/7A6U1CRcZDH.R. 4760 includes similar policies that would curtail legal immigration, like ending the visa lottery program and reducing the number of citizens and legal permanent residents who can sponsor family members for green cards.H.R. 6136 is no “compromise” as the Republicans claim – it’s an attempt to cut down on legal immigration while addressing none of the real issues with our current immigration policy.H.R. 6136 would also make it more difficult for people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to seek asylum in the U.S. – a tenet our country was founded upon and that U.S. immigration law guarantees.This bill would also end the program that allows U.S. citizens to sponsor their siblings and married children for legal immigration to the U.S.H.R. 6136 would end the visa lottery program – a legal and effective program that treats immigrants from different regions of the globe equally and carefully vets applicants before they are granted green cards.I am opposed to both immigration bills being voted on in the House tomorrow. Neither of these bills would help fix the current issues we face in our immigration system.If Republicans are serious about ending the separation of children and parents at the border, they should help us pass this bill and send it to @POTUS for his signature. #KeepFamiliesTogetherActThis week I joined more than 190 Democrats on the Keep Families Together Act, which would bar U.S. officials from separating children from their parents at the border.It was my pleasure to march with my friend @MayorTomKoch and see everyone in attendance having a great time! (And a Happy Fathers’ Day!) #QuincyFlagDayParade https://t.co/HyIo4Q2PkRBeautiful night and huge patriotic crowds at the annual Quincy Flag Day Parade, a wonderful Quincy tradition held every year since 1952 when it was started by Mayor Tom Koch’s dad. #QuincyFlagDayParade https://t.co/MlozfAqXOxThis week @USOCC Comptroller Otting – who is responsible for making sure banks don’t discriminate – told my colleague @RepCapuano that he had never witnessed discrimination and refused to acknowledge discrimination even exists in America. #OCCnoColor https://t.co/oMDC2nwbPWTune in to 1030AM or listen to WBZ NewsRadio on https://t.co/aJZGTJykAq at 9:05pm. I'll be talking to Dan Rea about my recent trip to the Middle East.The Trump administration’s new asylum policy that removes children from the custody of their parents is cruel and unnecessary. I signed on to H.Res.927, which describes this policy as child abuse and commits to a more humane asylum policy.I had a wonderful time at the 15th Annual Taste of Hingham. Great to see so many people celebrating and supporting the local merchants, restaurants and performers - a true testament to Hingham’s strong sense of community. #TasteOfHingham https://t.co/pw1ngP0oFKThe @FCC repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect today but the fight for a free and open internet continues as we try to pass legislation in the House that will overturn the FCC’s decision.Great to see so many people at Town Meeting engaged in grass roots local government. https://t.co/zYJH6imvxbHuge turnout at West Bridgewater Town Meeting.

Thank you Town Administrator Jim Johnson and Chairman Eric Kraus for the invite. https://t.co/R9oM1mF2IMIt was an honor to stand alongside men and women currently serving in Lebanon, including the U.S. Marine detachment from the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, to remember those who were taken from us as they sought peace here and throughout the Middle East. More: https://t.co/nmVm4RjJXV https://t.co/nrQEUc2PgAThis morning I met with our dedicated U.S. Marine Security Guards stationed in Amman, Jordan. https://t.co/y5BAiYwwj3On Sunday I visited with members of Jordan’s Quick Reaction Force in Zarqa, Jordan. They are being trained by U.S. Marines to conduct highly-specialized counterterrorism operations. https://t.co/jUN8lmSG27Today we remember and honor the brave men and women who have served and made the greatest sacrifices in defense of our basic freedoms. On this Memorial Day, may our national tributes to those heroic Americans lift the burden of Gold Star families everywhere.As part of my visit to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet serving in Bahrain, I met with Gov. Ali bin Abulhussain Al-Asfoor of Bahrain’s Northern Governorate. https://t.co/g7GAjtdXKVToday I visited U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and the U.S. Fifth Fleet and met with a detachment of U.S. sailors from Massachusetts serving in Bahrain. https://t.co/VJ8p4zjSfOIn December I stopped by to speak with some folks who were outside the FCC in Washington to demand a free and open internet. We must continue to raise our voices until we have overturned the FCC’s harmful decision. https://t.co/VmoQthZwDVThere has been a groundswell of support to #SaveTheInternet since the @FCC decided to reverse #NetNeutrality rules in December. Last week the Senate voted to overturn the decision, and this week I joined my colleagues to petition House leadership to let us vote to do the same.Governing is about making choices and decisions. This is a major health crisis. This is something the White House needs to pay attention to and be held accountable for.Yesterday I introduced an amendment to H.R. 5925 that would hold the Trump administration accountable for repeatedly missing this deadline by requiring them to report directly to Congress if there is any further delay and explain why the strategy was not produced.Congress authorized a funding increase of $3.2B for opioid addiction prevention and treatment. But we cannot just throw money at this problem without a strategy. It's the responsibility of @POTUS and executive branch agencies to articulate and coordinate a cohesive national plan.The President is required by law to release a National Drug Control Strategy in February of each year, but he missed that deadline in 2017 and again this year. Congress must make sure this does not happen again.The opioid epidemic is taking 115 American lives a day. We are facing a devastating public health emergency and it is deeply troubling that 16 months after taking office, the Trump administration still has not introduced a National Drug Control Strategy to combat this crisis. https://t.co/Br1UmPXMrsIt is shameful that Congress is weakening rules that protect American taxpayers and the U.S. economy. #S2155#S2155 weakens critical consumer protections that were put in place after the financial crisis and makes it easier for banks to issue the risky home loans that led to the financial crisis.#S2155 makes it more likely that big banks will resume risky behavior and that taxpayers will once again be required to bail out the biggest banks when they fail.Today I voted against #S2155 because it is another big give-away to the nation’s biggest banks.My heart aches for the families and friends of the Stoughton students involved in yesterday's car crash in East Bridgewater. My prayers are with you as you mourn this tragic loss.Democrats have proposed numerous common-sense gun safety bills that would help make our children safer, but Republican leadership refuses to bring these bills to the House floor for a vote. Congressional leadership needs to allow us to vote and protect our kids.My prayers are with the victims of the tragedy in Santa Fe, TX, their families, and the courageous first responders. It is outrageous that there has been another school shooting in America with absolutely no effort from congressional leadership to pass any gun safety measures.Just months after giving massive tax breaks to corporations and adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt, Republicans are shamefully trying to pay for it by cutting food aid to children and struggling Americans.Today I voted against reducing food assistance for children, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities. The #GOPFarmBill would have cut free school meals for 265,000 low-income kids.Today the Senate voted to overturn the @FCC reckless decision to end #NetNeutrality. The House votes next and it will be a tough fight. We must continue to raise our voices in support of a free and open internet.Excellent presentation on Town finances at Norwood Town Meeting last night. Thank you Town Moderator David Hern for allowing me to give a brief update of recent developments in Congress. Congratulations to Norwood’s Military Academy attendees and Peace Corps Volunteers. https://t.co/b5nxJlZe6bI also got to meet with Canton High students working to educate the public on substance abuse prevention - and Junior High students working on climate change - very inspiring. https://t.co/OXCn60yZmFHappy to attend the Canton Town Meeting last night, my thanks to Town Moderator Dick Staiti for allowing me to provide a Washington update. Encouraging to see such a great turnout of Town Meeting members to discuss local issues. https://t.co/kNLQHvBQgMIt is important that members of Congress have ready access to this data so we can monitor the effectiveness of our strategy in the region and that the American people are fully informed.The Trump administration's policies have made it more difficult for members of Congress – and nearly impossible for the public – to access information about the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. https://t.co/l6MZD4AE2pThank you to the Walpole Recreation Department for hosting such a great event.

The time to pass common-sense gun legislation is NOW. #EndGunViolenceNo one law will end gun violence, but we must take steps to reduce these tragedies on our streets and in our schools, churches, and offices. #EndGunViolenceIt is past time for Congress to step up and pass gun reform legislation that will protect our students and all of our loved ones. #EndGunViolenceThis massive failure was predictable and preventable. #PuertoRico #6MonthsAfterMariaIt is unacceptable that more than 6 months after Hurricanes Maria and Irma, FEMA still cannot tell us why they awarded a $156M contract to a 1-person company with a troublesome business record to provide 30 million emergency meals to families suffering after the hurricanes in PR. https://t.co/TVpY1BvrAyWhile I fully support this bill, there is much more work to be done, and we must keep our government open and working to address all of America’s priorities.... $8.8 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which rejects President Trump’s attempt to reduce the EPA’s budget by 31 percent.... $80 billion for national defense, including a 2.4 percent cost-of-living pay increase for our sons and daughters in uniform.... $37.1 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for medical research – a $3 billion increase in funding.... $10 billion in new infrastructure funding, including increases of $2.55 billion for the federal highway program, $1 billion for TIGER grants, which fund road, transit and maritime projects, and $600 million for rural broadband infrastructure.... $13 billion for Special Education Part B State Grants (IDEA), an increase of $275 million in funding.... $9.9 billion for Head Start, which is $610 million more than 2017 funding.... $5.2 billion for Child Care and Development Block Grants, which is a $2.37 billion increase over 2017 funding....

This provides two years of funding for screening, preventative care, mental health services, and other essential care for nearly one million Massachusetts residents regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.... $5.4 billion in total funding for all of our fantastic Community Health Centers across the country and in the 8th District, from Brockton, Dorchester, South Boston and the North End to Quincy and Hull and beyond.... and this funding will help institutions like the Gavin Foundation's Cushing House in South Boston and recovery home in Quincy continue to combat the opioid crisis until we end this devastating epidemic once and for all.... A $3.2 billion increase in funding for opioid addiction prevention and treatment. Nearly 2,000 people in Massachusetts died of opioid-related causes in 2017...... This funding increases the chance that necessary renovations at the VA hospitals in Brockton and West Roxbury get done sooner, giving our military veterans the care they need and deserve when they return home....

I support legislation that will #SavetheInternetThis morning I attended the Kennedy Center’s Mid-Winter Breakfast in Quincy where the food was great and the company was even better. Thank you to Mayor Tom Koch and Director Tom Clasby for allowing me to say a few words, I had a wonderful time. https://t.co/n9tW0c0Ag6I joined Jon Keller this morning to talk about congressional leadership's inaction on gun safety measures and how Democrats can return to being the party of the people. Watch here: https://t.co/EULbskbxcJI'm talking to Dan Rea on WBZ Newsradio tonight at 8pm. I look forward to taking your calls. Tune in to 1030AM or listen on https://t.co/aJZGTJykAq.Earlier this week I met with folks at Linden Ponds in Hingham. We had a great conversation about how the budget deal will affect seniors, veterans, and working families in the 8th District. Thank you for your hospitality! https://t.co/y4M7ImvTgTI'll be on Boston Public Radio at 1pm today. Tune in to 89.7FM or listen online: https://t.co/0mKO2yWOONIt was an honor to join the @gavinfoundation this week for the ribbon cutting of their recovery home in Quincy and to recognize @mayortomkoch for his leadership combatting the opioid crisis. Thank you all for your commitment to ending this devastating epidemic. https://t.co/Ab6dbtEnU7We cannot wait for another tragedy at a school or a church or an office to act. We must vote on these bills so members of Congress can be held accountable and, hopefully, create new laws that will keep our children and our loved ones safe from gun violence.The Select Committee on Gun Violence Prevention would investigate causes of mass shootings, the background check system, closing loopholes that give domestic abusers access to firearms, and the implementation of gun violence prevention laws, while respecting the 2nd Amendment.The Gun Show Loophole Closing Act would require purchases at gun shows to be subject to the same background checks that are required at gun stores.The Handgun Trigger Safety Act would authorize grants for the development of new technology that allows only an authorized user to fire a handgun. The legislation would also require that newly manufactured handguns include this technology.The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act would make it easier for federal law enforcement to go after people who buy guns for those who are prohibited from buying guns by making such purchases a felony offense.The Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act would ban the sale or possession of bump stocks like those used by the shooter in the Las Vegas attack last fall. These devices effectively turn semi-automatic rifles into automatic weapons.The Keep Americans Safe Act would prohibit large-capacity magazines like the ones used in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It is endorsed by law enforcement organizations like the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association....But Republican leadership has prevented these bills from even coming to the House floor for a vote. In this session of Congress alone, Republican leadership has refused to vote on dozens of bills including:No one gun law will prevent every shooting in our country, but there are actions we can take to reduce gun violence and save lives. As this epidemic of gun violence has progressed, many members of Congress have introduced legislation that would keep Americans safer....Thank you to @BetterMarkets for all the work you do to give a voice to the concerns of American consumers and individual investors. https://t.co/0G0RVnuHGMNo single law will prevent gun violence, but we owe it to victims, their families, and the American people to act. Common-sense gun laws will make Americans safer.Today we again mourn the loss of life due to gun violence at one of our nation’s schools. This is the 18th school shooting this year.Community health centers like South Boston Community Health provide vital care to 27 million Americans, and they rely on federal funding to do it. Congress ought to pass long-term funding for these centers – not continue funding for a year or two at a time. https://t.co/GVIoHJzO4DAmericans deserve the truth. The Intelligence Committee should release the Democratic memo. Republicans are using misleading classified info to protect @POTUS Trump and attack the FBI at the expense of our national security.Diplomacy is key to our national security, but @POTUS Trump has proposed a 31% budget cut to the State Department and has yet to nominate ambassadors to Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. #SOTUA large-scale infrastructure plan would benefit all Americans but we can’t do that without a budget.Americans deserve the truth about Russian hacking in US elections. Oversight Committee leadership must DO ITS JOB! https://t.co/93JbjoTeuzI voted NO on the House continuing resolution because it provides inadequate resources for veterans, community health centers, the fight against the opioid epidemic, and #DACA recipients. We cannot keep funding the government weeks at a time.We cannot continue to fund the government a few weeks at a time. We need a long-term funding bill that includes resources for veterans, community health centers, and the fight against the opioid epidemic.The government funding bill fails to address critical needs in Mass. and beyond: funding for community health centers, resources to fight the opioid epidemic, and a permanent fix for DACA recipients.The FAA must update its aircraft registration system to require beneficial ownership information so we can better identify individuals and aircraft that pose a danger to national security and public safety. https://t.co/Qk2eVkumiWAs we honor Dr. King today, we should all remember the values that he espoused and that we as Americans have long held dear: compassion for those in need, basic respect for all members of our communities, and a firm commitment to achieving justice and equality for all. #MLKDayAfter @POTUS disgraceful comments on Thursday, @RepCummings and I renewed our call for an investigation into the Trump administration's efforts to suppress and doctor a recent report highlighting the positive economic contributions of refugees. https://t.co/dRX2KmMwOZPresident Trump should be ashamed of his comments about Haiti, El Salvador and African nations. He must publicly apologize. His words were offensive and an affront to American values.President Trump should publicly apologize for his disgraceful comments regarding Haiti, El Salvador and African nations. He continues to degrade the Office of the President and diminish the United States’ standing in the global community. @POTUSIt was an honor to join Mayor Tom Koch at the swearing-in of the Quincy City Council last night. Congratulations to the councilors and to the unanimously-elected president, Brad Croall.

Sending warm wishes and thanks to those in our armed forces who are away from family this holiday season. Thank you for your service.The House just passed a bill that simply pushes a government shutdown into next month and inadequately addresses overdue priorities like VA funding and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This is NO way to run a government.Sent a letter to Deputy AG Rosenstein urging him to allow Special Counsel Mueller to continue investigation of the Trump campaign. Mr. Mueller has bipartisan support and should be allowed to continue without political influence or threats to his authority. https://t.co/dwoaf1ct7XOn days like today, after watching Republicans pass one of the most shameful bills in recent history, it is good to have a reminder of what democracy is supposed to be about: serving the public good, morality, and truth. https://t.co/VtaUKmSj5YThis is what happens when you try to jam a massive tax overhaul through Congress at the last minute: mistakes. Clearly Republicans are not giving this bill or the American people the consideration they deserve. https://t.co/D2Y4fd5FjaCongress should be creating a tax system that helps the middle class and hard-working families, but instead Republicans just jammed through a plan that will help corporations and the wealthy while raising taxes on millions of hard-working Americans.The @FCC will vote this morning on #NetNeutrality rules. We must say NO to handing power to big corporations at the expense of public access to information. I am calling on Chairman @AjitPaiFCC to keep our internet free and open to all.I am calling on Chairman @AjitPaiFCC to delay the vote to repeal #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/74rN7Due1iI stand with those braving the cold outside the FCC tonight in support of #NetNeutrality.

You can sign up for future updates from our office here: https://t.co/KRsF8VmIAC
 
Read today's e-newsletter here: https://t.co/7GrdTbHDr6Changes to our tax system will affect every American. Congress should work together to create a system that benefits hard working families. Instead R’s are jamming through a plan that benefits corporations and the ultra-wealthy.Republicans want to lower the corporate tax rate while raising taxes on millions in the middle class. The #GOPTaxPlan is bad for working families.Residents of MA’s 8th District claim an average of $15,000 in state and local tax deductions. The #GOPTaxPlan would eliminate the itemized deduction for these taxes, disproportionally hurting residents of MA and other high-tax states.This week I cosponsored House Resolution 630, which requires members of Congress and employees to complete workplace harassment training. This won’t end harassment, but it’s an important first step to making necessary changes to the current system. https://t.co/njrPvaBEG0Tune in to Channel 5 at 11am today: I'll be talking to @WuWCVB and @EdWCVB during WCVB's On the Record. https://t.co/HFBk5Dje1qTaking away #NetNeutrality gives telecom companies control over which websites and services consumers can access.

Here's to a happy &amp; healthy retirement! https://t.co/WH4bn6ONy6Seniors spend nearly 20% of their income on health care expenses. The #GOPTaxPlan would eliminate the medical expense deduction many seniors use to get relief from their medical bills.We should be working together to come up with a tax plan that benefits the middle class and hard working families. Instead Republicans are helping corporations and the wealthy by jamming the #GOPTaxPlan through Congress.The #GOPTaxPlan gives tax breaks to corporations on the backs of hard working, middle class Americans.Homebuyers in MA would be hit hard by the #GOPTaxPlan, which would eliminate the mortgage interest deduction above $500k36 million middle class working families will see tax increases under the #GOPTaxPlanThe #GOPTaxPlan hurts middle-class families in MA by repealing state and local tax deduction, which is claimed by 1/3 MA residentsIt is time for Congress to take action and pass common-sense gun legislation. These tragedies are preventable. We must do our jobs and protect American lives.No single law will prevent gun violence, but we owe it to victims and their families to act. Common-sense gun control legislation will make Americans safer.There was another tragic shooting yesterday. As we pray for the victims and their families, we must adopt common-sense gun laws to stop this violence.Met today with the FAA to discuss aircraft noise in residential areas. It is imperative that we understand and remedy the impacts to public health and quality of life caused by aircraft flying over communities. https://t.co/QewGZ6NKd5This week I introduced a bill that would suspend construction of natural gas facilities in communities with unsafe air pollutant levels.
