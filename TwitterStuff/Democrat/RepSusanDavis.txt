I voted NO with 300 of my colleagues on the GOP immigration bill which would waste taxpayer dollars on building a wall and would not reunite separated families or provide real solutions for #Dreamers.

https://t.co/NUrIl8CIKuThe future of our democracy is on the line in the appointment of the next Supreme Court justice. As Leader McConnell has stated: “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.” We have the benefit of an election in 132 days.Disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision. As a former school board member, I saw firsthand that everyone who is represented in their workplace by a negotiating process enjoys the benefits of union leadership. #JANUSvsAFSCME 

https://t.co/l5zghexL2pThe Supreme Court failed the American people today. We look to our courts to uphold our constitution and the ideal of equality. No one should be treated differently based on their country of origin. #NoMuslimBanEver

Great questions! We talked mostly about how Congress really works, how young people can make a difference and about current border issues. https://t.co/Wor4HALsQ8When we should be reuniting children separated from their families, the GOP immigration bills spend billions of dollars on a wall &amp; don't protect Dreamers or asylum-seeking families. Voting NO on both bills. Speaker Ryan needs to work on a bipartisan &amp; humane immigration bill.Since thousands of children are still detained and separated from their families, the Administration owes it to the American people to tell us exactly how and when they plan to reunite them. #KeepFamliesTogether 

https://t.co/1hIRg28ktoIn a time when our refugee and immigrant communities are under attack by this administration, we have to remember that they are here contributing to the fabric of our country and to the economic stability of our nation. I stand #WithRefugees. https://t.co/vD9YCRtP4dSince this administration refuses to treat families humanely, Congress must step up and do the right thing. I am cosponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct in the House which would prevent migrant families from being ripped apart.While we celebrate #Juneteenth, marking the end of slavery in America, the struggle for equality and justice continues. We will not relent in our work to preserve and protect freedom. https://t.co/zisfI5FnswJoined my colleagues in inspecting facilities holding migrant children in the San Diego region &amp; repeated my demand that the Trump Administration stop separating families. America should have a zero tolerance policy for the immoral treatment of children. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/uMNutc9yabEPA Chief Scott Pruitt's distaste for environmental safeguards seems to only be surpassed by his lack of moral integrity.

Congress needs to overturn the FCC's ruling which lets Internet Service Providers decide what websites you can access and whether they want to charge you more for that access. https://t.co/WDozXIWZzXI pressed Secretary DeVos on whether she is committing enough resources to protect teachers in this program. I will be following up with the Department of Education to make sure it is keeping its promise to these teachers.

https://t.co/fsIJKPmfbwHHS needs to look at their policies and make sure they are doing all they can to keep children safe. This administration also needs to stop the inhumane practice of separating families at the border. We need to protect families, not separate them.

https://t.co/A4tUpPkMc0@SUHSD @Zer0C00LQ Good news! Thanks so much for rectifying this.Tax cuts don't pay for themselves. The GOP/Trump Tax Scheme is projected to create deficits that will hit $1 trillion. The Bush tax cuts, which I also opposed, turned a budget surplus into massive deficits. How is this fiscal responsibility?

https://t.co/TYHvUYclIJ#MemorialDay https://t.co/WXgPaMbiIK@SUHSD @Zer0C00LQ Thanks for looking into this, @SUHSD.

https://t.co/Heq0iBCGTdThank you for your thoughtful suggested questions for Secretary DeVos! I wish I could have asked them all but I will submit them to her to answer for the record. I focused on getting justice for students who have been defrauded by predatory for-profit schools.After almost 2 years in office, Secretary DeVos will appear before the Ed &amp; Workforce Comm tomorrow. What would you like me to ask her? Can't promise I'll use your question as I'll only have 5 min but will do my best to get real answers about the direction of our public schools. https://t.co/U3TiuuuZrUThe partisan #FarmBill did not reflect the priorities of the American people. It represented the priorities of the extreme elements of the Republican party, who killed their own bill because of their demand for a vote on an inhumane anti-immigration bill.

https://t.co/XiHEJrQnz5I call on the Speaker to bring to the floor a range of protections for our citizens.My profound sadness and support goes out to the loved ones of yet another unspeakable tragedy. We have enough experience to move forward and deal with this honestly. We can and we must stop gun violence through our laws and community services.Had the distinct honor of recognizing the incredible achievements of Chief Kristina Koch-the Navy honoree for the Women's Memorial Wreath Laying Ceremony. The event recognizes female servicemembers past &amp; present, esp those women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. https://t.co/Bum0xD6fXCVoting NO on the GOP’s partisan #FarmBill.

#GunReformNowThis is no hoax. With gripping detail, the Mueller indictments show how Russians infiltrated our elections with millions of dollars and an expansive operation.  What does the Congress do in response?Since Sandy Hook, more than 430 people have been killed in 230 school shootings. Congress has a responsibility to act. As a senior Member of the Education Committee, I am calling for hearings on this issue now.
