The story of America is of addition, not subtraction. It‚Äôs multiplication, not division. And when we were imperfect, we marched and built more freedom for more people. Let‚Äôs not go back now. That means #FamiliesBelongTogetherScary. A constituent just confronted me and told me I support open borders. I told her that‚Äôs not true and I‚Äôve never said that. She said ‚Äú@FoxNews said you do.‚Äù Guys, this is what we are up against. We aren‚Äôt battling ideology. We‚Äôre battling misinformation.Let‚Äôs all do our part to make sure our friends ‚Äî esp the next generation ‚Äî know that when it comes to #SCOTUS and the issues we care about, the gear box also has a reverse function. In less than a year, we could see a woman LOSE her right to make her own health care decisions.Rest In Peace, John. You saw some pretty good ball watching the @umterps as a student and covering them as a reporter. Our Terps family will miss you. #AnnapolisShooting https://t.co/hXkJyxexIlWe lost five innocent souls today at #CapitalGazette to yet another mass shooting. May they Rest In Peace. And may WE never stop doing all we can to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of dangerous people. #SpeakUpShowUpChangeRussia attacked us and our president is firmly on their side. If that‚Äôs ok, we should be silent. If it‚Äôs not, we must get louder. #SpeakUpShowUpChange https://t.co/tGDdgOiwoYToday, a country conceived to protect religious freedom allowed a #MuslimBan. Two thoughts: 1) we can‚Äôt count on the courts to always protect us; and 2) we aren‚Äôt helpless ‚Äî the right Congress can stop this wrecking ball presidency.Congress must act now to reverse the @FCC‚Äôs repeal of #NetNeutrality. Let's protect a level playing field online for small businesses and consumers. #SaveTheInternetI‚Äôm no fan of Strzok, but at least he is voluntarily coming in. And we didn‚Äôt even have to give him the questions ahead of time. https://t.co/klxQImUBw1Every day Trump makes me angrier but also more determined. I‚Äôm inspired by Dr. King, who said, ‚ÄúLet us march on ballot boxes until every valley shall be exalted, till every mountain and hill shall be made low, until the rough places are made plain and the crooked places straight.@cehoskinson Man, you‚Äôve got issues. ‚ÄúSob story.‚Äù  These are people. Children of God. Do me a favor, visit 10 churches/synagogues/mosques this week. Tell me how many priests, rabbis, or imams share your cold, cruel view of immigrants. I pray for you.@cehoskinson Nah. I have faith in Americans. We can walk and chew gum. But you‚Äôre right, maybe divert the $1.5 trillion tax cut where 83% of benefits went to the richest among us and solve this crisis. Now we are on the same page!@cehoskinson Great question ‚Äî except for your open borders BS. I support foreign aid to make sure we fight cartels where this is happening and help spur economic opportunity to people can make the best for themselves in the countries where they were born.I spent years prosecuting the worst gang members and sending them to prison. Today, my brothers protect our communities as cops. I‚Äôm done listening to lectures from people like @GovMikeHuckabee who have NEVER gotten their hands dirty. 99% of immigrants just want a better life.I just chatted w/ a Republican in #Oklahoma. He told me he‚Äôs a gun owner that believes in background checks &amp; said he agrees on 90% of what I want on immigration reform. Oh, and he thinks @realDonaldTrump is despicable. There‚Äôs more like him. Let‚Äôs #unite and reshape America.I was told I need more followers https://t.co/HvgdsLDDqsWhat would Jim Jeffords do? https://t.co/BSbSj8cPVCTo scrub this racist shit from America we have to be louder. https://t.co/uh7PW69st5In Trump‚Äôs America, to the North #Flint is still without drinking water and to South mothers have had their babies ripped from their arms. There‚Äôs no art in this raw deal. Just pain. North. South. And everywhere in between. Let‚Äôs take care of each other. Now more than ever.Kids have been taken from their parents and living in kennels, yet @HouseJudiciary just set ANOTHER hearing next week on @HillaryClinton‚Äôs emails. That‚Äôs just sick. Like seriously, who the F does that? #FamiliesBelongTogetherIt‚Äôs not helping working people. I‚Äôm all for making businesses more competitive. But if the CEO is going to get a raise because the company is doing better, so should the janitor. And everyone else. That didn‚Äôt happen. https://t.co/I6wjZJJLWRI‚Äôm not anxious at all for the future. These students are going to help shape it. And that‚Äôs a good thing. #RoadToChange https://t.co/ZxQEHAaYlZAs ugly as @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs policy of separating kids from their parents was, I‚Äôm inspired by how many of us came together ‚Äî both parties &amp; people who don‚Äôt follow politics ‚Äî to show compassion, make calls, and send aid. There are challenging days and we‚Äôll need more of this.You, and you alone, have made sadness and grief a cornerstone of U.S. policy, to our nation's shame. First with DACA &amp; now with taking children from parents, you've held lives for ransom - the acts of a heartless con man. https://t.co/iomMvjPFHMStop gaslighting America. Democrats care about security and humanity; you care about your headlines. The Goodlatte bill failed because 41 @HouseGOP members opposed it. If we were allowed to vote on the DREAM Act, it would pass. https://t.co/4bWJZZk6YBOn @FoxNews @cavuto asked if @realDonaldTrump wanted to see kids suffer. How did he not? It was HIS policy to separate them from their parents. HIS policy to put them in cages. And HIS choice to say he couldn‚Äôt do anything (days before he did). That‚Äôs cruel, cold, and con-like.This ugly chapter in American history is not closed. There are 2,000+ children separated from their parents. @DHSgov must reunite them NOW. #ReuniteFamiliesAs @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SpeakerRyan do high-fives about the #GOPTaxScam‚Äôs 6-month anniversary, remember that it gave big cuts to the rich &amp; table scraps to working families and the poor. How about REAL #TaxReform? https://t.co/i7mvO4sfvFWe DON‚ÄôT need a bill to #KeepFamiliesTogether. @realDonaldTrump, you can call @CBP right now. I‚Äôll even share the number: 877-227-5511. Make the call.The @HouseGOP stood up to @realDonaldTrump alright. Stood up and applauded a man who is snatching kids from parents and caging them. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/LlCrNHsUt3Hey @HouseGOP, listen to America. With kids in cages, @HouseJudiciary held a hearing on Hillary's emails. This committee can force Trump to #KeepFamiliesTogether. I urged my colleagues to call their offices, check their emails &amp; read their Twitter. Watch: https://t.co/8dW8HO7byO@debrajsaunders I do! Welcome to the Article I side of government, Debra! üëãüèºOur President is lying to us. He is separating children from their parents and caging them. This is not normal. And say it EVERY DAY until that changes. #KeepFamilesTogetherIs @realDonaldTrump weak or cruel? Mr. President, if you want to #keepfamiliestogether, are you too weak to use your own power to change your Administration‚Äôs policy? Or, are you too cruel?Congress is back in session tomorrow and @HouseJudiciary Republicans are holding a hearing on ‚Äî I‚Äôm not kidding you ‚Äî @HillaryClinton‚Äôs emails. We shouldn‚Äôt do anything else until we #KeepFamilesTogether.Stone &amp; Caputo both sat through HOURS of testimony strictly related to Russia. They knew they‚Äôd be asked about Russian contacts. They didn‚Äôt forget. They lied. Why? Because they wanted to work with Russians. It‚Äôs that easy. https://t.co/JrE7KjFMuIShe knows we can check this, right? Here‚Äôs the deal: deputies follow the principal. If the principal lies and thinks he can get away with it, so will the deputies. #BREAKING you‚Äôre not getting away with it any longer. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/zI7zZnBJ7AThere‚Äôs no ‚Äúboth sides.‚Äù Every Democrat in Congress opposes separating children from their families. Yet, @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP let them suffer. #FamilesBelongTogetherThe best part of #fathersday2018 has been spending every second with my son. No parent who comes to America should be separated from their child. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWishing a #HappyFathersDay to all the dads out there. The best gift my dad gave me was his deep love and showing me the value of hard work. He believed if he worked hard for me and my brothers, we‚Äôd all do better. Let‚Äôs make sure that‚Äôs always true in America.Let‚Äôs not call @realDonaldTrump delusional or out of his mind. He knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing. He‚Äôs scamming Americans.There it is. @realDonaldTrump just admitted he dictated a false statement for his son on the Trump Tower meeting. They. Are. All. Lies. #TrumpRussiaDO NOT SALUTE https://t.co/f8b1ssO5dJRepping the Tri-Valley Babe Ruth baseball team at tonight‚Äôs #CongressionalBaseballGame! https://t.co/crk6SdzF6MThis should never happen in America.

We are not helpless!America‚Äôs president is supposed to be a leader of the world, not a publicist to a dictator. What have we gotten from #KoreanSummit?@realDonaldTrump should check his back pocket ‚Äî his wallet may be in North Korea.Two years ago today, a man with a military-style semi-automatic assault weapon massacred 49 people at the #Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Many massacres later, we're still waiting for meaningful action on #gunviolence. #EnoughIsEnough #HonorThemWithActionIf only @BarackObama had negotiated a deal to denuclearize an enemy of America that had weapons pointed at us and our allies. 

Wait. What? He did? 

I hope #NorthKoreaSummit ends North Korea‚Äôs nukes. If not, it‚Äôs the biggest American foreign policy failure. Ever.Let @realDonaldTrump and Kim Jung Un bro out all they like. I welcome @BarackObama‚Äôs idea of engaging our enemies. But if this doesn‚Äôt lead to denuclearization, it‚Äôs a colossal waste of time and will cause irreparable harm to America‚Äôs reputation.I don‚Äôt think most @NRA members would be cool with their leadership cozying up with an enemy of America. Is Trump really worth sacrificing everything we hold dear? Hell no. https://t.co/1qwS23hzifKeep the internet open and free. #NetNeutralty https://t.co/1dWEiDa0IwI‚Äôm old enough to remember when our leaders worked for years, w/ lots of...what‚Äôs that word...preparation?...to strike a nuclear agreement to disarm Iran.

Should we buy-back &amp; ban assault weapons to keep kids safe?You know who talks like this? You know who else thinks the law doesn‚Äôt apply to them? You know who else takes the 5th? The Mob. 

Mr. Mayor, you used to prosecute people like this. Now you‚Äôre leading them. https://t.co/raEMpv5hJ5Just met with brave #ElDorado high school students who marched on Washington for their lives and promised to march to the ballot boxes for change. #NeverAgain #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/tpePqhzBT6@dangainor Don‚Äôt be so dramatic.Must see üëáüèº https://t.co/Y9cEQGFwoAMy heart is with #Hawaii.

#EnoughIsEnough@Uncle_Jimbo Jim, have you ever qualified as a ballistics expert in a court of law? When? Where?@Uncle_Jimbo This victim was only hit in the back of his leg. It killed him ‚Äúpretty well.‚Äù@Uncle_Jimbo Respectfully, sir, you should take that up with the ballistics expert and pathologist who testified in the referenced case.I‚Äôve heard some thoughtful feedback that instead of doing a buy-back program for assault weapons we should invest more in community violence programs. Let‚Äôs do both. I no longer accept two things: that assault weapons are 2A covered or we have limited choices to end gun deaths.Sorry, James, saving lives doesn‚Äôt have to be that dramatic. Here‚Äôs the idea:

If you:

1) Have criminal record ‚û°Ô∏è no gun

2) Have a weapon of war ‚û°Ô∏è we‚Äôll buy it or you keep it at a range

#EndGunViolence #EnoughisEnough https://t.co/VRcY32CbhWStudents across America are teaching us their right to live is supreme to any other right. It‚Äôs time to buy-back and ban weapons of war. Here‚Äôs how: 

https://t.co/rhjzBluBEBThis is ridiculous. No person should have to experience this. The only way to end discrimination like this is to better teach our kids, be honest about implicit bias, diversify workplaces, and do all we can to extend opportunity to everyone, everywhere. https://t.co/VfH53NtIwT#ProbablyLiesYou‚Äôve got it all backwards. It‚Äôs because you have all these important responsibilities that we are concerned what the Russians have on you. https://t.co/IVkL0nGSQzAs #TrumpRussia investigation nears completion, it‚Äôs time for @realDonaldTrump to come clean. It‚Äôs quite binary. Either he can answer questions about whether he worked w/ Russia or he can‚Äôt. And if he can‚Äôt, we‚Äôll assume what he assumes about someone who takes the 5th. He did it.The @HouseGOP is seeking to fire Mueller‚Äôs boss. This is NOT a drill. These guys will do anything to torch the rule of law in America to protect @realDonaldTrump. Are there more of us than them?It‚Äôs #MayDay2018 ‚Äî an international celebration of workers. US workers are working harder than ever but have less and less to show for it. You work hard. That should mean you can keep your job, getting sick doesn‚Äôt wipe you out, &amp; your kids have a career they‚Äôre prepared for.Wait. So he‚Äôs not the picture of perfect health?

U.S. workers &amp; families deserve better than this #GOPTaxScam.There‚Äôs only two possible scenarios here: (1) John Kelly said his boss, @realDonaldTrump, is an idiot; or (2) two people close to John Kelly are conspiring to make it look like John Kelly said this.

Lots of news outlets reporting it was because objections that our chaplain expressed in his prayers that we should look out for least among us. Paul Ryan should tell us why.But those who did see an increase, really saw an increase. That‚Äôs the problem. People are working harder, but only those on the top floor of their buildings are doing better.

Troops deserve a plan. Not impulse. https://t.co/Ru57pue3DQLast year, @realDonaldTrump struck #Syria (w/o congressional approval). What‚Äôs changed? Zero. They‚Äôre still using chemical weapons. This is the result of a failure to have a strategy and engage Middle East countries to solve this problem.We cannot allow #Syria‚Äôs use of chemical weapons. We also cannot allow an unhinged (or hinged) President to unilaterally take America to war. We can stop both. Go to Congress, @realDonaldTrump. Tell us length of time, # of troops, and terrain covered. Americans deserve a voice.Another rough day for our country. But I have faith in our future.
