To my colleagues-Democrat or Republican-that care about reproductive, LGBTQ or voting rights, I urge you to fight for a Supreme Court Justice that won’t turn the clock back in this nation. Fight to keep the progress we have made toward a more equal America intact.As Putin &amp; his puppet Assad commit atrocities against Syrian civilians, it’s important to look at the facts behind Assad’s use of chemical weapons.

Please stop calling them the enemy. https://t.co/xC0JBWVZnwReports that first responders arrived in one minute. Thank God for them.  Thanks to all of our first responders for their work every day.Yes we’re going to talk about gun violence. Now. Because there was just another mass shooting. Now is the time to talk about all the ways we can do something to save lives.So sorry for the tragic loss of life. Thinking about all lives lost and praying for their families and all the injured.Reporters travel to dangerous conflict zones to do their important work. The newsroom shouldn’t be one of them. Horrible news.Just saw news that five have been killed. Others gravely injuredIt is now confirmed that there have been multiple casualties and injuries. The shooting took place in the newspapers newsroom.My Republican colleague told Rosenstein to “finish [Mueller’s] investigation the hell up.”

We stand with those striving for political &amp; economic freedom. 

#IranProtestsMcConnell stole Obama’s @Scotus seat and gave it to Trump. Now our country’s highest court could be tilted in favor of special interests over the American people. Reproductive, LGBT, and voting rights are at serious risk. Our slow progress toward equality could now be undone.There are 147 fake women’s health centers in FL. 5 men on @SCOTUS used the First Amendment to protect their lies. Anti-Choice activists impersonate doctors &amp; falsely tell women that abortion makes it 400x more likely they’ll get breast cancer. We must #EndTheLies
 
#NIFLAvBecerraThe GOP wants to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to balance the budget. I don’t recall the GOP being concerned with frugality when they gave their rich friends a 1.5 trillion-dollar tax break. Don’t use seniors to fix your mistake. They deserve better. #GOPTaxScamI guess he forgot about the time when he thought Russia’s interference in our elections was an “act of war.”

https://t.co/Q21dV0ZqavThe brutal Assad regime &amp; his Russian backers again targeted Syrian hospitals, yet John Bolton used the Kremlin’s warm welcome to praise Putin’s hosting the World Cup.

@realDonaldTrump, don’t try to bully your way into a ridiculous wall. Show you are serious about getting something done.“Supreme Court Upholds Trump Travel Ban”

Don’t judge Trump’s Muslim Ban by whether it is Constitutional. 

Judge it by whether it is right. 

It’s not. 

So stand up for religious liberty. And stand up for America.

#NoMuslimBanWe need comprehensive immigration reform that makes our system work. To do this, we need to work across the aisle and lift our shared values above the fears that divide us.

Great to share the stage with @repedroyce @repgallagher @senrisch https://t.co/q7beKRDAq0.@realdonaldtrump has shown he doesn’t truly care about finding compromise. 

He only cares about appearing “tough.” 

The Goodlatte immigration bill reflects that agenda. 

No pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, ends diversity visas, and funds Trump’s ridiculous wall.“Hot-button social controversy” and “political calamity” are not how I would frame a humanitarian disaster and betrayal of our values. 

https://t.co/Z4zStE481OAnd this is NOT OK. 

Make special efforts. Work around the clock. Do everything you can. If you claim you’re ending this horrific policy, then end it. 

You took these kids from their parents. You should return them to their parents. 

#FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/EYpwFyuMjjNo country should endure these attacks. Hamas terror threatens Israel and it makes life worse for the people of Gaza.

I want to ask how you can defend this cruel policy and tell you about my constituents who are demanding you end it. #KeepFamiliesTogetherI issued this statement following reports that President Trump will withdraw the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council: https://t.co/qa9OEqDJoe.@realdonaldtrump will meet with Republicans today to gain support for separating children from their families. 

I hope some can reach into their soul &amp; summon courage to tell him to end this cruel, callous policy. 

Their silence will mean complicity.

#FamiliesBelongTogetherThese are the voices of the kids that are being detained. They aren’t criminals. They are scared. We need to stand up for these children and stop this atrocity from continuing. 

https://t.co/pS8Armt5AcMore chairs = more voters. https://t.co/WqyEBOQ2SCThat’s right, Bill. This immoral policy is unacceptable to most Americans, Laura Bush included. And @realDonaldTrump should end it now. https://t.co/S77tl9Q5ydLocking children up in detention centers is un-American.  

@realdonaldtrump you claim you aren’t a politician, yet you play politics with lives of young children and their parents. This is inhumane and the American people are DEMANDING you END THIS.

#FamiliesBelongTogetherHe makes the best deals. And he uses trauma inflicted on young children to make them. 

Beyond infuriating.WaPo: President Trump has calculated that he will gain political leverage in congressional negotiations by continuing to enforce a policy he claims to hate — separating immigrant parents from their young children at the southern border, according to White House officials.Each day this continues is a day you decide to continue it, @SpeakerRyan

That we haven’t voted to stop Trump from separating children &amp; making them feel like animals in cages is disgusting. 

This is an emergency for those kids &amp; crisis for our values. Let’s vote to stop it. NOW https://t.co/kBvMyDLcTZSince we made it to Friday &amp; Trump has still failed to #FirePruitt , I offer my next verse to @RepAdamSchiff’s excellent Favorite Things:

Let’s be clear about something-our current immigration crisis isn’t about Democrats.
 
The kids in detention centers and families torn apart is about...

1 @realdonaldtrump in the White House.A nation that is committed to moral integrity doesn’t place children—alone—in detainment centers that are described as jails.

A nation that is committed to family values doesn’t go out of its way to rip children from the arms of their parents.

@realdonaldtrump this must end.If you think you don’t have to say that it was shameful and disgusting for @SteveKingIA to retweet a Nazi sympathizer, you would be wrong. 

We should all be saying it.

Especially @SpeakerRyan.

@realDonaldTrump, I’m calling on you AGAIN to #DrainTheSwamp and #FirePruitt.Just checked, Ag Commissioner Putnam’s massive background check failure still not on Gov. Scott’s cabinet meeting agenda for 9am today. 

Gov Scott expects “everybody to be held accountable.” But he doesn’t plan to bring it up? Or ask why Putnam didn’t share IG report with him? https://t.co/DBlI0vRdU2The UK did the right thing.

The President views him as a “talented man.” What happened to our values?Before the President goes too far with his “trust” of this “talented man” who “loves his country very much,” let’s remember that this is a grotesque violator of the human rights of his own people. And he wrongfully imprisons Americans. Let’s not forget that.POTUS agreed to stop military exercises with South Korea, calling them provocative “war games” – the favored language of North Korea. South Korea apparently surprised. After alienating allies at the G7, US should be reaffirming commitment to security of our allies in region.Diplomacy is clearly a better path than military action. Pursuit of denuclearization requires detailed technical verification and close consultation with our allies. On that the President was silent.Disturbing when POTUS sounds more like the guy who attacked our democracy than our closest allies.
 
Trump’s deal breaking is pushing away our allies &amp; asking Russia back to the table is setting up G6+2 w/ America on the wrong side of the equation. https://t.co/zESpJRqdliWe need to make mental health in schools a priority.

Congrats to the #Classof2018!We need answers. We need to know what Governor Scott and Commissioner Putnam knew and when they knew it. If there is any evidence that they attempted to shield this report from the people of Florida it would be the highest order of corruption. https://t.co/4BgEdCCMGK@FLGovScott: “Our office was not provided this report.”

Governor meets with his cabinet at least once a month. Ag Commissioner learned about this a year ago. 

He didn’t think to mention this terrible screw-up to the Governor? That lives may have been at risk in our state? https://t.co/Agb5pfOysXAren’t NICS background checks completed for every concealed weapons permit app to check for disqualifying offenses?

If there were 200,000 applications, why follow up on only 365 and disqualify 291?  If there is an explanation, Putnam owes it to us. 

He owed it to us a year ago. https://t.co/4BgEdCCMGKPutnam now says he launched an investigation and put in safeguards to ensure this doesn’t happen again. 

He should release all information related to that investigation and all measures put in place as a result.

A judge needing to order this shows, once again, that Pruitt isn’t qualified to head the EPA. That’s why I have called on @POTUS to #FirePruittThis administration is “the swamp.”

Coal tycoon Robert Murray essentially dictated executive orders to the @realdonaldtrump admin on policies that benefited his business interests. This President isn’t a champion against lobbyists, he is their biggest ally.

The science is undeniable. Climate change is affecting Americans across the country. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. 

https://t.co/ZEmj72l2XAWe should all be outraged. With so many lives lost in school mass shootings, creating “games” that allow you to “play” a school shooter is horrific  and disgusting.  Please show some respect and decency. 

https://t.co/OfG26XcPJzWhen you are the President of the United States, peddling conspiracy theories is extremely dangerous.

@SpeakerRyan, you’ve had 3 months since our meeting to ready universal background checks for the floor. 

How many more?Another piece of our heart was torn out of us this morning.  To the grieving families and survivors, please know that all of us South Florida are here for you. Just like the families and communities of Columbine and Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook and Dunblane have been with us.It’s been three months since the shooting at Stoneman Douglas. If you are watching this, it should move you to tears. More important, if you’re an elected official, it should move you to action to keep kids safe. And if it doesn’t, then just get the hell out of our way.I’m watching kids on TV. They’re standing outside their high school. And they’re crying because they survived a school shooting. It is so familiar and so horrifying. I’m so sad and so, so angry.There is an active shooter at a high school in Texas. We are following the story closely. And we are sad, disgusted, and outraged to have to say that—again.I'm deeply alarmed by the @RonanFarrow @NewYorker story of missing suspicious activity reports (SARs) on Michael Cohen from a Treasury Dept. database.

This should alarm every American, but especially those who think the NRA stands for their rights.It is infrastructure week and @realdonaldtrump is nowhere to be found with the $1.5 trillion he promised for infrastructure spending. 

As roads and bridges crumble, the @GOP and POTUS do nothing..@realdonaldtrump reportedly plans to use the one-year anniversary of the special counsel to try to end the probe.

This attempt will fail, and outside interference must not stand in the way of this investigation. 

Justice does not run on the President’s schedule.The US previously punished China’s telecom giant ZTE for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea, and our intel agencies have warned ZTE is a natl security risk.

So why is @realDonaldTrump is working to protect sanctions-violator ZTE?

#EndGunViolence #SurvivorStrong https://t.co/nqrUZdbjRPTo recap: After bipartisan concerns re Dr. Ronny Jackson’s lack of experience, allegations of a demeaning management style, troubling Rx practices &amp; drunkenness during work hours, President Trump responded by questioning the patriotism of Senators?

Our veterans deserve better.FEDERAL JUDGE: Trump Admin must continue to accept new and renewed DACA applications. 

DREAMers aren’t illegal.

Instead of letting Trump continue to fight in court to find a way to bring chaos and fear to 700,000 young people, let’s pass the #DREAMActNowCongrats to @RosLehtinen on her lifetime achievement award! I’m proud to call her my friend and proud of the work we have done together with the amazing @EDCoalition advocates for #EatingDisordersAwareness from FL and around the country. 

#EDCHillDay https://t.co/sUqvkJYoGAThe @NRA raised $2.4 million in March to support candidates who block common-sense gun laws. 

Oh, also, the “All-American” NRA takes Russian money, so I’m asking @WaysandMeansGOP and @GOPoversight to review dark money &amp; foreign contributions the NRA may have used to sway voters. https://t.co/wOx1MsTK25On Feb. 14th, 17 students &amp; teachers were killed in another senseless act of gun violence. 

In March, the @NRA posted its best fundraising month in 15 years. 

The NRA is NOT a civil rights organization; it’s a fundraiser for gun manufacturers trying to protect their interests.A weapon of war should never be in the hands of a civilian. Luckily, James Shaw Jr. was courageous enough to stare down the threat of death and save lives. 

He deserves praise for his bravery and the American people deserve safety.

https://t.co/boHCjcJ9FiI am praying for everyone hurt and killed in Toronto during this horrific incident. 

I send my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and I am pulling for everyone currently hospitalized. 

We are here for #Toronto and all our friends in #Canada.Dark money groups can hide their donors bc they think the FEC won’t enforce disclosure rules. The FEC blocked @CREWcrew’s complaint, so now they are taking their case to federal court. 

@NoahBookbinder explains in this thread. 

#GetMoneyOut https://t.co/IoCXfPxCtg.@nytimes @mega2e @jodikantor @NewYorker &amp; @RonanFarrow just won #Pulitzer for unflinching reporting on sex abuse &amp; harassment. Their work fueled change through #MeToo movement.
 
But guess what: Senate is blocking reforms to hold Congress accountable. Passed House 2/6. #TimesUpFollowing the latest deadly mass shooting - this time at a Waffle House - we cannot allow the NRA to continue to block meaningful action on gun violence. I'm calling on Congress to investigate whether the NRA is illegally using foreign donations in its political activity. https://t.co/HhJ9LLR1bV#climatechange isn’t partisan; it’s a reality. But it’s not too late. On #EarthDay2018 I call on both Democrats and Republicans to come together and respond to the growing threat of climate change.

We have one Earth. Let’s not waste it  #EarthDay2018Thank you to @YoYo_Ma @KenCenPrez Deborah Rutter, and @KenCen Chairman David Rubenstein for highlighting #ArtsAcrossAmerica and right here in Fort Lauderdale. https://t.co/ALDYum9iP3My thoughts and prayers are with victims &amp; families in Nashville, but thoughts and prayers are not enough. 

@SpeakerRyan, are you scheduling a moment of silence this week? As we reflect on lives lost, let’s DO SOMETHING. Let’s vote on common-sense gun laws THIS WEEK. #NeverAgainEvery day Americans are killed by guns. This time in a Nashville restaurant. 

@SpeakerRyan, over 90% of Americans support fixing our background check system. 

It’s time to hold the votes. It’s time to take action. 

It’s not too soon. It’s too late. 

#EndGunViolence https://t.co/55rUop5JKtCongress must investigate whether the @NRA illegally used foreign donations to fund its political activity. According to reports, the FEC &amp; FBI are already investigating. Congress must break free from the NRA's grip &amp; stop the gun lobby from preventing action on gun violence. https://t.co/u3NdqQGLg8The @NRA is a shining example of how money is corrupting our democracy and endangering our citizens. Watch this @voxdotcom video to learn why. 👇

https://t.co/idw5eTmozWToday marks 19 years since the Columbine HS massacre. In roughly the time since, the @NRA has spent $203.2 million on political activities to stop a gun safety debate this country desperately needs. Congress cannot sit by while gun corporations use their profits to deny #gunsenseThe @NRA has always mislabeled gun reform efforts as freedom versus tyranny. 

That's nonsense! https://t.co/mvU1HNzPYrSchool walkouts in Marion County over school shootings have been canceled because of a school shooting...

https://t.co/dSpumvhiV519 years have passed since the horrific shooting at Columbine. 

Since then, there have been 85 school shootings, 223 teachers, staff, and students tragically killed, and 206,000 students exposed to gun violence. 

I pray for the 13 lost at Columbine. They won’t be forgotten. https://t.co/AVSHL1xpVg“The largest NIH funding commitment in two decades aimed at reducing gun deaths, the second leading cause of fatalities in children.”

The consortium will work from @UMich. #GoBlue https://t.co/OzzMqvzwh470 years ago, Israel declared its independence and created the modern Jewish state. 70 years later, Israel has flourished into a country full of energy &amp; determination, and has defied its opponents to create a thriving, prosperous, innovative democracy. #israel70 #YomHaatzmaut.@BarackObama is right when he says our youth activists have “the power to insist that America can be better.” 

Today they are the authors of America’s future-and I am certain that someday, their legacies will be a source of pride in America’s history. 

https://t.co/kXGyji8Nl7Today, I was honored to join Max Schachter, Ryan Petty, @SenBillNelson and @marcorubio for the National School Safety Ideas Forum. Two months after the Stoneman Douglas tragedy, Congress must follow our conversations with action and pass laws that keep our schools safe. https://t.co/zLrzcYAbZhMore than half of teens surveyed ages 13 to 17 — 57 percent — worry about a school shooting. A quarter of that group said they are very worried 

Our kids deserve to learn without fear of being hurt or killed. They deserve safe schools. They deserve more. 
https://t.co/Yxv3weuElF.@EPAScottPruitt is currently under at least SEVEN separate independent federal investigations. He needs to be held accountable for his failures at @EPA – that is why I am calling for his immediate resignation. #BootPruitt https://t.co/8uDA5STkb2.@SenateMajLdr McConnell refusing to put a bill to #ProtectMueller on the Senate floor is inviting a Constitutional Crisis.

@realdonaldtrump cannot be allowed to stop Mueller’s investigation and safeguards must be implemented.For 70 years, Israelis have had to defend their country from enemies aiming to destroy its very existence. On Yom HaZikaron, Israel's Memorial Day, we remember those dedicated Israeli men and women who gave their lives to defend the Jewish state. #Israel.@ForeignPolicy map shows the extent to which @realDonaldTrump hasn’t upheld his administration’s responsibilities in ensuring strong U.S. foreign policy. We can’t combat growing Russian &amp; Iranian influence without strong foreign policy leadership. 
https://t.co/Em67Gd7iaH.@realdonaldtrump WH official claimed Amb. Haley was confused about Russian sanctions. 

Her response: “I don’t get confused.”

I believe her. But Americans &amp; our allies are confused by the public disagreements.

This WH needs a clear &amp; unified message on Russia. #TrumpRussiaIt was a pleasure meeting with @WhitfordBradley and @JayButera yesterday on behalf of @citizensclimate to discuss climate change solutions. https://t.co/j9VN3mpvLFKalashnikov USA, the assault weapons producer based in Pompano, may be violating federal laws by importing gun parts from and sharing profits with a sanctioned Russian company. I'm asking the Treasury Department to investigate this thoroughly. https://t.co/F5JGt3OEPOFor 70 years, Israelis have had to defend their country from many enemies looking to destroy its very existence. On Yom Hazikaron, Israel's Memorial Day, we mourn and reflect on those dedicated Israeli men and women who gave their lives to defend the Jewish state.Barbara Bush understood the deep importance of public service and instilled in her children the fundamental principle that those who serve put country before self. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Bush family on their loss.Honored to meet Joe Samaha &amp; Paul Friedman of @VTVFOFoundation. 

Joe lost his daughter at Virginia Tech 11 years ago. 

Thank you for your leadership, strength &amp; compassion for others who have suffered extraordinary loss. Your work glorifies the memory of Reema. #VTWeRemember https://t.co/39GeoqScFaThis Congress has been in desperate need of bipartisan cooperation to protect the Mueller investigation, the rule of law, and the search for truth. 

@SenateMajLdr shouldn't get in the way of it. https://t.co/49qjlVe5HdThe #GOPTaxScam makes clear that once the speeches are over and cameras turned off, the middle class isn’t a priority for the GOP.

As Republicans celebrate their tax cuts for corporate America, the middle class wonders why it’s being left behind. #TaxDayBut seriously, get smart. This is wasteful, possibly used for improper purposes, &amp; violated the Anti-Deficiency Act—a law to stop gov officials from spending taxpayer money for unapproved purposes. 

Pruitt spent $38,000 over the limit for renovations to make his #ConeOfSilenceEXCLUSIVE: Appendix to GAO opinion finding @EPAScottPruitt’s $43,000 sound-proof phone booth violated federal law. 

#GetSmart #ConeOfSilence https://t.co/e8YxmCX0GXWhen Pres. @realDonaldTrump and his foreign policy official publicly disagree on US strategy, it creates confusion and distrust for our allies. This is a dangerous misstep. We need a clear foreign policy strategy &amp; must follow through with our commitment.
https://t.co/baSTgZl26YThe blackout in PR is the second longest in world history. 

The United States, the wealthiest country on this planet, is failing to provide for its people. Puerto Ricans are US citizens and we cannot continue to ignore their needs.

https://t.co/2WLaO3b933Kellyanne Conway: All Comey had to do was keep his mouth shut

@realdonaldtrump and his WH need to realize a few things: You can’t silence @Comey, remove Mueller to stop his investigation, or fire Rosenstein because he won't fire Mueller.

If you do-you’ll be obstructing justice.By my last count, Trump has tweeted 22 times about how bad leakers are-I guess he only likes them if they are his friends! #DrainTheSwamp #LibbyLeak

Congress standing by and refusing to act on gun safety legislation is shameful.

https://t.co/bzdPerZX23Shameful that Syria and Russia are blocking international chemical weapons inspectors from investigating the attack against innocent civilians in Eastern Ghouta.

@realdonaldtrump, the Mueller probe isn’t a "witch hunt" and if you truly respect the rule of law, then you'll let Mueller and his team do their jobs and stop undermining their investigationsI joined with @RosLehtinen @RepEliotEngel @NitaLowey to condemn these attacks on students and anti-Semitism in all its forms, and we reject any inappropriate evocation of the Holocaust or comparison to Nazis. https://t.co/kFaiQSFjaTIt is shameful for anyone to attack students – especially survivors of gun violence – with anti-Semitic slurs and Nazi comparisons. Policy differences are never an excuse for anti-Semitism. https://t.co/UFYF8FWHSp.@realDonaldTrump attacking @Comey , calling him an “untruthful slime ball” isn’t fighting back or standing tough. It is a failure to uphold the prestige of the Presidency and show restraint in the face of criticism. Reality TV stars may thrive on one-liners, but Presidents don’t
