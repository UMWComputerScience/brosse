Our letter: https://t.co/AEbGC09kyf. https://t.co/CikMSNwGOqCongress just left for another week of recess. Meanwhile, there's still thousands of children waiting to be reunited with their parents because of @realDonaldTrump's evil child separation policy.

To the Republican-controlled Congress: Have a nice vacation. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/lJHJeBRkcnOur hearts go out to the #CapitalGazette victims and their families. Congressional inaction on gun violence prevention has allowed U.S. mass shootings to continue to increase. It shouldn’t take another preventable tragedy to remind us of the grave consequences of failing to act.Questioned FBI Director Wray and Deputy AG Rosenstein today at the Judiciary Committee's “emergency” hearing – not on family separation, not on efforts to undermine the Mueller investigation, but on Hillary Clinton’s emails from 2016. Enough with the conspiracy theories! https://t.co/I6ptRIYPnUThe House Judiciary Committee questioned @FBI agent #PeterStrzok for hrs behind closed doors. GOP members now want use his testimony but refuse to hold an open hearing &amp; allow him to testify.

Release the transcripts, Chairman @RepGoodlatte. The American ppl deserve to hear this. https://t.co/CjvggrS3qzThis #ImmigrantHeritageMonth we honor the immigrants and refugees from around the world who have fled oppression, poverty, and persecution, and traveled to America in search of a better life for themselves and their families. #IStandWithImmigrants https://t.co/jBBGaKYAz3The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to block the passage of H.Res. 928, our Resolution of Inquiry that would impose proper oversight of @realDonaldTrump’s abuse of pardon power. 

We do not accept it &amp; this fight isn’t over. https://t.co/lJgVbYCHpo https://t.co/Edq2CJobN7This case was an attack on unions and an attack on working people and the causes we fight for every day. We stand with our union brothers &amp; sisters. No court case will stop our movement. #JANUSvsAFSCME https://t.co/pW4UrkdKsgShelby, Korematsu, Dred Scott, and now, Trump v. Hawaii. Today's decision joins a line of rulings history will look back on in shame. #WeWillNotBeBanned #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/bqiUm79qkPIf @realDonaldTrump issued pardons to his advisers, his children or himself, that would constitute perhaps the gravest abuse of power in U.S. history. Our resolution of inquiry would allow us to better understand the decision-making behind Trump's pardons. https://t.co/2pHQ7vINAw https://t.co/vKt91U8Ip4Despite marriage equality becoming law of the land, #LGBTQ people still risk being fired from their job or denied housing because of who they are. This is unacceptable. Congress must act now to pass the bipartisan Equality Act. #EqualityForward https://t.co/o2N8jXj3CR#RoevWade is at greater risk than ever before. The anti-choice movement is not going to give up - and neither are we. #EndTheLies #ExposeFakeClincs #NIFLAvBecerra https://t.co/mL2DBmWzW1Today the House Judiciary Committee will consider H.Res. 928, a resolution of inquiry we introduced with @BillPascrell to highlight @realDonaldTrump's dangerous abuse of pardon power. Watch LIVE here: https://t.co/9fhQtGhDmD. https://t.co/pnwASwxNFRVoting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, Americans want the full freedom to vote back. It’s time to #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/90OAubXtYRSpoke on the House Floor to speak out against @realDonaldTrump's cruel and inhumane policy of separating children from their parents at the border. Have you heard the cries of these children? Listen as they are entered into the congressional record today. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/7Ngual0bZjToday w/ @RepAnthonyBrown we sent a letter to AG Sessions urging him to withdraw his request for active duty JAGs to go to the border &amp; prosecute immigration cases. As former JAGs, we believe this proposal is unwise, inefficient, &amp; hurts our nat. security. https://t.co/bEZJAFAAz7 https://t.co/7pxWSxRKwtThe Trump Admin is doing the @HouseGOP’s bidding &amp; coming after protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. Again. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/iYPz5wUR4W.@HouseGOP held more than 20 hearings on #SNAP, at which none of the 89 witnesses recommended cutting benefits. Today, they passed a partisan, heartless #FarmBill that will cut billions in food assistance for families in need. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/68ehQL18f9When asked where the girls and toddlers are being held, @SecNielsen didn’t know. Isn’t that her job? #WhereAreTheGirls? https://t.co/Ju5n5pXyb5.@DHSgov Secretary Nielsen lied to the American people about @realDonaldTrump's cruel #FamilySeperation policy. She continues to lie &amp; refuses to apologize. Her credibly has been shredded. The time has come for @SecNielsen to resign. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/2xDFtLyfB8.@WSJ reports @NatEnquirer publisher has been subpoenaed in the #Cohen investigation. In light of this news, a reminder that @RepTedLieu &amp; @RepKathleenRice sent a letter to the @FBI back in March regarding questionable payments made by Trump's associates: https://t.co/8HGAfK8Xq4. https://t.co/EJTQK9xihJProud to stand with fellow @HouseDemocrats to reject @realDonaldTrump’s barbaric treatment of immigrant children. The practice of separating children from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane and cruel. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/rbQ6vrkYWTTune in now to hear our colleagues discuss legislation to keep families together at the border. https://t.co/51e22FI2egCongress must send a strong message that the U.S - a country whose story has been written by those fleeing oppression &amp; hardship – will not abandon the world’s most vulnerable populations. Proud introduce H.Res 395 to reaffirm our commitment to protect refugees. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/WWmHO1JDoXHere’s some much-needed good (and cute!) news coming out of #CA33 today! https://t.co/SpqQiIIETHThe Trump-driven policy of separating families at the border is inhumane, un-American, &amp; runs counter to everything our country stands for. Proud to co-lead the introduction of the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to end family separation at the border.

Trump's cowardly decision to end DACA goes against the very forces that have made America an exceptional country. Our nation’s embrace of immigrants is what makes it great, and we must do whatever we can to protect #DREAMers.Wishing happiness and peace to everyone celebrating #EidAlFitr around the world. Eid Mubarak! https://t.co/Dj2KHSXR3xU.S. support of Saudi &amp; UAE coalition in Yemen has resulted in a massive humanitarian catastrophe &amp; what look like war crimes.

It's now up to the Trump Administration to ensure #NorthKorea holds up its end of the deal. Full statement here: https://t.co/ZPEGqXRUtq.Despite overwhelming public support, the Trump @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality starts today.

It’s simple: women should be paid the same as men for the same work. We need to strengthen the #EqualPayAct by passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct. https://t.co/FiqucIledYThe Trump Administration is trying to make it legal to discriminate against Americans with pre-existing conditions. Infuriating! #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/iYPz5wUR4W https://t.co/0FRy1DolPH.@realDonaldTrump recently stated that he has the "absolute right" to pardon himself - we beg to differ. That's why w/ @BillPascrell we've introduced H.Res. 928, a Resolution of Inquiry into Trump's dangerous abuse of pardon power. More on our bill here: https://t.co/2pHQ7vINAw. https://t.co/POeSaTSsXgAround 1PM today, @RepTedLieu &amp; @RepRubenGallego will be leading a Special Order Hour to highlight some more of @EPAScottPruitt's abuse of power &amp; misuse of taxpayer funds.

The American people deserve better &amp; @HouseDemocrats have #ABetterDeal. https://t.co/PVVDLCoBCM. https://t.co/128VvLKjKlDenying protection to those fleeing persecution is cruel and unproductive. Removing children from their parents is unconscionable. Joined @HouseJudDems to send a letter to @DHSgov &amp; @TheJusticeDept demanding answers. #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/bhzQapNUguHaving 50 different mandatory state-level #encryption standards is bad for security, consumers, innovation, &amp; law enforcement.

Today we recommit to fighting for that future. #ThanksGriswold #GriswoldvCTOn June 10, the #EqualPayAct will see its 55th anniversary, yet pay equity is still elusive for women and their families. Proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Act which would close loopholes in current law and put us on a course for equal pay for all. #EqualPayNow https://t.co/uTJLFsGH4IPresident Trump’s #500DaysOfBummer all started with his obsession over the crowd size of his inauguration. Not much has changed since then, just more #AlternativeFacts. https://t.co/rbOQH2qoEuAmong the most important decisions any executive makes are hiring decisions. Shouldn't a "businessman" like President Trump know that? He promised to hire only "the best &amp; most serious people," but look at all the people who've had to resign or were fired so far! #500DaysOfBummer https://t.co/QyeZQ0HXTSPresident Trump promised to break D.C.’s “cycle of corruption” and end “decades of special-interest dealing.” He’s done the exact opposite. #500DaysOfBummer https://t.co/0DiDh6prLSDear @POTUS: Heard you blamed Canada for burning down the White House during the War of 1812 while discussing tariffs with PM Trudeau. Sharing this memo with you, again. https://t.co/vLZgBJtQDt🇷🇺🤔 #500DaysOfBummer https://t.co/vvL4D8ODliDespite vowing to support America’s veterans, President Trump has put forth proposals that would do more damage to the economic security and well-being of veterans and their families.

Also, we still don't have a confirmed Secretary of Veterans Affairs. 🤦‍♂️ 

#500DaysOfBummer https://t.co/I7H8Q1jRc7Since taking office, President Trump has done nothing to support our #LGBT community. To make things worse, for the second year in a row, Trump's White House has failed to recognize June as LGBT #PrideMonth. #500DaysOfBummer https://t.co/cpoRZCwTjGWho is paying for the wall? 

Mexico? 🙅‍♀️ 

American taxpayers? 🙅‍♀️ 

The U.S. Military? 🙅‍♀️ 

#500DaysOfBummer 🤷‍♀️ https://t.co/3kvRdhtDYcPresident Trump has spent 1/5 of his days in office at a golf course. That's probably great for his stroke, but not so great for the American public. #500DaysOfBummer https://t.co/A41Uln6RNdTotally, dude! https://t.co/UXjVjYVqaoThis week, the President reached his 500th day in office.

Join us and share your own Trump Admin expectation vs. reality using the hashtag #500DaysOfBummer https://t.co/5WU8L4zF7i.@POTUS’s expectations haven’t often met reality during his first 500 days in office. The #GOPTaxScam is a prime example of why his presidency has been #500DaysOfBummer https://t.co/xHNjE6KeNXDear @POTUS: On Friday you imposed tariffs on some of the U.S.'s strongest allies because of supposed national security concerns.

Let's go #TeamUSA! https://t.co/svqwMA1XtnWhile it is clear the current President cannot serve as our moral compass, we must not lose sight of our shared virtues. Domestic violence and abuse must always be aggressively condemned. RT if you agree.Instead of offering sympathy to the women who've come forward alleging abuse, Trump wished Porter well &amp; pointed to his claims of innocence. At this point, it’s hard to come up w/ new ways to express total dismay for @POTUS’s appallingly unpresidential remarks &amp; actions in officeIn a watershed time where more women and men are coming forward with harrowing #MeToo stories of abuse, we have the President of the United States praising an aide that was accused of committing domestic violence. https://t.co/gKWh4CXBZcGiven the constitutional questions surrounding @POTUS's unilateral authority to use nuclear weapons &amp; #Trump's statements about using it, it's imperative that @HouseForeign exercise its oversight powers. Requesting HFAC Chairman @RepEdRoyce hold a hearing: https://t.co/oDz2wmuIml https://t.co/my4v8YxWvsAccording to reports, #RobPorter’s alleged abusive behavior was the reason he was unable to secure a permanent security clearance, yet apparently #JohnKelly defended him, promoted him, &amp; urged him to stay. We're asking Mr. Kelly what he knew &amp; when: https://t.co/kuNNUEbsOz. https://t.co/mE1jn3Bk63Proud to join @RepJudyChu to introduce H.R. 4944, the Reuniting Families Act. Supporting our family immigration system is more important now than ever due to the #Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies that threaten to undermine our legal immigration system. https://t.co/BEh0cift7qOn the House Floor with Leader @NancyPelosi sharing stories of #CA33 #DREAMers and demanding @SpeakerRyan commit to bringing up bipartisan legislation to #ProtectDREAMers. #DreamActNow #GoNancyGo https://t.co/5vhLfeAgZIAt a time when Congress is wrestling w/ how best to recapitalize our military &amp; better protect the force, resources should be deployed to enhance military readiness &amp; warfighting, not wasted on a pointless #militaryparade. Our letter w/ @RepRubenGallego: https://t.co/Qrlw5jVPEL. https://t.co/FG1JOjkOugOn @allinwithchris: John Kelly’s smear of #DREAMers who haven't registered for #DACA as just “too lazy” is cruel &amp; uninformed. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe they should be able to stay in the U.S. &amp; continue to contribute to the only country they've ever known. https://t.co/JLeByme8yNIt’s important for the American people to understand why Sessions reversed the very simple policy of letting states go ahead &amp; honor the wishes of their residents in terms of legalizing #marijuana &amp; to understand the rationale for doing this. Why does he believe what he believes? https://t.co/Q7HkAnTj7bHouse @SpeakerRyan celebrated the #GOPTaxScam with this tweet about a secretary saving $1.50 a week, then deleted it. The #GOP's idea of good policy? Trillions to the rich and six quarters a week to the middle class. https://t.co/zHDux97mnCJoined local leaders and community members today to  #ProtectThePacific. We are committed to fighting for our coastal communities by making sure they are not devastated by offshore drilling! https://t.co/kvWV5Fdsej.@RepDevinNunes, @SpeakerRyan, and @HouseGOP have proven they’re willing to put @POTUS @realDonaldTrump’s interest above our national security interest with the release of the #NunesMemo: https://t.co/fG1lMOvkBG. https://t.co/65CxOAU8VcIn #NorthKorea we must first use diplomacy. Americans are worried @realDonaldTrump could launch an unjustified nuclear war. We should pass HR669/S200, bill authored w/ @SenMarkey which requires @POTUS to get Congressional approval before launching a #nuclear first strike. #SOTU https://t.co/dBgKg4DFpIAfter @realDonaldTrump’s first year in office, the U.S. image abroad has taken a hit: the number of foreigners telling pollsters they have a favorable view of the USA fell nearly everywhere. The only big gain was in #Russia. #SOTU #AYearOfTrump https://t.co/KeBr2xEnZF.@realDonaldTrump has broken his promises not to cut #Medicaid &amp; to focus on battling the opioid epidemic: @POTUS Trump had promised never to cut #Medicaid, but his budget proposed a cut of $1.4 trillion. Likewise, Trump has broken his promise to focus on the opioid crisis. #SOTU.@realDonaldTrump's administration has done nothing but advance a mass deportation &amp; anti-immigrant agenda, attacking voting rights, rolling back civil rights efforts across the government &amp; trying to use #DREAMers as bargaining chips for an extreme anti-immigrant agenda. #SOTUThere is a bipartisan agreement including a solution for #DREAMers &amp; border security that Congress would easily pass if Republican leadership would bring it up for a vote. @SpeakerRyan, can we get a vote? #StateOfTheDream #DreamActNow #SOTU
