This is truly an inspirational group of women. https://t.co/tRWh5ULCthIf you live in Birmingham, you probably know we have a train issue. Too many trains are blocking railroad crossings in our city!  Here in Congress, I'm working with officials at every level to get answers and find solutions. https://t.co/ka7MyyILIaAlabama women looking sharp this morning during today’s @NOBELWomen1 Leadership Conference. It was awesome to spend the morning with such an incredible group of leaders!! https://t.co/Ogauium8nRToday and every day, I'm thankful for the tireless work of our local reporters. They put in long hours to get the facts on local stories that are so important to our communities. My heart breaks for those at the #CapitalGazette. Thank you all for your service.What an honor. Last night I met with some of the original Tuskegee Airmen. These veterans are real American HEROES. These veterans overcome discrimination and bigotry to fight for their country – they teach us what it means to be a true patriot. https://t.co/WTemcx5pohA big thank you to the voting rights experts on today's panel - their fight for fair and free elections is truly inspiring @KristenClarkeJD @WendyRWeiser @jbrownedianis @ashleyrallison @LawyersComm @BrennanCenter @adv_project @civilrightsorg @NAACP_LDF #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/dN60ZrwyR7Rep.

Let's sound the alarm. It's time for Congress to #RestoreTheVote!! Our elections should be free and fair. https://t.co/rAlRkfuOwk5 years ago today, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. The impact was immediate - states passed a wave of voter suppression laws. Now it's up to us to #RestoreTheVOTE! https://t.co/HYMvJ46y7o #RestoreTheVOTE #RestoreTheVRAOur elections should run on two principles: free and fair for American voters. Suppression tactics like these fail on both. https://t.co/iodyKPm9gn #RestoreTheVOTE #RestoreTheVRAAmen! Brother Flynt. I’m with you! ⁦ https://t.co/VvcBB7ltVpTogether, we're demanding answers from the Trump Administration on  reconnecting children with their parents. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/VCRxlePtnuhttps://t.co/QRiNhzkIe6
I'm excited to see more job opportunities headed to Alabama's 7th Congressional District!Many migrant girls came to the U.S. to flee the violence back home. Tearing them away from their families exacerbates their trauma. #WhereAreTheGirls? #KeepFamiliesTogether @RepWilson https://t.co/uwDkEB3kmuWhile President Trump’s executive order ends his own manufactured policy of family separation, it paves the way for the long-term incarceration of families in prison-like conditions.  Shameful. #KeepFamiliesTogetherThe US is a country of immigrants with a proud legacy of providing shelter for families fleeing persecution. Trump’s detention policies, from the separation of children and parents to the cruel detention of families seeking safety, do violence to that legacy #KeepFamiliesTogetherMeet my awesome DC interns!!! Happy Selfie Day!

Beat the Press!!! https://t.co/omGrKttjUgMake no mistake - if Trump ends his family separation policy, it will be because people like you spoke out. It's because parents and advocates and voters demanded that this country treat kids humanely. Thank you for speaking up. #KeepFamiliesTogetherToday we stand with child welfare advocates, child physicians, and immigration reform advocates who know that separating children from their parents is inhumane and unlawful. https://t.co/2lomOXDwchMr. President, what you are committing against innocent children is nothing short of child abuse. Pick up the phone, call your cabinet and tell them to stop pursuing a policy of family separation. #KeepFamiliesTogether @realDonaldTrumpThe fact is that Trump could stop separating children from their parents today if he wanted to. But since he won’t, I’m calling on Congress to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act. We need a vote today. Not next week, not next month - today.We cannot stand idly by while this inhumane treatment continues in our country’s name. Proud to join fellow Democrats taking a stand to #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/zxoRXOrwdtRepublicans are bringing the Farm Bill back for another vote - possibly tomorrow. With $23 billion in SNAP cuts, this bill is cruel and shortsighted. We should not be taking food off the table for our country's working families.Let's bring the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act up for a vote today. Not tomorrow, not next week, let's end Trump's inhumane family separation policy now. https://t.co/B4Nj5FblUjI can only imagine the pain of being separated from your family. As a little girl in Selma, my family meant everything to me. Trump’s inhumane treatment of innocent children needs to stop now #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/m64y6cuOmnToday, #Juneteenth, marks the anniversary of the end of slavery in the U.S.  – the day slaves in Galveston were finally freed two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Today we celebrate how far we’ve come since that moment, and acknowledge how far we have to go. https://t.co/D1yrKkOKNiToday I'm cosponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act because we need to put a stop to the Trump Administration’s inhumane and unlawful separation policy. Tearing kids from their families when they are at their most vulnerable is a disgraceful abuse of human rights.My bipartisan bill to address the opioid crisis is coming to the floor for a vote! The Preventing Addiction for Susceptible Seniors (PASS) Act helps prevent abuse among seniors without limiting access to needed medications. https://t.co/S1vGnxwMhDThere is bipartisan legislation in the House that could end the DREAMers crisis right now. The USA Act has 30 GOP cosponsors and 30 Dems - it would pass if it were brought to the floor today. Instead, GOP leaders prefer to keep our immigration system in a state of crisis.We need to let voters choose their lawmakers, not the other way around #RestoreTheVote https://t.co/l9VgGX2VhhThis #FathersDay is a chance for us to reflect on the importance of family - and why it's inhumane to tear families apart. Separating innocent kids from their parents goes against the values we cherish as a country. We're better than that. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWhat a team. This past month, @SenDougJones @SenBooker and I introduced new legislation to fix rural America's broken water and wastewater infrastructure.

Tune in for a live discussion with @repjoecrowley, @RepKClark, @repmarkpocan @CommonCause and I!! →https://t.co/023oX9Jm9ZToday, Democrats are proposing #ABetterDeal: if you are an eligible voter, you are guaranteed a fair voice in our democracy. I am proud to see the VRAA included in the Better Deal for Democracy, and I believe that today’s announcement is an important step to #RestoreTheVOTE!New strategies for disenfranchisement, from gerrymandering to voter ID laws, are keeping citizens from having a meaningful voice in elections and the results are alarming. From healthcare to tax cuts, special interests groups are monopolizing DC #ABetterDeal #RestoreTheVoteIf we want to build a stronger democracy, we have to engage and empower ALL American voters #BetterDeal #RestoreTheVOTEToday, I’m taking a stand with House and Senate Dems for a #BetterDeal for our democracy. Let’s #RestoreTheVOTE, end gerrymandering, and strengthen ethics. We can fix this!! https://t.co/0bwRovfJYZIn two days, foster youth across the country are headed to DC to shadow Members of Congress from both parties. I can't wait to meet my partner, Lakeidra from Tuscaloosa!! When we talk about child welfare, we have to raise #FosterYouthVoices!The #FarmBill may have failed last week, but Republicans are still trying to push through massive cuts to food assistance. After the GOP passed a $2 trillion tax cut for the wealthy, their attacks on #SNAP for poor families is a COMPLETE moral failure. I'm taking a stand. https://t.co/sUykexxTjwI am a Royal Watcher!

It's time to act on infrastructure: https://t.co/EZrF1Ru3kO #TimeToBuild https://t.co/bHH2OEZrYOWater and wastewater are critical components of our national infrastructure. That's why I introduced new, bipartisan legislation today with @RepMikeRogersAL to fix our broken wastewater systems in rural America. It's #TimeToBuild!! #InfrastructureWeek https://t.co/rbx33mciwoHere's what we did get when Republicans charged $2.2 trillion to our national credit card: corporate stock buybacks are up 43 percent, that means the rich are getting richer, and executives who are compensated in shares are seeing their wealthy skyrocket. #GOPTaxScamThe fact is that consumer spending has not accelerated. Wages for middle-class families are not up. GDP growth has not accelerated. Instead, the #GOPTaxScam left us with a $2.2 trillion deficit and cuts to health and safety net programs that working families rely on. https://t.co/fdOma0xpbyToday, Republicans on the @WaysMeansCmte are trying to defend the disastrous #GOPTaxScam with one-off anecdotes. But let's keep our eyes on the facts. The fact is that the majority of tax cuts went to wealthy Americans, leaving working families with the tab. https://t.co/eHNMKnGrNCGreat panel today at the #CAPIdeas Conference!

Washington Magnet High School - last night she was named Alabama's Teacher of the Year!! It's public school teachers like Ms. Simmons who are preparing our next generation of leaders #TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/tYn0OjZSXaRight now, less than 20 percent of Members of Congress are women. That's not representative of who we are as a nation! For so many women candidates, affording childcare during evening campaign events and weekend trips is a major barrier. We're working to fix that. https://t.co/ex6XYvM3XeWe need to start giving women a seat at the table. To all the working moms out there who are running for public office this year for the first time - we are proud of you. Keep on making history! We're calling on the FEC to give you a fair shot.If we want a Congress that reflects the diversity of the American people, we have to break down barriers for women who want to run for office! That's why I led a letter today urging the FEC to authorize candidates to use campaign funds on childcare. 23 House Members cosigned! https://t.co/rUPTYuvXHEAmazing panel on voting rights and black voter turnout in Alabama!!

We have to organize, we have to mobilize, and we have to #RestoreTheVote! #LPC2018 https://t.co/TEI4GzWPxDPresident Trump’s reckless withdrawal from the #IranDeal has the potential to destabilize an already unstable region. Unilaterally walking away from this agreement leaves America isolated and puts our national security at risk! Terrible decision.After months of conversations with nuclear experts, military officials, and constituent groups, I decided to support the #IranDeal because it was our best option for ensuring a nuclear-free Iran. It wasn't perfect, but collective enforcement made it the best path forward.Big win for Highlands Bar and Grill! Congrats to @FrankStitt, Dolester Miles, and the incredible team there. Please join me in congratulating the most outstanding restaurant in America!! https://t.co/zSYjRDOxd2The Trump Administration isn't just cutting a hole in our social safety net - they're selling it entirely in order to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy!!

So proud to see my niece Neshambia Nicole Sewell graduate. https://t.co/YZkSqoaIm5Never doubt the ability of our youngest generation to lead the way. This weekend we remember the the children in Birmingham who marched for justice and equality when so many adults perpetuated a system of racism and segregation. https://t.co/yw7TLMTjXzEvery 40 seconds, another American suffers from a stroke. But here's what you should know - strokes are treatable and many can be prevented. Check out these helpful tips on how to reduce stroke risk and how to recognize a stroke: https://t.co/QzslQdeupz #StrokeAwarnessMonthThis #StrokeMonth I want to share my father's story. Coach Sewell taught math and coached basketball, football and golf for 36 years. He helped his students grow and build their skills. But a series of debilitating strokes left him wheelchair-bound for the last years of his life. https://t.co/gd9O8Nth4iI had the privilege of presenting a Purple Heart to widow of Korean War veteran, Willie Matthews today. I’m proud to have this incredible family in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District! https://t.co/Tn0Mj2QKGTI got to live out a childhood fantasy today, “flying” an F-35! This was an incredible demonstration. I have such respect for the men and women who really do this everyday! https://t.co/TDQMSQXmPvLet's build a world where silencing women is not "very common" among celebrities and people of wealth... https://t.co/IoiY28OjQnJust wrapped up our second town hall today - this town hall in Sumter County. THANK YOU to the constituents who turned out to make their voices heard!!! https://t.co/YrEyPKJYjETo Sumter Central High School’s 2018 graduating class and co-valedictorians Xavier Turner and Margi Patel: never stop chasing your dreams. You are brave, you are strong, and you have the power to achieve whatever you put your mind to! We are proud of you. https://t.co/d8FJMcfhaPGreat town hall today in Aliceville! Thanks to everyone who turned out - we need to make your voices heard in Congress!! And thank you to Mayor Gipson for hosting! https://t.co/GG1NRXUB9VSay congrats to this year’s Congressional Art Competition winner, from Alabama’s 7th Congressional District, Destinye Jones!! Her artwork is now headed to D.C. to hang the in the U.S. Capitol for the next year. https://t.co/nlbKwN1QCtMr. President, the Special Counsel's team has either indicted or gotten guilty pleas from 19 people and three companies so far, including four of your former advisers. Crimes happened. Please get your facts straight. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/lBrbexkkNmAs the daughter of two educators and the product of public schools, I know the power of public education. That's why I introduced the Public Funds for Public Schools Act to close the private school voucher tax loophole. We have to protect taxpayer funds meant for public education https://t.co/PQ6TMhhvV2Under current law, wealthy donors in states like Alabama can turn a profit on contributions to private school voucher organizations by claiming state and federal tax benefits. Terrible use of public funds that could b helping public schools! https://t.co/jnk7aozUTxOMG! Dave Matthews in the flesh!! Thanks for being in Alabama! #DaveMatthewsBand https://t.co/JscnvXKawHDave Matthews playing EJI’s Concert for Peace and Justice in Montgomery,AL @davematthewsbnd https://t.co/bRA1y6ScvfSeven years ago today, the most damaging tornado in Alabama history cut a mile-wide path through Tuscaloosa, one of 64 tornadoes that struck Alabama that day. The Alabamians we lost that day are deeply missed, and will live forever in our hearts and memories. https://t.co/06JGnpFCgwMy night has been made! To hang with @repjohnlewis! It doesn’t get better!!! Thanks John Lewis for getting into #GoodTrouble https://t.co/m6Bs2Dl2MJAttending the Opening Ceremony for the EJI National Museum and Memorial for Peace and Justice tonight. So excited to see @repjohnlewis https://t.co/VKW6u9oZLOI’m so grateful to have had the opportunity to share this experience with my mom! This is a very important reminder of a painful past and I hope it helps bring some much needed healing. https://t.co/PtOtzc76zlIt’s overwhelming to see the sheer magnitude of lynchings across the state of Alabama and across the country. These where dark times in our nation’s history and it’s a incredible to see these victims being finally acknowledged. I’m hopeful this brings about some needed healing. https://t.co/ojxXEtxi6AToday, I'll be in Montgomery for the unveiling of the first ever memorial to victims of lynching and racial terror in America. This Memorial finds its home in AL, where more than 300 African Americans were killed by lynching and millions more were terrorized by white supremacy.As we reflect on the anniversary of #Flint, rural America is facing another water crisis: deteriorating wastewater infrastructure. We have to act before it's too late #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/6QPRwwpoI3No matter how painful, these are memories which our nation must confront. Tomorrow, I'll be in attendance for the opening of our nation's first memorial to victims of lynching and racial terror. https://t.co/w9tNPFHUThAs we recognize the anniversary of Flint, where state and federal support came years after the contamination of local drinking water, we have to take this opportunity to reflect on the need for immediate action to repair our water and wastewater infrastructure. https://t.co/vQyscn0CYQThe health impacts of failing wastewater treatment are destructive and costly. In parts of rural Alabama where straight pipes are common, residents have tested positive for parasites that were thought to have been eradicated from the U.S. decades ago. https://t.co/nTl5sVOJvQThere is no national study estimating the number of families in the United States without a connection to proper wastewater treatment, but based on the experiences of Alabama, Minnesota, and Kentucky, the issue could easily impact millions of Americans.But rural Alabama is not the only area where wastewater infrastructure has created a health crisis. One 2004 study showed that an estimated 60,000 residents in Minnesota used a straight pipe to empty untreated sewage into the environment around their house.I have seen this crisis firsthand in rural Alabama. In our state’s rural Black Belt, I have toured rural communities where a home’s only sewage system is a straight pipe that carries untreated waste 30 feet into the woods. https://t.co/mGZxfOpc36As we recognize the fourth anniversary of Flint, another water crisis is brewing in our nation's backyard - in rural America, deteriorating infrastructure and lack of investment have left an untold number of families without access to wastewater treatment https://t.co/6QPRwwpoI3Every day, I'm proud to meet with and hear from constituents in my district who aren't lobbyists. Public service means putting these working families first, not paid special interests @MickMulvaneyOMB https://t.co/1LIx049C9vI came to Congress because I care about the people of Alabama's 7th District, and I want to grow jobs, strengthen education, and help working families. That's why I meet with constituents regardless of campaign contributions @MickMulvaneyOMB https://t.co/SY3qVMJok0Here's a picture of me meeting with constituents who didn't pay me. You should try it sometime @MickMulvaneyOMB https://t.co/Sis1nKrD5JTrump's cabinet has made a mockery of public service. It's time for this Administration to start appointing agency leaders who put the American people first, not themselves. https://t.co/rOg1pyYNdXI'm hiring one Wounded Warrior or medically retired veteran for a position in my Birmingham office. In Congress and back home, helping our veterans into the civilian workforce is a top priority. Learn more and apply: https://t.co/si9E2PPK8HIn 1982, I graduated as Selma High School's first black valedictorian. It was a public school that helped make me who I am today, and now I'm fighting for public schools here in Congress. From early education to graduation - let's invest in our classrooms. https://t.co/Vwwy6IK32EToday is the first day of #NationalParkWeek!! I'm celebrating the many historic sites in Alabama including the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument. #FindYourPark https://t.co/IvOcufKU3UIn Uniontown, in Lowndes County, and across rural America, I am fighting for clean water and wastewater treatment - EVERY American deserves these basic services. https://t.co/wOigCY0cQYGreat talk today on how we can help working families get the most from their tax returns at @urbaninstitute! So many great ideas on tax reform that puts American families first!! #LiveAtUrban https://t.co/eXwMe0lQboSending my prayers and condolences to the Bush family on the passing of Barbara Bush, former First Lady and classic act who changed the lives of millions with her focus on literacy. #RIPBarbaraBush  https://t.co/qgwrsGERI4 https://t.co/dg7JnUfZbiToday I spoke on the House floor to honor a mentor, a fellow Selma-native, a voting rights activist, and an American hero, Reverend Dr. Frederick Douglas Reese. He will be missed, and his legacy will never be forgotten. https://t.co/kug67tUzNBBut here's where the #GOPTaxScam hits working families the hardest: healthcare. Under the new law, 13 million Americans will lose healthcare coverage, and tax breaks for the wealthy set the stage for Medicare and Medicaid cuts. Shameful. #TaxDayWhile most hardworking Americans aren’t noticing an increase in their paychecks from the tax law, average Wall Street bonuses have jumped an average of 17 percent to $184,220!! That's the highest since the financial crisis a decade ago, many times higher than average pay. #TaxDayThis #TaxDay, let's talk about the real impact of the #GOPTaxScam: higher costs for working families and huge breaks for the top 1 percent. Instead of investing in billionaires, our tax system should put the American worker first!!Why we can not wait! MLK wrote 'Letter from Birmingham Jail' 55 years ago! Let us recommit ourselves to the ideals of equality and justice for all! #restoretheVOTE https://t.co/RdURNgsklV https://t.co/BskZAttvBXToday I’m celebrating the one year anniversary of the dedication of the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument! It was one of my greatest honors as a Member of Congress to lead the fight for the recognition of Birmingham’s role in the civil rights movement. https://t.co/Ypr7gSm6irWishing our Sikh American neighbors, classmates &amp; colleagues a happy #Vaisakhi!Today, I am joining so many in Selma for Rev. Dr. F.D. Reese's funeral. Dr. Reese was a friend, a mentor, and an American hero. One of my greatest honors in Congress was to present Dr. Reese with the Congressional Gold Medal for his work as a voting rights foot soldier. https://t.co/6DvO3gSeySToday we remembered the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's death at a ceremony in the Capitol. Powerful words from MLK III. https://t.co/GORKeEWeodSo powerful. What a beautiful way to mark a tragic history. https://t.co/Y7BaA1pRohThis scenario might have been unthinkable under any other president in modern history, but Trump has shown he will not hesitate to undermine democratic institutions. When it comes to defending our democracy, I'm hopeful that Members on both sides of the aisle can come together.I'm calling on Congress to pass a bill protecting the Russia investigation from President Trump. In order to avert a constitutional crisis, Congress has to act to protect Mueller’s investigation.Today, I brought train company reps and members of the Birmingham City Council together to talk about solutions to waste transportation happening in our city. It’s time to find a fix!! https://t.co/CoXSbAgDc0I think it's important to work with Republicans and Democrats to do what's right for constituents. I was proud today to see one of my proposals, the Preserving Taxpayers Rights Act, pass in Committee today! A big thank you to my Republican partner on this bill, @RepJasonSmith!! https://t.co/BFKAaccdUUWith Coach @NickSabanUofA and the Crimson Tide at the White House! #NationalChamps  #RollTide https://t.co/tXIhbYhXzYRoll Tide! National Champs at the White House today! #RTR #NationalChampions https://t.co/OQfdsVt3wZLast year Facebook accepted Rubles from Russian trolls who posted ads to interfere in our elections. Social media platforms need to defend against foreign attacks, but so do our campaigns, our lawmakers, and our election infrastructure. That's why I've introduced the SHIELD Act.To every woman who is underpaid, under-promoted, and under-valued in the workplace, I am fighting for you. It's time to close the pay gap! #EqualPayDay https://t.co/eeuZN58XyDThe pay gap isn't a myth, it's math. Today, on #EqualPayDay, I'm stepping up our fight for equality in the workplace. https://t.co/ZRfZalTHynToday I join the @JudsonCollege community in mourning the passing of Dr. David Potts. I had the great privilege of meeting and working with Dr. Potts and I saw firsthand how he he cared for his students. So grateful for Dr. Pott's leadership. He will be missed. https://t.co/hXDEctDbVD“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. https://t.co/TazCyKmM2GIn their memory, let us recommit ourselves to the ideals of freedom and justice that King and Gandhi died to advance. So thankful for our bipartisan visit with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. https://t.co/JjHOtAUWRNAs we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the death of Dr. King, it was my honor to be in India- the birthplace of Gandhi whose teaching of nonviolence had such a profound affect on King. https://t.co/HApfjj7fAkMy statement on the passing of the legendary Reverend Dr. Frederick D. Reese. He will be dearly missed. https://t.co/0T5faIgUIB https://t.co/raPhsXIbXjOne of my greatest honors as a Member of Congress was to present Dr. Reese with the gold medal at the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony that honored foot soldiers of the 1965 Voting Rights Marches. He was a brilliant and beautiful soul who made this world a brighter place. https://t.co/7cAmgGzlYNDr. Reese is an American hero, whose work as an educator, pastor, and civil rights activist will never be forgotten. I am truly heartbroken to hear of his passing. https://t.co/txohfD306DWe won't forget Kamden. Our fight for safe child care centers is not over. https://t.co/5OKmBhJD43So many detractors told Dr. King that now wasn't the right time to speak up, or that taking a stand was unpatriotic. Today, we still have detractors, but we will not be silenced. We will stand up to hatred and injustice wherever we encounter it. https://t.co/8WIl6YQF28From the students protesting gun violence to the football players who take a knee to speak out for #BlackLivesMatter, I am so proud of the men and women who are continuing Dr. King's march towards justice 50 years later.As we remember Dr. King on the 50th anniversary of his death, I want to share one of his speeches that resonates today - on the power of love. As anger and hate drive a wedge between Americans, let's remember what Dr. King taught us, that love will win our fight for justice. https://t.co/SrWr4v5ecsThe government funding bill which passed last month included a 14% increase in funding for HBCUs!! For schools in my district, like @StillmanCollege, that funding is going to make a real difference. A big thank you to all the lawmakers who support our HBCUs here in Congress!!! https://t.co/MoJCQ0tF9UTrump's refusal to restore DACA goes back on our promise to DREAMers - that in exchange for coming forward, paying taxes, and contributing as members of our armed services and students in our schools, they would be allowed to stay in the country they call home. Disgraceful.Happy Easter from my family to yours!! https://t.co/EcZHMtlOdvI had a wonderful time with you guys this morning! Thank you to the faculty and staff @SchoolDiscovery for all of your wonderful work with these incredible students!! https://t.co/GjHTRoA5zhI loved reading to these beautiful young minds this afternoon at Easter Seal Head Start.

I’m looking forward to updating residents on what’s happening in DC and hearing their concerns. I want to assure them that I’m committed to helping them resolve issues facing the community. https://t.co/lD5mH9TgFDI had a great briefing with the team at Harvest Select this afternoon, I’m proud to have this incredible facility in my district! https://t.co/WGRQzoufNrMeeting with the president of the Marion Military Institute (MMI) this afternoon.

Honored to meet with Mayor Maddox and the Tuscaloosa City Council. #Tuscaloosa https://t.co/1UxKpMCFE4I had the chance to speak with residents in Tuscaloosa about what’s happening in DC during today’s “Congress in Your Community.” I go to work everyday thinking about the needs of those I was chosen to represent, and hearing from them plays a vital role in my job as a law maker. https://t.co/4BkeWWSaV7Shout out to students at Crestmont Elementary for their warm welcome today!! Thank you for making me feel at home in your school.💕😄🏡 https://t.co/4BuRMBHZ8TEvery year more students and teachers, sons and daughters, and brothers and sisters are killed in school shootings – we need to do everything in our power to make this stop. It's time for action. #NeverAgain https://t.co/V4xTRSxPwVNEXT WEDS - I'm hosting a town hall in Uniontown, Alabama. I've made it a top priority to hear from constituents about what they think on the big issues facing Congress. RSVP here: https://t.co/e91FIeBBGI https://t.co/zWJKLefiM8#StephonClark was shot 20 times by police in his own grandmother's yard. He was just 22 years old and a father of two.  These tragedies have to stop. We need accountability for the epidemic of police violence in this country. #BlackLivesMatterMr. President, we have proposed any number of bipartisan DACA fixes - you have rejected each and every one. If you want action on DACA, tell Speaker Ryan to bring the bipartisan #USAAct to the floor ASAP. We have been pushing for action since you ended the DACA program.I want to say a special thank you to today’s COPS grants workshop guest speakers, Officer Atkins with the City of Bessemer and Chief Finley with the City of Montgomery.  You guys are awesome. I’m excited to continue working with our districts law enforcement! https://t.co/RMpKvlUmULToday our office hosted representatives from cities across the 7th Congressional District for a COPS Grants Workshop.  The workshop targeted municipal and county level law enforcement to help them find federal funding for their community oriented policing services (COPS). https://t.co/mN1E5nmZNMToday, on #WorldWaterDay, Congress just passed an additional $1.8 billion in funding for water and wastewater infrastructure. That's a huge win for areas like Lowndes County, Alabama, where deteriorating septic and sewage systems can create serious economic and health challenges. https://t.co/b0PhAAEMc5New funding for wastewater infrastructure is going to have a real life impact in rural America. I have seen firsthand the economic and health challenges created by deteriorating septic systems, and today’s bill takes a step forward. https://t.co/ONzAjPVAsXToday's legislation is a step forward in making sure that our day care centers follow the law and that no more children like Kamden are put at risk. So proud to see Republicans and Democrats rally around a commonsense solution to protect our kids. https://t.co/jG23IwDxEHIt is our job to make sure that federal resources are directed to accountable centers that care for our children’s health and safety, especially as safe child care centers like Head Start struggle to receive the funding they need.Big news- my amendment prohibiting federal funds for unsafe child care centers is included in the omnibus bill poised to pass the House. I originally introduced this amendment last summer, after the death of Kamden Johnson at an AL daycare violating health and safety codes. https://t.co/f0GLzfICWUToday I met with social work students from the University of Alabama! A big thank you to these young leaders dedicating themselves to public service!! https://t.co/pfA7sAML5bWe need to put the United States in the strongest trade position possible - when this President threatens our allies, like South Korea, he takes us in the opposite direction. Today, I took my concerns to President Trump's trade representative. @WaysMeansCmte https://t.co/Vq03RVz3wK35 million Americans still lack access to broadband, including over 800k Alabamians. The digital divide is worse in rural areas, limiting access to education, workforce development and other opportunities. To build a competitive economy, we must connect ALL Americans!! @JECDems https://t.co/gYwmno1Id6Alabama in the house!! Today, we turned out for an #HBCU lunch in Congress to talk about the big challenges and the big opportunities that lay ahead for our HBCUs. Great seeing @TuskegeeUniv there! https://t.co/z19QRFcYM6When our law enforcement and intelligence communities rely on race to make judgements instead of facts, the safety of the public is put at risk. At today's briefing experts have testified that the FBI's racist designation is already filtering down to local law enforcement.Today we’re holding a public hearing on the FBI’s targeting of black activists through a new “black identity extremist” designation. The FBI has a disturbing history of racial discrimination. We cannot allow our law enforcement to target black people for speaking out. https://t.co/etJkYcKBueAlabama is home to over 42,000 farms and over 8 million acres of farmland. Today, I'm celebrating the farmers and workers who keep our agricultural industry growing!!

Here is a helpful list of community shelters across the state: https://t.co/Qo5aB5QeKMA tornado watch is in effect for parts of Alabama through 11pm - the  @cityofbhamal has opened three emergency shelters located at: 1331 Third St., Pratt City; 305 Pratt Highway;, and 1707 Huntington Drive, SmithfieldOur local law enforcement need the tools and resources to fight crime. That's why I'm hosting a grants workshop this Thursday for city &amp; county officials to talk about federal funding opportunities for our police. See you there! https://t.co/PDF9Aw87vuActually, @realDonaldTrump, the Mueller investigation has charged 19 different individuals with crimes, including your 2016 campaign chairman and 13 Russian nationals. Get your facts straight. https://t.co/CtFOLI0B58Today in #WomensHistoryMonth I'm recognizing modern-day history maker Sarah Parcak @indyfromspace, an archaeologist and founding director of the Laboratory for Global Observation at UAB.

Louise was a trailblazer who paved the way for so many other women in Congress. As the first woman to chair the House Rules Committee, she was a force in our fight for women and working families. She will be missed.Don’t be fooled, Alabama's new Medicaid work requirements aren't targeted at putting Alabamians back to work. They serve the sole purpose of taking away health coverage from our state’s most vulnerable parents. https://t.co/lMfmtZIZlKOur children should be looking forward to their future not writing a will!  Congress must act to end the gun violence! This is exhibit A!! #MarchForOurLives  https://t.co/DQsYsmUuvMIf we want to govern, Dems need a modern, hopeful economic vision - a new social contract for the Digital Age. I've proposed new legislation on workforce training because everyone should have the tools they need to compete in today's economy #OpportunityToEarn @ThirdWayTweetPraying for the victims of the shooting yesterday at UAB Highlands Hospital. Our health professionals look out for us - it's our job to make sure they are safe. We have to keep fighting for action in Congress on gun violence. Too many lives are at stake. https://t.co/Seh0OJQGquIn honor of Courtlin Arrington, age 17, of Huffman High School in Birmingham,AL I joined the students for today’s #EnoughIsEnoughDMV event at the Capitol. #NeverAgain #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/PE270jby3VThere's so much work left to be done, from witnesses that should be compelled to testify to phone records that should be subpoenaed. As Mueller, the media, and the Senate continue to uncover the facts, this Committee’s failure to complete its investigation will be sadly apparent.For any American who cares about the integrity and security of our elections, the shut down of our investigation into Russia's attack is nothing short of shameful. Our intel community has publicly highlighted Russia’s interference, but the GOP would rather turn a blind eye.Today in #WomensHistoryMonth I want to recognize Birmingham's own #VonettaFlowers - the first black woman ever to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Thank you Vonetta for inspiring so many young women in our state to follow their dreams!! https://t.co/gdrAQp9azMSo long Austin!

As we recognize the #sheroes and trailblazers who fought for equality and our rights, let's also remember how far we have to go. Women still make up less than 20% of Congress - we need to put more of our women leaders into office!We must protect our schools from gun violence, accidental or not. Each year more students and teachers are killed in school shootings– we need to do everything in our power to make this the last. We can't settle for symbolic gestures when lives are at stake. Congress must act.I cannot imagine the grief of the parents who lost their little girl today to gun violence at Huffman High School. She was a part of our community’s future. Tonight, my prayers are with her, the other victim, and their families.My heart is breaking tonight for those hurt and killed in the shooting today at Huffman High School. As we continue to learn more, please pray with me for the victims and their families. https://t.co/d37LS7nhAW5 years ago today, a strong #VAWA Reauthorization was signed into law.

Apply now to join my internship program: https://t.co/eEnCDn044o https://t.co/ujXI5rgRunThank you so much to advocates like @StartTalkingAL, who are fighting to raise awareness and reduce the stigma around HIV. To #EndAIDS2030, we need everyone in our communities, especially communities of color, to #GetTested. https://t.co/9kQ8iQ1Tl6Singing our way to the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We will never be silent in the face of injustice #MLKPilgrimage @RepBarbaraLee @repjohnlewis @SenKamalaHarris https://t.co/DDpThKZznFThis little boy came to Brown Chapel AME Church this morning to thank his hero, John Lewis. What he didn’t expect was for John Lewis to thank him, for keeping his movement and his fight for justice alive. This is what our #MLKPilgrimage is about. https://t.co/RTljz1PlJiJohn Lewis speaks live at Brown Chapel AME Church  https://t.co/DzvohiHx8OMy mom is speaking today at Brown Chapel AME Church - the same Church where John Lewis once gathered with voting rights foot soldiers for the march across Edmund Pettus Bridge #MLKPilgrimage https://t.co/vKbLGQZESEToday we remember the sacrifices of those who marched across this bridge for their right to vote, even in the face of violence and hate. Their fight for justice is not over. #MLKPilgrimage https://t.co/sxphVWG8D4Such an honor to walk the path of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march with my friends @SenKamalaHarris and @SenDougJones #MLKPilgrimage https://t.co/SJFrIioURMCrossing the bridge this morning with Mrs. Abernathy and @SenKamalaHarris. #MLKPilgrimage https://t.co/angA78YitqThis morning I had the pleasure of sharing part of Selma’s history with @SenKamalaHarris at the Selma Interpretive Center.  We must understand our history or we are doomed to repeat it! https://t.co/x0rZgt6VLxSo happy to see so many national leaders and friends like @RepBarbaraLee on our civil rights pilgrimage this weekend. #MLKPilgrimage https://t.co/zhZdoPiRUnWe’re here at First Baptist Church Ripley in Montgomery for the #MLKPilgrimage its been a beautiful weekend, sharing stories and honoring our history! https://t.co/gBfwXfspucEnjoying this beautiful Saturday with one of my favorite people @repjohnlewis It’s a blessing to share this journey with you my friend! #MLKPilgrimage @FaithNPolitics https://t.co/HQsacoe65DIt was here that four little girls - Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley - lost their lives in the bombing of the 16th St Baptist Church. This weekend we remember their lives and those of so many foot soldiers in the civil rights movement https://t.co/CRCXLx6GEoIn Birmingham, delegation photo @FaithNPolitics at 16th Street Baptist Church. @WhipHoyer  @RepBarbaraLee @RepValDemings @cathymcmorris @RepDonBeyer @RepGaryPalmer @repjohnlewis @SusanBrooksIN @janschakowsky #juan https://t.co/Ijfy8QEx6qParticipants of this year’s @FaithNPolitics Civil Rights Pilgrimage hearing stories of resilience at 16th Street Baptist Church. @repjohnlewis @SenDougJones https://t.co/mXGIGdgmMN@SenDougJones and I getting ready to kick the Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage with @FaithNPolitics it’s going to be a great weekend! https://t.co/S5vRXqNqv8Next weekend @sxsw, I'm hosting a panel with @axios cofounder @mikeallen and voting rights expert @rickhasen for a conversation about access to the ballot box and my fight to #ReformTheVote! See you at #SXSW18! https://t.co/kxxrvseeCKThis weekend, I'm joining @repjohnlewis leading a delegation of nearly 30 Members of Congress to see the historic civil rights and voting rights sites of Birmingham, Montgomery, &amp; Selma! Let's honor the past, and reflect on the road ahead in our fight for justice. https://t.co/Lpc8RSIBpK@EUintheUS - I'm going to be at SXSW next weekend! Would love to connect about opportunities to engage with the EU delegation! Email christopher.mackenzie@mail.house.gov to coordinate.Today's story of the suffrage movement so often imagines America's suffragettes as uniformly white. That was not the case. From Sojourner Truth to Nannie Helen Burroughs, we must remember the courageous black women who stood up for their right to vote #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/Cajmdupxhw“Not till race, color, sex, and condition are seen as the accidents, and not the substance of life... not till then is woman's lesson taught and woman's cause won." -Anna Julia Cooper, 1893 #WomensHistoryMonthToday, let's remember Ida B. Wells, who led the fight for women's rights but was asked to march at the back of the women's suffrage parade because she was black. She refused, and marched beside the Illinois delegation. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/vxDAyVUX1cAs #WomensHistoryMonth begins, I want to take a moment to recognize all of the black women who fought for women's suffrage, but were forced to wait decades for their right to vote even after the signing of the #19thAmendment. https://t.co/f7rNxvjz1DGreat visit today @LakeshoreFound with @bonniestjohn! What a great org in our district!! Keep up the awesome job!! https://t.co/iAeuaulyyIToday in #BlackHistoryMonth, I want to recognize the hundreds of young students who faced fire hoses, and police dogs, and billy clubs in the 1963 Birmingham Campaign for civil rights. They are a reminder that even our children know what it means to stand up for what's right. https://t.co/7fgzK11TVSExcited to welcome my dear friend @bonniestjohn to Birmingham as keynote speaker for the #Momentum Women’s Conference today https://t.co/RWxYYmZZU5A big thank you to Dr. Quinton Ross and John Richardson from @ASUHornetNation! For so many constituents in my district, HBCUs are where the first member of their family went to college and where the latest generation is getting their degree. https://t.co/0EJIA1kzrIAlso proud to meet with Charlotte Morris, President of @TuskegeeUniv and Dr. Billy Hawkins, President of @TalladegaColleg. Thank you for fighting for our HBCUs! https://t.co/3g6mIdFtFVThis week, HBCU leaders have flown in to meet with Members of Congress. Here, I’m meeting with Dr. Cynthia Warrick if @StillmanCollege and @RepAdams https://t.co/65xRfIQQJ2A full 83% of voters support net neutrality, but today the FCC is publishing their final rule to repeal the Open Internet Order. It's time for Congress to act - we have to stand with the public and reinstate #NetNeutrality!Today in #BlackHistoryMonth I am honoring Birmingham native @CondoleezzaRice. In 2005, Rice was appointed as the first African American Woman Secretary of State. Also an educator, an avid pianist and figure skater, Condoleezza Rice is truly a renaissance woman. https://t.co/xJMKuhzbUFRepresenting our HBCUs!! #GoHornets 🐝💛🖤 https://t.co/aq0MuPj8KmAn estimated 100,000 eligible voters in Alabama don't have the necessary ID to cast a ballot. We need to stop shutting Americans out of our democracy. https://t.co/4wvwBxz3vhThis #BlackHistoryMonth, I'm celebrating history makers from Alabama. Today I'm recognizing Ralph David Abernathy from Linden, AL. A dear friend of Dr. King, Abernathy was a founding member of the Montgomery Improvement Association, where the Montgomery Bus Boycott was created. https://t.co/qCGW5pPme1With the 2018 elections looming, it is so important that we get to the bottom of Russia’s meddling and work to protect our elections from another attack.It is deeply disturbing that Trump delayed the release of this memo in an effort to mislead the American public and discredit the FBI. Now that attacks against the FBI have been debunked, I hope we can focus on the investigation of Russia’s attack on our democracy.The Democratic memo released today confirms that the FBI had ample reason to believe Carter Page was acting as the agent of a foreign power and that the FBI acted appropriately in their investigation of Page.Day 2 of Power Rising Summit in Atlanta, the Ladies of CBC are still in the place!  #PowerRising18 #IAmPowerRising @RepBonnie @RepRobinKelly @RepYvetteClarke https://t.co/TVss83EcBJWith the phenomenal @RepLauraHallD19 at Power Rising Conference!! #PowerRising18 #IAmPowerRising https://t.co/zTnnCcxlJqCBC Women are at the Table! #PowerRising18 #IAmPowerRising @RepBonnie  @RepWilson https://t.co/taYyYMndyBToday in #BlackHistoryMonth, I'm recognizing the life of Claudette Colvin. When Claudette was just 14, she was arrested for not giving up her seat to a white woman.  What many people don’t know is that Claudette was arrested for this offense 9 months before Rosa Parks. https://t.co/zOUVqJzuvNTrump says that the "People that treat us badly, we treat them much worse." Does that apply to Russia @realDonaldTrump? Because your Administration refuses to implement Congress-passed sanctions against them. #CPAC2018Donald Trump at #CPAC2018 is again claiming credit for victories he had no part in. It was @BarackObama who saved the auto industry in the United States. Let's keep our facts straight. https://t.co/P40B92Lb81Today I visited with residents of  Lowndes County to see the sewage problems firsthand. This is a problem that has plagued residents in this area for years and I’m hopeful we can work together to find a permanent solution. #WeCanDoBetter https://t.co/p4duvn23U9Alabama’s 187th Air National Guard Unit in Montgomery is no stranger to making history. So proud to see this historic unit land the F-35!  https://t.co/66MvquLv9lDon't let anyone tell you our government can't do anything about gun violence. We can. It's time for action. https://t.co/x6VWqmwvwyGreat day today to visit ASU President Quinton Ross!
Go Hornets! @alabamastateu https://t.co/ljhFlYTM6EI am deeply saddened to hear of Billy Graham’s passing. He was instrumental in spreading the gospel to millions. He will always be remembered as a friend to the civil rights movement when violent racism was an accepted norm in America. He will be missed. https://t.co/gWRqyT2OItSo proud of the teen survivors in Florida who are taking their message to lawmakers. Despite the tragedy they suffered, they are using their voices to speak out for change. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/LTp7qoAJGL#HBD to my friend, colleague and hero, @repjohnlewis!! Your leadership on issues from gun violence to voting rights is an inspiration every day. Wishing you a happy birthday!! ❤️🎉🎈 https://t.co/oqmkWEarjxToday in #BlackHistoryMonth I’m honoring one of the most celebrated athletes in American history, Mobile-native, “Hammerin” Hank Aaron. Hank had a storied career, breaking numerous hitting records, including Babe Ruth’s long standing home run record. https://t.co/58dsCBn0ZCToday in #BlackHistoryMonth, I'm honoring Maria Fearing from Gainesville. Born into slavery, Fearing was 33 before she learned to read and write. After emancipation, she taught at home and abroad, dedicating her life to the well being and education of others. https://t.co/BjRa6rmbvaOn Wednesday, February 21, I'm hosting a town hall meeting in Montgomery to provide an opportunity for residents of the 7th Congressional District to share their views and concerns and hear updates on the latest in Congress. RSVP here: https://t.co/kbKMY7l0Zl https://t.co/6vlOn4E5jLJoin me this Thursday for a town hall in Hayneville! https://t.co/OTuj0PagGwI want to say Congratulations to HS senior, Destinye Jones! She is the first place winner of the Congressional Art Competition for AL’s 7th Congressional District. She created this masterpiece, which is now headed to our nation’s Capitol!! Awesome job Destinye! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 https://t.co/LYiotlYtipIt was Jackson's death that helped to inspire the Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches which awakened our nation's conscience to civil rights abuses and violent racism in America. We must never forget those who fought, bled, and died for our right to vote. #BlackHistoryMonthBefore his death, Jimmie Lee Jackson tried repeatedly to register to vote, but could not under the discriminatory Jim Crow laws of the South. As a deacon at the St. James Baptist Church, Jackson was inspired by Dr. King to help the civil rights movement. #BlackHistoryMonthToday in #BlackHistoryMonth, I want to recognize Jimmie Lee Jackson from Marion, Alabama. It was on this day, 53 years ago, that Jackson was beaten and shot to death by police in a peaceful civil rights march. He was just 26 years old. https://t.co/WHHYA2bD3KThen let’s work together to 1) hold Russia accountable for their actions and 2) protect our elections to make sure this doesn’t happen again. Stop thinking about yourself and start thinking about the country @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/n0RoCxpXIEToday, I had the privilege to celebrate 15 sites in Selma and Montgomery designated as part of the 2018 World Monuments Fund Watch List. Alabama has a rich and incredible history that not only changed the country but the world! We must preserve the past to protect our future. https://t.co/SP7w2buVbgMy constituents have been waiting TOO LONG for trickle down economics to trickle down to them!! I questioned Mnuchin about why the #TrumpBudget cuts programs for low-income areas but the #GOPTaxScam gives away $1.5 trillion in tax benefits to corporations and special interests. https://t.co/RnWcZOLur5You still do not get it @realDonaldTrump. Russia attacked our democracy. This is about our sovereignty and our right to vote in fair elections. We must hold Russia accountable. https://t.co/r6IAdSbBDEIn line with what our Committee has found, Mueller's indictment shows that Russia specifically targeted minority voters in a campaign to remove them from the political process. https://t.co/bUZw2pr4gKThe foreign actors who interfered in our elections MUST be held accountable. As a country, we have to send a message: attacks on our democracy will not be tolerated. https://t.co/fgzA1dC4fdToday we the AKA Members of Congress, join with our international president Dorothy Buckhanan Wilson for a reception for a US postal stamp! #SheDeservesAStamp  #AlphaKappaAlpha https://t.co/NvmTDuLtWxToday I voted against the GOP bill to roll back the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Handicapped rights are civil rights and we must ensure every American has access to our public spaces. #HR620 #HandsOffMyADAFor 16 years my Dad was wheelchair bound, and I remember how important it was that our public spaces were handicapped accessible. I remember how we had to carry him into the local courthouse so he could register to vote for his own daughter. #HR620 #HandsOffMyADA https://t.co/cmeJVro25qI have always been a strong proponent of the Second Amendment, but Congress can no longer settle for symbolic gestures when gun violence kills more Americans every day.Americans are tired of Congress’s inaction and silent acceptance of the status quo in the face of gun violence. The time for action, the time to strengthen background checks and ban bump stocks and close the gun show loophole, is now.This is not our nation's first school shooting, it is the 239th such shooting since Sandy Hook. There is an epidemic of gun violence in America, and every day Congress fails to address this epidemic, more students, more teachers, more parents and brothers and sisters are killed.My heart goes out to the victims, their families, and to the #Parkland community. Our schools should be places where our children are loved and kept safe. When classrooms are turned into crime scenes, when our students are terrorized by guns, something has gone horribly wrong.The #TrumpBudget cuts Medicare by $554 billion and Medicaid by $1.4 trillion. We cannot let this Administration break their promise to the American people. https://t.co/5rigyy6VdYHonored to pay tribute to Frederick Douglass for his 200th birthday today!! “If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” Still true today as the day Douglass spoke it! https://t.co/VgWTWx83C9Can't wait for this weekend's Congressional Art Competition! Join me at the Selma Interpretive Center on Saturday, Feb. 17, from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM and check out the artistic work presented by high school students in our district. Great submissions this year! https://t.co/qQ6ixCRAC6Today, women in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, came together for #AmericanHeartMonth. 1 in 3 women are  living with heart disease or stroke, and #WearRedDay is about highlighting the challenges they face and the work we have left to do tackling heart disease. https://t.co/gMxX6G8k7pAs we listen to the Health and Human Services Secretary try to defend Trump's massive cuts to programs supporting working families, it's become clear that there's nothing healthy or humane about this HHS #budget. @WaysMeansCmteThe #TrumpBudget is a complete moral failure. How can we cut Medicare by $500 billion, Medicaid by $1.4 trillion when our rural hospitals are closing? Today in the @WaysMeansCmte, I'm calling on Trump's HHS Secretary for answers. https://t.co/zS46mftCUOAs we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, I shared my memories of Shirley Chisholm with @USATODAY . She's one of my biggest #sheroes, so proud to be a part of this tribute:
https://t.co/XG2RnmQ5h0Honored today to serve on a panel with Alabama business owner Jeff @mcdowellsecure on the importance of small business! So proud of Jeff for graduating from @GS10KSmallBiz!! Great job!! https://t.co/yFfor8EgdMToday, Louis' 12 year reign as the Heavy Weight Champion of the World is still a record.  #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/sLJkbOJ21zLouis also helped to desegregate the game of Golf in America and became the first African American to play a PGA Tour event. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/zxJSE3MZlpWidely regarded as one of America's first black sports heroes, Louis fought for our country in World War II, despite military segregation. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/4A3D1eslTrToday for #BlackHistoryMonth I'm proud to recognize World Heavy Weight Champion boxer Joe Louis, an Alabamian hero who shaped the discussion of race in our country. Born Joseph Louis Barrow, Louis was nicknamed the “Brown Bomber” because of his 52 career knockout victories. https://t.co/RWChYStpeJA beautiful tribute to a great President and First Lady. So excited to see their official portraits. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/EKak3rwK9PGreat day visit with the Selma City Council today! Great to be back home! https://t.co/7YmjdB4928Make no mistake, if the #TrumpBudget becomes law, more Alabamians will go homeless, more children will go hungry, and more families will go uninsured. All in order to pay for Trump's #GOPTaxScam.
