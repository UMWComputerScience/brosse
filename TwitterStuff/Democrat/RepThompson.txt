(2/3)Today, I visited a facility that houses children separated from their families as a result of the Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. They faced unimaginable horrors and the trauma of that journey is only perpetuated the longer they are separated from their families. (1/3)Today’s #SCOTUS ruling is an attack on our unions that undermines public-sector workers like teachers and police officers.

I called on the Speaker to stop supporting the President’s harmful immigration tactics and allow a vote on immigration bills like the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act and the #DreamAct to end these practices. https://t.co/sTr7wUlEOQThe Mare Island Cemetery must be restored and maintained as a haven for our fallen veterans buried there.

It ignores kids already separated from parents and it requires children arriving from today on to be incarcerated, leaving lasting harmful trauma and costing the taxpayer. We must pass bipartisan immigration reform now.Joined my colleagues to demand the President end his cruel and inhumane policy that leaves families separated at the border. Democrats introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act that reverses this policy. I am demanding the Speaker hold a vote immediately. https://t.co/ovqQaIiKmoThe President is losing some of his staunchest supporters, the religious right, and rightly so. Separating families is cruel, inhumane, and contrary to family values. https://t.co/oiVR2EHQMgThe president is the one who created this directive, he could reverse it at any time, and he should do so immediately.

Thanks to all who turned out! https://t.co/gbEOwzTWM1This rule doesn't address underlying drivers of rising premiums, it'll just exacerbate costs by allowing junk plans that don’t cover essential services and discriminate based on age/gender/occupation. This is merely another attempt to sabotage the ACA https://t.co/0NMiJXOHTnAgain today I cannot stop thinking of the photos and sounds of scared children ripped from their parents at the border.

This is unacceptable and threatens access to health care for millions. https://t.co/Y5AqmAgP3dWe had a compromise to protect Dreamers led by Reps. Aguilar and Hurd that was strongly backed by Dems and Republicans. GOP leadership rejected that bill and are basically telling Dreamers and moderate Republicans to take a hike. Incredibly disappointing. https://t.co/tKepBoRHarI am humbled to have the support of the @AmericanLegion for my bill to transfer control of the cemetery from Vallejo to the VA. This will allow the grounds to be restored.
