Families belong together. I join tens of thousands of people all across the nation in affirming that message to the Administration. The lack of a plan to reunite families is egregious. This is why we speak out. This is why we march. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarchThe Republican tax scam "‚Ä¶that was supposed to raise wages and spur hiring has instead funded a record stock buyback and dividend spree, benefiting investors and company executives over workers."

My full statement:

https://t.co/gEWUSi4ILsIn the wealthiest nation on earth a preexisting condition shouldn‚Äôt disqualify you or your loved ones from having quality, affordable health care.

Tariffs should be imposed on China unless and until they agree to reform their trading relationship with the US, allow for a level-playing field, &amp; stop stealing our tech. 

https://t.co/1JRH40zo5a"Chinese tariffs will still be relatively high, however, and the change is unlikely to motivate automakers to shift production away from China." This is not winning. President Trump and his Administration's willingness to cave to China is hurting America. https://t.co/5hp0OhElulRepublicans' non-stop efforts to sabotage of the ACA are having a negative impact on health care premiums in 2019. An analysis finds that premiums will increase an average $1,013 nationally, and $800 for Ohioans, specifically. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/pMVDJ8CLKbAmen!  Find common ground and how we can come together, not constantly try to divide us by race, class, gender or sexual orientation. https://t.co/zk21cRYlwCOne very good reason (of many) that last weeks farm bill defeat was welcomed. That said ‚Äî America‚Äôs farmers and food system are too important for the GOP to be playing games with. https://t.co/OAWf1Wzp9XAnother example the Trump Administration's ongoing attack on women's health care. Each day @realDonaldTrump is moving this country backwards. #NoGagRule https://t.co/lDvhgIskgPYou're Invited! On Tuesday May 29th, I will be hosting a Town Hall in Youngstown, Ohio. Doors open at 5PM. Have your questions ready and come on down. https://t.co/JnRNxkCDaKOur kids shouldn‚Äôt have to be subjected to this trauma again and again and again. Don‚Äôt tell me now is not the time to talk about ways we can stop this. It is already too late for another school, another community. My thoughts and prayers are with them. We must do something. https://t.co/oJutlkzYFKClassic 

https://t.co/DMJjjjWfirGreat to have you! https://t.co/TqlcNfeAXhCuts to #SNAP would be devastating to low-income families, rural grocers and farmers' markets. Roughly 265,000 low-income kids will lose access to meals at school because of the hyper-partisan #GOPFarmBill. We must #ProtectSNAP.There isn‚Äôt a more deserving recipient! Congratulations to Mayor Horrigan on this well deserved recognition. Akron is fortunate to have your leadership. https://t.co/Wh6L3QsqA5On the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia, we renew our commitment to supporting and protecting LGBTQ rights. No matter who you love or how you identify, we all deserve to live in this world free of discrimination and hatred. #IDAHOTBRather than moving the needle of our country‚Äôs food system in a direction that promotes sustainable farming practices, emerging local and organic farms, urban agriculture, conservation practices, and specialty crops, the #GOPFarmBill takes us backwards. https://t.co/brrN2PhaXDWe are hurting our country and our children‚Äôs future.  Focus Mr. President. We are not winning! https://t.co/qiYN3p7ckxI had the pleasure of speaking with 14-year-old @wufshanti creator, Adam, about how I incorporate mindfulness not only in my own life, but in Congress as well. Check it out below: https://t.co/hGYidIgf50Huge win. Gotta keep the pressure on to get it through the House. Don‚Äôt give up the fight! #NetNeutrality https://t.co/ck9huslBgz.@realDonaldTrump is too caught up in his own chaotic 24 hour news cycle to develop a long term plan for China. It puts us and our allies at risk. https://t.co/qiYN3p7ckxThe time is now. Senate Democrats will vote to #SaveTheInternet later today. #NetNeutrality protects innovators and small businesses by ensuring they have a level playing field online. I'm proud to support similar net neutrality legislation here in the house.I am proud to have played my part in securing this funding for YARS and Camp Ravenna. Investing in the men and women who serve our country goes a long way in protecting our national security. https://t.co/UMsNWCltHjI spoke on @Morning_Joe today about President Trump's bad deal with China on ZTE. He's focused more on bringing jobs back to China than he is to the United States. And he's ignoring the intelligence community on the national security threats about ZTE. https://t.co/2R76aX74JLToday, @SenateDems are spearheading an effort to force a vote on defending #NetNeutrality to preserve the internet as we know it. I‚Äôm with them. https://t.co/Oztqh70fffTune in! https://t.co/DzCg2vX7rKIf anyone's curious about how much American national security costs, it's $500 million. The ZTE lifeline is only about one thing: Trump enriching himself. I guess it's Trump First, China Second, America Third. https://t.co/wB8btPL8RrDuring National Police Week, and especially today on Peace Officers Memorial Day, we honor the law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty. We will never forget their sacrifice. Thank you to the men and women who serve today and keep our communities safe. https://t.co/hJdTlhXiV2This is so sad and so heartening at the same time.  üôèüèª to all those who serve as first responders AND their families.  This is what community is all about. https://t.co/KLj0EDysnEAmen!  And collective action is needed to assure these families have health care, child care, homes and water without lead, good schools, safe neighborhoods and opportunity to secure wealth. Prayers then action! https://t.co/89qovufMj4üëáüèΩ https://t.co/W0tYbZ3hCVMore of my thoughts here: https://t.co/iGXQKrZkfMNever mind that ZTE is a company with which the NSA, FBI, and CIA all have cyber security concerns. The Pentagon even stopped selling its phones on military bases.GM Lordstown has lost 2,700 jobs over the last 18 months &amp; hasn‚Äôt earned a single tweet from POTUS. Chinese telecom giant  ZTE, however, is getting VIP treatment from the Real Donald Trump himself who is working overtime to, in his own words, ‚Äòget [zte] back into business, fast.‚Äô https://t.co/Vn3HuG8anQWhen it comes to for-profit colleges cheating students, we know where Secretary @BetsyDeVosED stands. Her actions are shameful and does nothing to help students. https://t.co/sMY95ijWrIOn top of that, the NSA, FBI, and CIA all have cyber security concerns with ZTE. The Pentagon even stopped selling its phones in its bases. Your willingness to throw a lifeline to ZTE and China puts our national security at risk. What happened to America First?Hey @RealDonaldTrump -- I've got 1,500 auto workers that are laid off at GM in Lordstown, OH. Not one tweet, not one comment from your office. Remember Ohio? The place you campaigned and told people how trade and China were destroying our middle class? https://t.co/eUVH45fNX7Officer Leo and his family are in my thoughts today. As are all the brave officers who serve in the line of duty every single day ‚Äî especially those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. https://t.co/x7K5TX223NSenate must pass my HOT CARS Act now! The longer we wait, the more children we will lose. We can save many babies from suffering horrible deaths by requiring car companies to install very cheap and very simple software. No need for this to ever happen. https://t.co/4aaJwruQN7Trump betrayed the voters (again). While patients are struggling with high drug prices, Trump hired a Big Pharma president to run HHS and now he‚Äôs breaking his campaign promise to allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices. https://t.co/xG6YSkv8F6Student loan debt has skyrocketed to $1.5 trillion. It's outrageous that Mick Mulvaney is eliminating the office that protects student from predatory lenders. This is not how you help students. https://t.co/aQ0T7Dx3lhI promised Nellie ice cream to celebrate her award, so I had to settle up! Congratulations again, Nellie. You‚Äôre an inspiration to me and many. Thank you for your service to our nation. https://t.co/1yImW2xw4YThe Lordstown Planning Commission voted unanimously to rezone the land where TJX will build its distribution center. We're making progress! https://t.co/3yFBnqkqtSI'm proud to have secured $16.2 million funding for YARS and Camp Ravenna. The men and women who serve our community are the best and brightest. It's our responsibility to give them the resources they need to protect and serve Northeast Ohio and the U.S. https://t.co/ZMfXXPnbTXThis funding is necessary for Congress to carry out its constitutional duties. 

Director Mulvaney should turn his calls for spending restraint toward the Trump Administration‚Äôs mounting spending scandals involving the obscene waste of taxpayer money. 

https://t.co/biCU8CL6Ct@donomom54 @wilberforce_u You bet!#ProtectTheNet https://t.co/mzh8y68WdMWonderful meeting with President Pinkard of @wilberforce_u today! A wonderful institution doing great work. https://t.co/kQG51XUvpJWithout #netneutrality, broadband companies can block and throttle internet traffic or charge companies and consumers more for certain content. I'm fighting for a free and open internet and am proud to support legislation that will protect net neutrality and #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/tReg97Nn2DTaking action to support teacher health and well-being is necessary for a productive school environment. It's why I introduced the Teacher Health and Wellness Act which aims to identify solutions in reducing teacher stress and increasing teacher retention. https://t.co/7xSACteAI7From funding the House Wounded Warriors program to the Capitol Police, today's Legislative Branch Appropriations bill ensures that the House continues to operate smoothly and follows through with its priorities. Read my full statement below: https://t.co/B2mI8APX2TBy withdrawing from the Iran deal, the President is committing an egregious national security miscalculation rooted in politics, not fact. He is signaling to the world that the United States is not leading with a steady hand. https://t.co/oHIHRw6qp1Happy to be with my friends in the @MachinistsUnion for their legislative conference this morning. If we want to rebuild a robust middle class, we‚Äôre going to need a thriving labor movement! Thanks for all you do. #UnionStrong https://t.co/iEA6L2jSB9It was a privilege and honor to meet Nellie Beach. She became a certified underwater welder during WWII, working on military barges and ships. And at 109 years young, she is going strong. Thank you for your service and allowing me to recognize your legacy. https://t.co/v0tBtpSrInOur teachers go above and beyond for their students. They spend countless nights and weekends preparing for class, ready to teach the next generation of leaders, artists and scientists. We in Congress and state legislatures must do better to support them. #TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/thraXhgtAeThank you for your leadership!  Let‚Äôs finish the job! https://t.co/ti9maBUkDnI don‚Äôt even know what to say!

After a lot of hard work and support from local economic development agencies, state/local electeds, civic leaders, and my office, TJX Homegood's has decided to stay in Lordstown.While the President has been busy dividing us and dealing with his own scandals, China has been quietly getting to work in the South China Sea. We need focused leadership. https://t.co/wB6RLZSNgyToday, we remember the four lives lost at Kent State University 48 years ago. As the university dedicates the site of this tragedy as a National Historic Landmark, let it be a reminder of how important protest is to our democracy and 1st Amendment rights. https://t.co/ws5ek21i2L.@CDCgov study found 8% of deaths were associated with inadequate levels of physical activity. It underscores the need for the ENRICH Act. A bill I introduced that expands physical activity and nutrition curriculum at medical schools for our doctors. https://t.co/hBM42zFaYU.@RealDonaldTrump likes to believe he's breaking records.

So much for being fiscally responsible. https://t.co/kHlzJr2XtQMay marks Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.

And America must do better at accountability. This should have never happened to Ohio-native Desmond Marrow. #BlackLivesMatterThis is inexcusable and profoundly upsetting. Examples of this violence at the hands of some law enforcement officers whose job it is to protect us have become all too common in our country.

You signed an order this week limiting the use of science and continue to block efforts to combat climate change. To top it all off, you've wasted millions of taxpayer money. You are not fit to run the EPA. https://t.co/tHLmgCMyJETrump's travel ban is an affront to American principles.

I've said it once and I'll say it again, Democrats are ready to craft a bipartisan bill that benefits everyone. https://t.co/Gr9C0gOKdRToday, I urged GM to consider the ShareWork Ohio program for employees impacted by the Lordstown layoffs. It takes an outside-the-box approach to retaining valued employees until GM rightly gets the second-shift back up and running. https://t.co/rlXA4ZdRtlThe VA Department is the second-largest federal agency.

Big corporations. A majority of the money saved from the tax scam is going to shareholders and stock buybacks instead of employees. It's plain and simple, Republicans have left behind hard-working families. #TaxDayI‚Äôve made it a priority to advocate for a more robust, comprehensive #FarmBill that fixes our broken food system from top to bottom. Congress has that opportunity this year, but under Republican-control that opportunity is already being squandered.

https://t.co/94Unr2ABjo3/ I am proud that my bill, the Healthy Start Reauthorization Act, supports this life-saving work.2/ We must redouble our efforts to combat this trend by confronting bias wherever it is, and through programs like Healthy Start, which is fighting maternal and infant mortality with early prenatal care, quality services, and postpartum home visiting.1/ Read this article.

Shirley was the first African American woman elected to Congress, and used her position to advocate for working people and fair labor and housing standards among many things. Shining example of service. https://t.co/RLHK1XCDFhThe use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians is a crime against humanity. If Assad is guilty of this heinous attack, he must be held accountable by the U.S. and our allies. https://t.co/pBkhVPvuGdStopped by the Choffin Career &amp; Technical Center to check out some of the amazing tech education programming at work. Watching some student projects being 3D printed on the spot! https://t.co/DcuTVgs6laCelebrating üíØ Years of the Youngstown Foundation. Thank you for a century of dedicated service to our community ‚Äî looking forward to a century more! https://t.co/m67uAB2SFuIn today's world, this is an important idea to keep in our heads. There are more friendly people than hostile ones in the world. We just need to see each other. https://t.co/j7xvhyhcgsIt's finally here. Home opener for the @Indians. Let's do this! #RallyTogether https://t.co/x2NhNdQHZr.@PortageAreaRTA will receive a $2.6 million grant from @FTA_DOT to fund the construction of an indoor storage facility. It's important we continue to invest in our transportation services that Ohioans rely on every day. Congrats to PARTA on this grant.  https://t.co/UWgXXverKmIf the President were as interested in securing our borders as he is in self-aggrandizing publicity stunts, then he‚Äôd let the experts dictate where investments are needed to efficiently and affordably accomplish our border security goals. https://t.co/wkWmupQVdlWe face serious threats from countries undermining our democracy. Instead of taking strategic, deliberate steps to protect our nation, Trump pulls our National Guard away from their important work to parade them around the border for political purposes. This is not leadership. https://t.co/5CNxfwMQ4HPresident Trump and his Administration don't understand the future of the economy or American manufacturing. Ohio is ranked 2nd in light vehicle models, and the EPA's decision to target Light-Duty Vehicle standards puts the auto industry and 95,000 Ohio jobs at risk. https://t.co/VFXHruYPW0The Trump Administration's attack on American manufacturing is setting Ohio back and putting GM Lordstown at risk. The current vehicle standards save consumers money, create thousands of manufacturing jobs, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. https://t.co/21gLsPPWYhDr. Martin Luther King Jr. was struck down by hate 50 years ago today. His passion, courage, and dedication to break barriers and build bridges is an inspiration. We can honor his life by continuing his legacy and staying focused on creating a more equal and just society. #MLK50 https://t.co/kQhfNF1haY.@KingJames has proven time and time again that he's a champion on and off the court. He understands that politics and sports are not mutually exclusive. Thank you for using your voice to speak out against racial injustice. https://t.co/SX1KC6AjWmAs co-chair of the Maker Caucus, the potential and application of 3-D printing never fails to amaze me - paving the way for cost- and time-effective constructed buildings. https://t.co/KSPJJ5dPyKGreat piece from my friend @roybahat on his experience with our Comeback Cities Tour. I look forward to cultivating the relationships between coastal VC's and our local startup community. The Midwest is the prefect place for investment with it's untapped ingenuity and resources. https://t.co/tXHMw4avb0September 5, 2017: You ended DACA.

Since then, you‚Äôve consistently demonstrated that you‚Äôre not serious about passing immigration reform by rejecting every possible bipartisan deal. 

Your reckless behavior put us in this mess. https://t.co/PLqootUwsqHappy Easter, everyone! Wishing you all a wonderful day with family and friends.Chag Sameach to all those celebrating #Passover. Wishing you and your family a happy Passover!Wow...Happy Easter Ted!  Amazing Christian values. I‚Äôm sure Jesus is very proud of you and relies on your judgement of who may have a soul or not. https://t.co/vbWGRPMFmgHappy to rep my Akron pride.  #330ShirtDay https://t.co/euINsZRlmC@hughhewitt @mikeallen @axios 12:30pm. I'm buying.‚ÄúI absolutely believe the way Amer‚Äôs case was handled by the Trump administration was intended to publicly humiliate [him] and his family for exercising their right to free speech. It is despicable,‚Äù said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who advocated against Adi‚Äôs deportation. https://t.co/VUZAEddctJ
