It was an honor to meet with you all and hear Charlie and your family’s story. Thank you for your advocacy — it is absolutely critical. https://t.co/fMC1y24g25Thankful for our summer interns and all their hard work in my DC office! https://t.co/Z2NcseWPfbThe targeting of journalists in Annapolis is heartbreaking, &amp; thoughts &amp; prayers are still not enough. We have to do more to try prevent gun violence.

Congress must act on commonsense gun safety reforms. If one life is saved, that’s progress. It’s long past time to unite on thisVoted NO on HR6136 today. Bill fails to properly #ProtectDREAMers, leaves Trump admin’s 0-tolerance policy &amp; indefinite family detention in place, eliminates diversity visa lottery, restricts family-based immigration &amp; wastes US taxpayer $ on a border wall. Time for commonsense.Congratulations to our @VetAffairsDems Staff Director Ray Kelley on being recognized by @DAVHQ for his commitment to — and success in — helping fulfill our promises to those who served, their families and their survivors. Thank you for your tireless service, Ray. https://t.co/gFI0V9WIMpThree years ago, marriage equality rightfully became the law of the land. As we celebrate this monumental achievement for equality, let #PrideMonth also remind us of the hard work we have ahead to continue moving #EqualityForward, including passing the #EqualityAct. #Pride https://t.co/j9DmKMpLzGRepublicans in Washington put millionaires, billionaires and corporations over working-class Americans. This is the result of the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/Bzin0eK2BJI’ve worked w/ @15thSMA on this for yrs on behalf of @MNNationalGuard members. As a result of this tuition assistance change, #USArmy Guard Soldiers will now be able to tap their education benefits immediately after AIT &amp; basic training. Good move @USArmy! https://t.co/oJXN7ff3kZ.@realDonaldTrump’s #TravelBan is a serious attack on religious freedom in America. Today’s Supreme Court decision does not reflect our American values. https://t.co/liIdT7tJxOPassing legislation to grant presumptive #AgentOrange exposure status to #BlueWaterNavy #veterans has been one of my highest priorities since arriving to Congress. Yesterday, the House finally passed such legislation. https://t.co/5noAlduVEbIn all 21 counties of #MN01, I’ve heard calls for increasing investment in rural areas from workforce housing to infrastructure — not for eliminating @usdaRD. Yet, that is virtually what @realDonaldTrump and @MickMulvaneyOMB’s “reorganization” plan does, and it’s unacceptable.5 yrs ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision.

To #RestoreTheVOTE and ensure our elections are fair, I call on Congress to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act. I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of this vital legislation. https://t.co/OQBM7eqDJARacial and partisan #gerrymandering have no place in our democracy. To #RestoreTheVOTE, we must put an end to this anti-democratic practice once and for all. https://t.co/S29KeeTyWzProud to join @DrPhilRoe in announcing a new subcommittee focusing on IT projects at @DeptVetAffairs. Now, Congress will be better suited to hold VA accountable as the department modernizes its antiquated electronic health record and IT systems. https://t.co/RGUhaWQu03We must do more to support conservation, invest in small-town businesses and rural communities, provide opportunities to beginning farmers and ranchers, and protect and strengthen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (#SNAP).

The #GOPFarmBill doesn’t cut it. #FarmBill18 https://t.co/g2noGCpNMPI voted NO on the #GOPFarmBill because it abandons our farmers, consumers, veterans and vulnerable families with children. #FarmBill18 #FarmBill

Read my full statement: https://t.co/yBWg9WLNgNWe must #ProtectDREAMers and #KeepFamiliesTogether. It’s a shame the @HouseGOP is once again choosing radical partisanship over compassionate commonsense.

Read my statement in opposition to the Republican anti-family, anti-immigrant bills HR6136 and HR4760: https://t.co/Yu3WVjSqs1I vehemently oppose President Trump’s rollback of protections for the Great Lakes. I will do everything in my power to prevent the giveaway of our cherished natural treasures. https://t.co/nEmxGLFVp0Exciting to see Congressional Art Competition art up in the Capitol this AM! https://t.co/fuS2sp7UXTI am heartened by the many Americans who have raised their voices to object to the horrific policy of separating families. We need to keep raising them. Our work is far from finished. The children &amp; families still separated need us to keep holding this Administration accountable.In a shocking letter to VA Inspector General Missal, Acting Secretary O’Rourke threatened the independence of VA’s most central accountability and ethics watchdog. Such behavior undermines veterans' best interest and is not reflective of a person fit for leadership in government. https://t.co/5iriC5zNJz96.6% of the calls and emails my office has received on the Trump admin’s family separation policy have been in opposition to it. 

I hear you loud and clear, and I stand with you against this violation of human rights. Thank you for speaking out, #MN01. #KeepFamiliesTogetherSince June 22, 1944, hundreds of thousands of vets have put themselves through college thanks to the #GIBill, including myself. I’m proud to join @DrPhilRoe in introducing a resolution to designate the week of June 18, 2018 as Nat’l GI Bill Commemoration Week! #NationalGIBillWeekI’ve cosponsored the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to put an end to the Trump administration’s morally unacceptable family separation policy. It’s our responsibility as Americans to stand up together for our shared values.This is exactly why I authored the STOCK Act. To restore the public trust, Secretary Ross should resign and be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law we passed to protect our democracy. Public officials shouldn’t profit from their position.
https://t.co/7rvl8FjMzQSeeking refuge from war, violence, oppression, and hunger is what brought so many of our ancestors to our shores. We must live our values and be a beacon of hope for those yearning to breathe free. #WorldRefugeeDay #WithRefugeesI’m proud to introduce the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act with @RepJerryNadler, @HouseJudDems and over 190 @HouseDemocrats.

This bill will end the Trump administration’s inhumane practice of separating children from their parents at the border. #HumanRights #FamiliesBelongTogetherIt should surprise no one that a president who praises North Korea’s murderous tyrant also oversees the inhumane separation of families at the border — but it should outrage us all. 

End this madness, @realDonaldTrump. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/PgDYU7NqSYNot only is Sec. Nielsen misleading the American people, but the policy of separating families at the border is an affront to our moral values as a nation.

.@SecNielsen should resign immediately — and I’ll say it again: the buck stops with @realDonaldTrump. #KeepFamiliesTogetherIn September 2017, I wrote the US Government Accountability Office requesting a full review of long term care at VA nursing homes, and GAO accepted. I urge GAO to make the thorough and timely completion of this review a top priority.

My letter to @USGAO: https://t.co/MCgDwmHTsQVets and their loved ones deserve real accountability and transparency at VA, and that is why I am calling on VA to make all nursing home data, especially key quality indicators such as rates of injury and infection, available to the public immediately. https://t.co/kHFwvdVLbAWidespread underperformance at VA nursing homes is a betrayal of veterans’ trust and wellbeing. @DeptVetAffairs concealing this data from the public until news stories were about to be filed makes matters infinitely worse.

Stmt on VA nursing home ratings: https://t.co/im8EEyyv7e https://t.co/1577HQeQXm133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions are protected under the ACA, including over 2 million in MN. If the Trump administration succeeds, folks living with cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes or a mental health condition will lose these vital protections. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/thYYWNbHUIOur government is violating the human rights of children and the buck stops with @realDonaldTrump.

The president has the power to immediately end his administration’s immoral practice of separating children from their parents at the border. Why hasn’t he? #FamiliesBelongTogetherProud to join @RepMaloney and 100+ @HouseDemocrats &amp; @SenateDems to submit an amicus brief today in support of a lawsuit to block the @realDonaldTrump administration’s unconstitutional plan to add a citizenship question to the #2020census. We must ensure that #everyonecounts.As we mark the 6th anniversary of #DACA, we renew our commitment to protecting the over 6k MN #Dreamers whose future in the US remains in limbo due to inaction by Republican leaders in Washington.

Republicans and Democrats both want to #ProtectDreamers. Let’s get it done. https://t.co/mBmVZsv6l0.@realDonaldTrump is emboldening a tyrant that murders his own people and endangering the security of our nation and our allies. Plain and simple. https://t.co/0fDo29qXA3Wishing all our Soldiers a very special #USArmy birthday today! We are so grateful for the sacrifices you and your families make so that we may live free.

And hey, you don’t look a day over 150, @USArmy! #ArmyBDay https://t.co/zJNMUN7RntSent a letter alongside @RepCummings and @OversightDems calling on @realDonaldTrump to rescind three Executive Orders that target whistleblowers by stripping federal employees of critical protections.

Proud to stand up and fight for workers. Full letter: https://t.co/e7QGxVTB6RI’ve saluted many times in my life. This sure as hell wouldn’t have been one. Awful. https://t.co/t5JPKEf3lVInstead of compromising our moral values as a nation by tearing children out of the hands of their parents, why don’t we practice some compassionate commonsense?
 
It’s time for Republicans to stand up to President Trump and work with Democrats on real immigration reform. https://t.co/ULTmTU2SmnBy separating children from their parents at the border, the Trump administration is violating their human rights.
 
We must call this cruel practice out for what it is: child abuse.
 
I have joined Rep. @rosadelauro on a resolution condemning this inhumane and immoral policy.Make no mistake, Republicans in Washington continue to threaten Americans’ access to affordable health care.

They’re still trying to tear down protections for folks with #preexistingconditions and take away #Medicaid coverage from Minnesota families.

We must #ProtectOurCare.The #ChildCare for #WorkingFamilies Act creates affordable &amp; flexible care options for families including day-long #summercare options, ensures a safe &amp; high-quality environment for learning, &amp; supports the professionals who care for our children. I’m proud to cosponsor the bill. https://t.co/rh9oKRYBjsPer @CAPEarlyEd, the typical MN family spends about 12% of their 3-month summer income to cover just 5 weeks of summer #childcare.
 
This assumes #summercare programming is even available and within reach, which is not always a reality for many of our rural families.Couldn’t be more relieved #mprraccoon is safe and sound. 🙏 Was starting to have flashbacks to Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls... 😢 https://t.co/rJQI2A4kkn#TPS holders have lived in the US legally for years.

That’s why I support the American Promise Act &amp; ASPIRE-TPS Act. https://t.co/zaOyj5XC09The Trump Administration is still trying to take health care away from the over 2 million Minnesotans with #preexistingconditions.

Video: https://t.co/atd7jc2a5AWhether it’s preventing disruptions in veteran care, protecting veteran privacy, or ensuring taxpayer dollars are invested responsibly, the Veterans’ #EHR Modernization Oversight Act will make sure Congress has the power to keep VA’s EHR modernization on track &amp; in line. #HR4245 https://t.co/IS0YEjJ00OI commend the House for passing the Vets’ Electronic Health Record Modernization Oversight Act today, a bill I wrote to ensure Congress has the tools it needs to effectively oversee VA’s $16 billion #EHR modernization effort.

Congress needs this oversight authority ASAP. #HR4245 https://t.co/XHU2C7vjuaI’m honored to join in thanking the service members from each branch of our Armed Forces and their families for the sacrifices they make every day. #ArmedForcesDay https://t.co/4RJ0rtFYrWI have serious concerns regarding Robert Wilkie’s judgment given his role in the Trump administration’s ban on #transtroops. Our vets need a VA Secretary that is going to care for all our heroes including #transvets.Instead of working to lower costs &amp; improve care, this admin is obsessed w/ attacking women’s right to control their own healthcare.

@realDonaldTrump needs to stop demonizing women’s personal choices &amp; focus on improving healthcare access &amp; affordability for all. #ProtectTitleX https://t.co/gXwQBE5aspPlanned Parenthood serves 68k Minnesotans every year, and has provided care for over 30 million people nationwide, including 1 in 5 women.

@realDonaldTrump’s new attack on #TitleX impedes access to all kinds of care, from cancer screenings to STD testing. https://t.co/sjYQMMSrcxBefore Mr. Wilkie is confirmed, the Senate must ensure he has the character &amp; skillset necessary to bring stability to @DeptVetAffairs. Improving the lives of vets must always be his top priority &amp; he should never let politics distract him from faithfully executing VA’s mission.#cleanenergy like wind, biofuel, sun &amp; biomass are abundant in rural areas. They help provide affordable energy options 4 our communities &amp; save our rural businesses $ through energy efficiency &amp; #renewable options.

So why does the @HouseGOP #FarmBill eliminate the Energy Title?2 million people will have their access to food threatened if the @HouseGOP passes their hyper-partisan #FarmBill.

That’s beyond unjust.

We should strengthen and #ProtectSNAP — the most effective anti-hunger program in US history — not put Americans at risk of going hungry.Sleeper: SPAM Sprinters https://t.co/KoRs9BnVeEBy eliminating funding for #FarmBill energy programs, the @HouseGOP is taking away valuable tools for our farmers and ranchers to improve their operations, become more efficient, and weather the downturn in the rural economy more easily.

This is simply unacceptable.As more American workers are laid off &amp; jobs are shipped overseas following the #GOPTaxScam payback to corporate donors, @realDonaldTrump is bailing out a Chinese company after China agreed to invest $500 million in a project that will make Trump even richer.

This is corruption. https://t.co/0yqX0XbGwr#FarmBill energy programs have helped advance the bioeconomy, created value-added opportunities for producers, developed advanced biofuels, and saved rural Americans millions on their energy bills.

The @HouseGOP #2018FarmBill puts all that progress at risk.The details of this report are disturbing &amp; unacceptable. It also underscores why Congressional oversight in this process is so critical.

I’ve advocated for DoD/VA electronic health record interoperability for years now. It’s time to pass the VA #EHR Modernization Oversight Act. https://t.co/5Y5Ipi5YgV#FarmBill energy programs play an essential role in our rural economy, helping to create thousands of jobs.

Yet, the @HouseGOP #2018FarmBill completely eliminates the Energy Title, which will mean more expenses for rural communities if it becomes law.Today in Minnesota, we honor our Hmong and Lao veterans for their service and sacrifice. I’m proud to have supported the effort to allow burials for these heroic #secretwar veterans in US national cemeteries.

Thank you for all you’ve done for this country.The @realDonaldTrump era &amp; Putin’s attack on our electoral process have made it crystal clear why Congress needs to pass the Political Intelligence Transparency Act.

Tragedies like this must end. We need to get answers from @DeptVetAffairs so we know exactly how this happened, how to prevent similar tragedies, and save veteran lives. https://t.co/az3R8oVuqAI’m not sure what makes me angrier: when Republicans claim the #GOPTaxScam puts workers first or those rare moments when they tell the truth and admit it’s a pay-back to their corporate donors. One thing is clear, it’s not working for the working class. @MachinistsUnion https://t.co/jnNO7Vc1qZLaborers have our back. It’s about time Congress has theirs.

It’s time for @DeptVetAffairs to finally #dotheresearch so our vets get the answers on #medicalcannabis they deserve.

I call on @SpeakerRyan to bring this bipartisan bill to the Floor for a vote ASAP.By authorizing @DeptVetAffairs to advance scientific and medical research into the safety and efficacy of #cannabis usage by vets living with post-traumatic stress disorder (#PTSD) and #chronicpain, the VA #MedicinalCannabis Research Act answers the call of over 92% of our vets. https://t.co/v25FtHCLXNI applaud my @HouseVetAffairs and @VetAffairsDems colleagues for advancing the VA Medicinal #Cannabis Research Act out of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs today!

Thank you for 28 years of service to this nation. https://t.co/WD4jWmyTBSCongratulations @RepTomEmmer for winning this year’s MN Congressional Delegation Annual Hotdish Competition! https://t.co/i0x5I9OOGHThe annual bipartisan Minnesota Congressional Delegation Hotdish Competition always brings out smiles! https://t.co/gMLwL3PnlXWelcome @EmmanuelMacron to  the People’s House. The bonds that bind our nations are rooted in defense of human rights. https://t.co/DXF7mVu2n0Getting ready to listen to @EmmanuelMacron address a joint session of Congress. https://t.co/BJ1zM8IySDThank you @MichelMcQMartin for having me on @npratc last night! Improving the lives of #vets should always be a non-partisan issue. I’m proud to be working w/ colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass the #bipartisan VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act. https://t.co/z8rKCPzSbQ#ClimateChange increases air pollution, the spread of disease and extreme weather events such as heat waves and severe storms. Yet @realDonaldTrump’s @fema has stopped preparing for the disastrous impacts of climate change? Indefensible! #EarthDay https://t.co/3Wgk1onAkTMinnesotans care deeply about the environment because it’s a matter of health and safety.

@realDonaldTrump’s @EPA budget would cut the agency by 23% and slash environmental justice enforcement by 70%, which would decrease access to clean air and water. Unacceptable! #EarthDayOn #EarthDay18 we recommit ourselves to the protection and preservation of our shared land, air, water and wildlife. 

193 countries worldwide host #EarthDay events, a reminder that we are all called to be stewards of the planet and leave it a better place for our children. https://t.co/2k4H1XTWcSOur vets deserve access to every form of safe, effective relief there is — and I hear from vets more and more every day that they find relief in #cannabis.

The VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act authorizes @DeptVetAffairs to finally #dotheresearch on the use of #medicalcannabis! https://t.co/9smYWvs78VThank you to the tireless efforts by all law enforcement involved. I pray the healing can begin in the communities these tragic events have impacted, including in the First District. https://t.co/jL7O05LaFlWhen a veteran tells me they’re finding relief, I believe them. That's why I introduced the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act. With VA researching #MedicalCannabis, #veterans suffering from PTSD &amp; chronic pain would finally have the answers they deserve. https://t.co/Rv4gNi3tbRIf @realDonaldTrump wants to take care of our #veterans, then his focus should be on improving VA hospitals and recruiting world-class physicians, not privatizing the VA. https://t.co/WEGjg0yAcGIf we don’t fix the problem of partisanship plaguing Washington, who will?

Statement on the GOP #2018FarmBill: https://t.co/hGeQRcbYHU https://t.co/CnOfXy0MI4.@EPAScottPruitt’s reckless disregard for Americans’ health and tax dollars proves he is unfit to lead the @EPA. Today I cosponsored a resolution calling for his immediate resignation.

I urge all my GOP colleagues to join this call and stand up to corruption in the Trump Admin.In just 1 day, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act has earned strong #bipartisan support, proving research into #MedicalCannabis is not about politics, but serving #veterans. Watch me speak in support of the bill at yesterday's @HouseVetAffairs hearing. https://t.co/CxGhnrgws8I came to Congress to help write Farm Bills, to get policy right, and to work with all of my colleagues. We cannot normalize what Republicans did today in #HouseAg.

Watch my full remarks from today’s markup of the harmfully partisan #2018FarmBill: https://t.co/rOSjQVIleZ https://t.co/LtRsJsfBFtIn MN alone, 16k vets receive #SNAP benefits. If we let one be denied the basic human necessity of a meal, we are failing as a nation.
 
I implore the #HouseAg GOP &amp; @SpeakerRyan to strengthen &amp; #ProtectSNAP, not create barriers to access for vets who rely on it. #2018FarmBill#SNAP is the most effective anti-hunger program in US history, and that includes helping keep many of our warriors from going hungry when they return home.
 
It’s indefensible that the GOP would risk forcing a veteran to go hungry. #2018FarmBillTo keep our ag economy strong, the #2018FarmBill must help transfer skills, knowledge &amp; land between current &amp; future generations of farmers. My #BeginningFarmer and Rancher Opportunity Act will do just that. Learn more: https://t.co/HVYv5SAnVCNearly 100 million acres of farmland (enough to support ~250k family farms) is set to change hands over the next five years. The #HouseAg GOP is making a big mistake by failing to work with Dems to adequately invest in the next generation of farmers &amp; ranchers. #2018FarmBillA few yrs ago Rushford was hit by a devastating flood. Facing high costs, a local grocery store applied for a REAP grant which helped them install state of the art, energy efficient freezers &amp; coolers - lowering their monthly energy bill by $330. This is why REAP is so critical.The Rural Energy for America Program is a big deal for our small towns. Cutting these energy efficiency &amp; renewable energy grants/loans would hurt farmers and rural small businesses. That’s why I adamantly oppose the elimination of REAP funding in the #HouseAg GOP #2018FarmBill.Instead of cutting working lands programs by ~$5B as the GOP #2018FarmBill prescribes, we should support farmers by enhancing programs like CSP &amp; EQIP. That’s why I wrote the #SOILStewardshipAct.
 
Learn how my bill improves soil health &amp; water quality: https://t.co/DeAaIOxvqm~5k producers in MN enrolled over 3 million acres in the Conservation Stewardship Program. For a #MN01 family cattle farm, that means improved grazing. For anglers, that means a cleaner &amp; more sustainable habitat for the nearby trout stream.
 
The GOP #2018FarmBill would end CSP.As my constituents, you deserve a voice in the #2018FarmBill process. I’ll keep working to make #MN01 heard. Keep the faith. https://t.co/M9KLDJuDTTInstead of working together with Democrats in good faith, #HouseAg Republicans are taking up their partisan #FarmBill, which abandons farmers, consumers, veterans and children.

Today I’ll be making the case for why our producers and the millions who rely on them deserve better.First Lady Barbara Bush loved her family and her country. My heart is with the Bush Family during this time of mourning and I hope their many memories bring them comfort.Enjoyed the privilege of addressing the Minnesota State Building and Construction Trades Council at their Legislative Breakfast this morning. Thanks for all you do to build MN with quality and pride! https://t.co/AX7BkfTAXiGreat to talk the issues w/ @UMNews students including the #AbbyHonoldAct, a bill I helped introduce to help train law enforcement, first responders, university officials &amp; others who interface w/ victims of sexual violence how to use best practices &amp; trauma-informed techniques. https://t.co/pgiDyO4xo5Unlike @SpeakerRyan, Minnesotans know the difference between the top 1% and the middle-class.

My constituents sent me to Congress to fight for working-class families, not hand out tax cuts to billionaires and corporate giants. That’s why I voted against the #GOPTaxScam. #TaxDay https://t.co/6k5AEzjwzAThe VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2018 is a pragmatic &amp; #bipartisan piece of legislation that will help improve &amp; save the lives of #veterans across the country. Read my full statement w/ @DrPhilRoe, @RepLouCorrea, &amp; @SenatorTester here: https://t.co/wrR2XVWcPdI proudly stand with the 92% of veterans who support research into #MedicinalCannabis &amp; call on @DeptVetAffairs to make advancing this research a top priority. https://t.co/LehOWZTF2zSimply put, there is no department or organization better suited to conduct this critically important research than @DeptVetAffairs, and there will never be a better time to #DoTheResearch.22% of vets report using cannabis as a safer &amp; more effective alternative to opioids &amp; drug cocktails currently prescribed by VA for PTSD or chronic pain; yet, there has been a severe lack of research studying the full effect of #MedicinalCannabis on vets. https://t.co/4bkmZ97ix9I'm proud to introduce the #bipartisan VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2018 alongside @DrPhilRoe &amp; @RepLouCorrea. The bill authorizes VA to advance research into the safety of #MedicinalCannabis use on #veterans suffering from #PTSD &amp; #ChronicPain https://t.co/dzApOCGBmwWhat a surprise... https://t.co/u4RbkRRcMqWhen #TaxDay comes around, our service members &amp; their loved ones deserve peace of mind. 

Proud to intro the #MilitaryTaxpayerAssistanceAct w/ @RepRonKind to help our warriors &amp; their families as they work to meet their uniquely complex tax obligations.

https://t.co/RMTy7bdFyBBig thanks to plow drivers and police for their work to have the roads ready this morning!VA officials repeatedly misled Congress about improvements to the Washington, D.C. VA hospital, and in doing so, put the lives of #veterans in danger. This is unacceptable &amp; these officials should be called before @HouseVetAffairs to testify under oath. https://t.co/swdqthRz8oThanks to @FutureiQ, @UMNExt and our local leaders panel incl. @smifound, @ISD2752 and @GreenSeamRegion. Your contributions played a big role in sparking productive discussions on local opportunities and the role of the federal gov’t. Huge thanks to the Mayor of Waseca, Roy Srp! https://t.co/JA29pVrLJkUnbelievable turnout for today’s Regional Vitality Summit in Waseca. Can’t tell you how much I appreciate you taking time out of your day to discuss how to prepare southern MN for future success by building on our strengths and seizing opportunities. #MN01 has immense potential! https://t.co/nxSUvWUdJDToday we remember all those lost in the Holocaust and recommit to fighting hate, intolerance and evil around the globe. #HolocaustRemembranceDayUplifting conversations on the great potential of southern Minnesota and the amazing folks and places that make #MN01 what it is today. Thanks to Future iQ’s David Beurle, our Regional Strengths Panel, Bruce Schwartau of U of M Ext. and all the community leaders who joined us! https://t.co/dmpJlFCCGRThis injustice has gone on far too long. We need to join together as a nation to ensure women are paid the same as men for doing the same work. Equality can’t wait. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/hkU4WvUI71In Winona today for our 2nd Regional Vitality Summit! Critical discussions on how to capitalize on our southern MN strengths in order to thrive in the future. Big thanks to Mayor Mark Peterson and @MSCSoutheast President Larry Lundblad for welcoming us to beautiful bluff country! https://t.co/SuH7OReJRBPutin and the Kremlin’s interference in our democratic process is an attack on our country. The patriotic men and women of the FBI protect it, Mr. President. https://t.co/wag2yc11o0Neil Linscheid of U of M Extension facilitated the Middle of Everywhere exercise, which helped folks think regionally by having them identify where they live, work and recreate.

Big takeaway: folks want to live in #MN01 b/c of who we are today and where we are going tomorrow! https://t.co/2Xo9Eiwl2mVery grateful to the local leaders who shared their perspectives on the future of southern Minnesota at our Regional Vitality Summit in Luverne today. #MN01 is lucky to have passionate folks who think positively and regionally. #SoMinnSummit #SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/W8QKEg7BkOCongratulations to you and your family on the new baby girl, @SenDuckworth! https://t.co/nOwhqUSCzVDavid Beurle of Future IQ joined us at the #SoMinnSummit to provide a global perspective on current and anticipated trends in food, water and energy.

His assessment that southern Minnesota holds enormous potential is spot on! https://t.co/SXU3H0zr0YMinnesotans are optimistic people with vision. Yes, there are critical issues we must address together, but our spirit of innovation and collaboration is why #MN01 has a bright future ahead of it. We are well positioned to succeed if we lean in. https://t.co/ZPeiTaNZNvGreat to be in Rock County today for the first of three Regional Vitality Summits. Grateful to all the community leaders who joined together to discuss the future of southern MN. Thanks to Mayor Pat Baustian and the Luverne community for having us! #SoMinnSummit #SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/DesylZ3sAEPresident Trump's lack of concern for farm country is deeply troubling. https://t.co/8NQRPBx18MHad the honor of serving with Senator Akaka over the years at joint VA committee hearings, he was a true public servant for our nation's heroes and for the people of Hawaii.For months we read how senior @WhiteHouse &amp; VA staff circumvented @SecShulkin to enact a pro-privatization agenda. Now Shulkin is gone &amp; Koch operatives are pulling the strings. Make no mistake, this statement is nothing more than their weak &amp; transparent attempt to misguide vets https://t.co/rkdQN0isxV6 yrs after becoming law, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act I wrote with @louiseslaughter carries on her legacy.

Given this Admin’s widespread disregard for ethics, this law is more important today than ever.

No one is above the #STOCKact - not even the president.50 years ago, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated while in Memphis supporting black sanitation workers on strike due to unequal pay.

Our pursuit of justice has no finish line. Following in MLK’s footsteps, we must keep pushing forward for equality and civil rights. #MLK50 https://t.co/xZvf3CJfLl.@realDonaldTrump should do what is right for #veterans &amp; allow Deputy Secretary Thomas Bowman to serve as acting Secretary. To allow the distracting leadership struggle to go on at VA would be an immense disservice to veterans across the U.S. https://t.co/8PPzJHAH44#WorldAutismAwarenessDay is a great day to learn about autism, how it impacts folks’ lives &amp; how we can help end the stigma. While we need to raise awareness, we must also raise acceptance&amp;understanding. Thankful for parents&amp;advocates who’ve moved the ball forward in so many ways https://t.co/p6pMPuNQSrThe way @realDonaldTrump treats Dreamers is no way for anyone to treat contributing patriotic members of our country.

The way @realDonaldTrump approaches trade is no way for anyone to approach matters that have real-life impacts on working-class folks.

Enough, Mr. President.Trump did not consult a single veteran service organization before Secretary Shulkin’s sudden replacement. This is disappointing and unacceptable. Excluding veterans from conversations about their own healthcare is never the answer. https://t.co/3Vg0arTc9FToday, we pause to honor the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform. We can express our thanks by continuing our work to ensure all veterans have access to the care and benefits they have earned #VietnamWarVeteransDay #VietnamVeterans https://t.co/a3KDhRtVJeComing together in the face of tragedy represents the best of our Minnesota values. As we remember the tornado that devestated St. Peter 20 yrs ago, let us also remember the strength and resilience of our communities. https://t.co/DpZSgPtYxnThe stakes are high and Admiral Jackson must put veterans first, listen to VSOs and fight any and all attempts to fully privatize the VA. https://t.co/10bNtja5kDWe need to get back to the work of serving veterans. I don’t know a lot about Admiral Jackson, but I know he has a lot of work to do following the chaos and dysfunction President Trump has created at the VA.While Donald was tending to his bone spurs, Mueller was fighting in Vietnam. When it comes to protecting our democracy, the American people know who to trust. https://t.co/0qPYiXPB55On behalf of our Liberian communities in MN, we cannot accept this. I’ll continue working w/ members of both parties to make sure Liberians living in the US legally under DED protection aren’t forced to choose between breaking the law and leaving the country against their wishes. https://t.co/XqfHxLFdt2I thought President Trump’s military parade idea was the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. I was wrong. Taking money we could use to give our warriors better pay in order to build his ridiculous wall is way stupider. https://t.co/XbWqoJrFAZBecause of the courage Linda Brown and so many other students demonstrated, our nation changed for the better. May her legacy continue to remind today’s student leaders that it’s never too early to participate in our democracy.

Rest in power, Ms. Brown. https://t.co/vblMCG5RugGood move. The US must stand with our allies against Russia’s recklessness and aggression around the globe. https://t.co/S544MPTbZyPresident Trump has disrespected the service and sacrifice of our brave transgender troops all for the purpose of distracting from his own scandals.

In addition to ending this disgraceful ban, @realDonaldTrump owes our entire military an apology.What we don’t need as a nation is to start banning patriotic citizens from volunteering to serve in the military - something @realDonaldTrump never did. What we do need is a new commander-in-chief.At a time when we should be investing in a broad, diverse health care workforce, the #TrumpBudget would eliminate 14 health professions training programs. 

Ending training opportunities won’t help expand access to care in rural and underserved communities, @realDonaldTrump.From #MedicaidExpansion to protecting folks w/ pre-existing conditions, the #ACA was a big step forward in our fight for universal heath care. Still, we have a long way to go.

Together, we must ensure everyone has access to high-quality, affordable health care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/8yxYEw3GutI want to thank the MN students who met w/ my DC staff this morning. I’m proud to stand w/ you to push for commonsense gun safety measures like universal background checks, a military-style assault weapons ban &amp; CDC research into gun violence.

Your leadership inspires us all.As a teacher and parent, I know how critical the participation of our youth is to bringing about change in our democracy. 

I’m proud of these students for their advocacy, and it’s inaccurate to say I wouldn’t meet with them. I would’ve loved to but I’m in Minnesota today. https://t.co/EJWUSLakxOIn MN, #Medicaid covers:

• 1 in 4 children
• 1 in 2 nursing home residents
• 1 in 2 people with disabilities

The #TrumpBudget would cut $250 billion from Medicaid over the next ten years. This is just plain wrong, @realDonaldTrump.

We need a moral leader in the White House. https://t.co/tvvmpopxvk.@realDonaldTrump’s dangerous decision to appoint John Bolton as National Security Adviser is a prime example of why Rep. Walter Jones and I are working to force a vote on a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force.

Congress must be a check on this presidency.John Bolton’s extreme, pro-war track record makes his appointment to be the next NSA a big step in the wrong direction.

Time for Congress to debate AUMF.Thank you to LTG H.R. McMaster for speaking truth to power and serving honorably in the name of our national security.

Appreciate you being there yesterday. Your work is so important. https://t.co/IPRaI99vT5Least surprising thing so far today is @realDonaldTrump admitted to making up claims on trade when speaking with Canadian prime minister.#NationalWalkoutDay is a call to action. Many Dems are hearing the call, but not enough Republicans in Congress are getting the message.

We were sent to Washington to get things done. Now let’s advance commonsense gun safety measures we can agree on.

Answer the call, @HouseGOP.Keeping students safe in our schools must be a top priority. I supported the STOP School Violence Act today b/c it is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.

As we’ve heard from students all across the nation, Congress must work together on commonsense gun safety.Thank you to the student leaders who have chosen to stand up and #walkout together for commonsense gun safety laws. Your voices are being heard.

Congress must act to protect our schools from gun violence while upholding the 2A rights of law-abiding citizens.

#NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/s3oUA6FYQtRick Perry is unfit to be VA Secretary.

#ProtectDreamers #DreamActNow https://t.co/QYsWcuTY17"After I graduated from the community college... I didn't continue my education until June 15, 2012 when #DACA was [established by President Obama.] That truly changed my world." - Natalia

#ProtectDreamers #DreamActNow https://t.co/wNeJeUK5RhMeet Natalia, a MN #Dreamer. In 7th grade, she was brought by her parents from Peru to the US. Thanks to #DACA, she was able to get a driver's license, a work permit &amp; is now pursuing a degree in social work. This is her story. This is why Congress must pass the #DreamActNow. https://t.co/w1TxXfHQN5Excited to welcome #MN01 high schoolers to participate in the 2018 #CongressionalArtCompetition! My office is accepting submissions through March 23. Can’t wait to see your works of art!

Thank you for helping Minnesota better understand the issues, our politics and each other. Mayo Clinic will be well served by your integrity and talent. https://t.co/MouDOP2uPN83% of the #GOPTaxScam benefits go to those making over $900k. View the video below to learn about how President Trump and the Congressional GOP put corporations over the middle class.

Thanks for telling it how it is, @WhipHoyer. Proud to fight alongside you for working people. https://t.co/XlUSafECJXProud to celebrate the contributions women have made &amp; continue to make to the US including #womenvets and those currently serving in uniform.

Thank you for your service &amp; sacrifice. Your courage inspires us all to keep up the fight for equality here at home. #WomensHistoryMonthI applaud the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force &amp; POTUS for meeting, &amp; echo the Task Force’s call for action. 
 
@SpeakerRyan, bring commonsense gun safety legislation like background checks, CDC research &amp; an assault weapons ban to the floor. Let Congress do the people’s work.Why did he ever have access in the first place? Another dangerous example of the President and this White House’s reckless disregard for our national security. https://t.co/FNqkOo7Y0YThe #TrumpBudget includes a mere $100K for the Lewis &amp; Clark Regional Water System, a drastic cut from last yr. To live up to the fed govt’s commitment to our rural SW MN communities, POTUS should be upping fed funds, not gutting them. Rural water must be a top priority. #LCRWS#NetNeutrality is critically important to the competitiveness of our small businesses and the vitality of our rural communities. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/8l6pFWDiIGTo #SaveTheInternet, we must #SaveNetNeutrality. Proud to join 149 of my colleagues to introduce legislation to reinstate #NetNeutrality and make sure the internet remains free and open to all! https://t.co/3gZU3pHpu2Signed a discharge petition in favor of requiring background checks for all commercial gun sales - a commonsense, bipartisan gun safety measure that would close the gun show loophole once and for all.
 
@SpeakerRyan, bring it to the Floor and let the Congress debate.Being able to organize and collectively bargain is about the freedom to live our lives the way we want. #JanusvAFSCME https://t.co/L16OqePDeMThis week I am joining 139 of my colleagues to introduce a commonsense ban on military-style assault weapons. Enough is enough. https://t.co/lfj3enPNemMillions of Americans, including seniors, kids, folks w/ disabilities, vets &amp; working families, rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 

The #TrumpBudget would cut #SNAP by more than $200 billion over 10 years. This is unconscionable. https://t.co/Qfxpj2rcc1Sent my staff to tour Harmony Enterprises &amp; the Harmony Kids Learning Center. Such an innovative model to attract &amp; retain quality workers in rural MN while providing top-notch early childhood education. My team was impressed by their ingenuity &amp; can-do spirit! #SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/1rVlKB5pajOver coffee with Houston County officials in Caledonia, my team heard about how important it is for Congress to stop the short-term funding fiascos and pass long-term transportation bills. Our small rural counties can’t afford uncertainty and political games. #SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/oqIcAPviozOn the way to a meeting in Caledonia, my team stopped in Spring Grove to talk with shop owners and heard about the unique traits of the first Norwegian settlement in MN at the Heritage Center. #SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/f6YNnvNvLMSent my staff to the beautiful Lanesboro to hear from community leaders about their exciting plans for the future. #SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/w4bbRnbwQtArming our teachers is not a commonsense gun safety measure. How about we give them the pay and respect they deserve instead?Unlike @realDonaldTrump’s empty promises, #Medicaid means a great deal to the 1 in 2 Minnesotans with disabilities it covers.

That is why we must fight harder than ever to stop the proposed $250 billion cut to Medicaid in the #TrumpBudget.

Together, we will succeed. https://t.co/eyuY6daZy1From my years spent teaching high school geography &amp; supervising the cafeteria, I know that when #StudentsDemandAction, their voices can be powerful. 

They know that to prevent gun violence, we have to act.

Our students are our future. We would be wise to listen to them.Congratulations to Minnesota’s own @jessdiggs on winning #gold in women’s cross-country skiing team sprint! #TeamUSA #Olympics https://t.co/BK3dPXQNLJPresident Trump’s own handpicked national security adviser says there is no doubt Putin and the Kremlin attacked our electoral process. When will we hear the same from our commander in chief? https://t.co/PP9N6k5RvGThis behavior is disturbing, represents the worst in Washington politics, and must be brought to a swift and decisive end. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/1LEihLRLNt https://t.co/2yVUFuHPA6.@realDonaldTrump must immediately distance his administration from forces that are actively working to privatize VA for their financial gain. https://t.co/BVSKQ05KT2The Koch brothers &amp; corporate interests are at the helm of an effort to privatize VA in order to make money at the expense of #veterans. https://t.co/2e95ghYr2nThe indictment of 13 Russian nationals reaffirms that Putin’s attack on our democracy is not fake news. It’s as real as it gets. 

@realDonaldTrump better start to take it seriously. Implement the bipartisan sanctions on the Kremlin. Protect our elections. Defend our democracy. https://t.co/7AXRR3gBK2Proud to continue fighting alongside @CongPalazzo, @NGAUS1878 and other vital partners to ensure fairness in benefits for our #NationalGuard and #Reserve Component troops. https://t.co/1W853ArFQyThe budget is more than a fiscal document. It’s a statement of our national values.

By eliminating vital programs our students, schools, rural communities, and local economies rely on, the #TrumpBudget paints a cruel picture of @realDonaldTrump’s values. https://t.co/8zv4OBRz97To ensure the next #FarmBill is truly a #NextGenFarmBill, we must champion conservation priorities including #SoilHealth. Thanks to all who participated in our #ForTheLoveOfSoil briefing yesterday! https://t.co/8I4dLUxgfyThe Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is an important bipartisan effort to fight invasive species and restore our ecosystem. Yet, the @EPA hardly has enough folks on the payroll in Chicago to manage everything, including #GLRI. Staff the EPA, @EPAScottPruitt! https://t.co/Tpkfj2bos5Important meeting yesterday on the need for additional staffing at @SocialSecurity. Prioritize our seniors, folks with disabilities, and survivors, @realDonaldTrump! Every American deserves a life of dignity. https://t.co/z3cKeWyCgrJust a few of the names of Tibetan political prisoners detained by Chinese authorities. As a Commissioner on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, I call on the Chinese gov’t to address these ongoing human rights abuses and resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama. https://t.co/OrjLQxplaPHumbled to receive this honor. Thank you to @DAVHQ for all you do to empower our vets to lead high-quality lives with dignity and respect. Your partnership is invaluable and I look forward to continue to fight for our vets together. https://t.co/HANg9NvPFxImportant hearing with VA Secretary on IG report and President’s budget request this morning https://t.co/Vh6n3883JGSaddened beyond words about the tragedy in Florida. No community should ever endure such unthinkable pain.

Thoughts and prayers are not enough. We must work together as one nation to advance solutions that could help save lives.My joint statement with @SenatorIsakson, @SenatorTester and @DrPhilRoe on IG report regarding VA Secretary travel: https://t.co/laoXg0wfMVDomestic abuse is never acceptable and neither is the White House lying to the public. The House Oversight Committee investigation into this matter is a step in the right direction. https://t.co/heuhyVlHJ6Thank you @RepRichmond and @RepGarretGraves for the #KingCakes! Why just the one pic below? By the time the photo opp came around, yours was long gone @RepRichmond! 😅 #SorryNotSorry #MardiGras https://t.co/Xeu8NRPafbWe Americans expect our president to do everything in their power to defend our elections. I have little confidence @realDonaldTrump will do so as he has so far failed to even acknowledge Putin's attacks. This should alarm us all - Republicans and Dems. https://t.co/gkhWV5ljQ6In #BlueEarth, my staff also met with United Hospital District to learn about the benefits of community-based rural health care systems and to identify the challenges facing our small town health care providers.

#SoMinnWayOfLife #FaribaultCounty https://t.co/IawIrtGRZVAt BEVCOMM, we heard about the need to fully fund the universal service fund and to look at Minnesota’s successful broadband grant program as a model for the nation.

#SoMinnWayOfLife #FaribaultCounty https://t.co/zjOC1oN0JsUp next: #BlueEarth

My staff toured BEVCOMM to learn about the importance of rural broadband as critical infrastructure that's tied to the vitality and future of our #MN01 communities.

#SoMinnWayOfLife #FaribaultCounty https://t.co/S4BH1u6YukMy chief of staff met with WSU President Scott Olson to listen to the role the university plays in the region’s vitality and future. https://t.co/OdfCZg8vQvMy Chief of Staff also met with #LaCrescent Mayor Mike Poellinger to talk about economic development, education, and regional amenities like the proposed bike path over the Mississippi River. #SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/UCM4RelcreMy team had a great meeting with #Winona Mayor Mark Peterson and City Manager Stephen Sarvi. Topics of discussion included plans for entrepreneurship, arts and culture, and outdoor recreation. #SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/YPvPPvvE6YOur #SoMinnWayOfLife Tour continues! 

My team appreciated talking technical education and workforce development with Dr. Larry Lundblad, Interim President of MN State College Southeast in #Winona. https://t.co/CE74tzKJg7As a nation, it is our sacred obligation to care for those who have borne the battle.

VA research into the effects of medical cannabis on vets living w/ PTSD &amp; chronic pain is a vital part of fulfilling this duty.

Our vets deserve nothing less.

#DoTheResearch #Vets4MMJResearchAs a nation, we have a moral responsibility to protect ALL #Dreamers, including those serving in uniform. #ProtectDreamers #DreamActNow https://t.co/U0snVFSwaACountless #veterans living with #PTSD &amp; chronic pain have told us how #MedicalCannabis has not just improved their quality of life, but in many cases, saved their lives. It is long past time for @realDonaldTrump to direct @DeptVetAffairs to #DoTheResearch. https://t.co/T4uD7xfvXTRick Nolan is a champion for working people. His focus on jobs, health care, edu, the middle class &amp; campaign finance reform is inspiring.

I've also enjoyed working w/ Rick on vets' issues. He sure fights for #MN08 &amp; I love that about him. Thanks for your years of service, Rick. https://t.co/TzYlztJiHZLet’s be 100% clear. Every year, millions upon millions of #veterans choose to get their health care through @VeteransHealth. Privatizing @VeteransHealth would be a disgusting betrayal of the veterans @realDonaldTrump promised to protect &amp; care for on the campaign trail.@realDonaldTrump @SecShulkin @DeptVetAffairs This confirms what we've known all along: that @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @WhiteHouse are playing into the hands of the partisan Koch Brothers' organization Concerned Veterans for America to privatize @DeptVetAffairs &amp; @VeteransHealth. Now President Trump plans to purge the ranks..@realDonaldTrump is threatening to remove Deputy Secretary Bowman b/c he &amp; @SecShulkin have not gone along w/ President Trump &amp; the Koch Brothers' misguided efforts to privatize @DeptVetAffairs. This is extremely disturbing &amp; unacceptable. https://t.co/6LctNl71d6By leaving #Dreamers behind and putting us on a path to a trillion dollar deficit when combined with the reckless Republican tax bill, this #budgetdeal does not meet my moral standard. 

My statement on voting no: https://t.co/qiy8nG3VbkThank you to all who participated in our #FillmoreCounty Roundtable in #Preston. Your ideas and input are integral to my work in Washington. I'll keep fighting on your behalf to protect and enhance our way of life in #MN01.

#SoMinnWayOfLife https://t.co/dRtgVx6JcyFolks in #FillmoreCounty also raised serious challenges facing our rural areas, including:

- health care costs
- attracting and keeping young folks
- student loan costs
- mental health care

We've been hearing these same concerns all across #MN01.
