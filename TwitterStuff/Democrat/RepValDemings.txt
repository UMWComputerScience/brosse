When asked where the girls and toddlers are being held, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen didn’t know. She should know. The number of girls under the age of 18 apprehended at the border this fiscal year was 13,008 compared to last year’s 7,339. Where are they?
#FamilesBelongTogetherMany of the migrant girls came to the U.S. to flee the violence back home. Tearing them away from their families exacerbates their trauma. 

Furthermore, None of the images of detained migrant children pictured girls. Is there something to hide? 

#FamiliesBelongTogetherWhere are the children? Is there a log for where they are and who are their parents? What are the conditions and required training/background checks for those with access to the children? Americans deserve an answer. #FamiliesBelongTogetherChildren do not belong in cages, nor detention centers. Parents don’t deserve to not be aware of where their children are. That is why this weekend’s #FamiliesBelongTogether march matters. 

We must begin reuniting families. Stop #FamilySeparation.The families at our border need help, we have must continue to take a stand for the hundreds of children who were cruelly ripped away from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether.#CentralFL, I hear you. I've received several calls asking how many of you can help the separated families beyond giving. Here is a sampling of volunteer opportunities for those who wish to help w/ families separation at the Border. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/7ZS7BLkHKoIt’s appalling that this administration tore thousands of children from their parents without a single thought of how to reunite them. So much damage has already been done. But we can prevent more. Family reunification must begin immediately. #FamilesBelongTogetherMarchThe American people are marching for the soul of our country, and Congress must listen. It’s just a first step to say “this is wrong.” We need immediate action to reunite families and stop incarcerating children. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarchWhile I am disappointed, this is only one instance of a massive campaign throughout this administration to make discrimination the law of the land. It falls once again to Congress to hold this Administration accountable. #NoMuslimBan https://t.co/B18riC4g3HOur communities are strengthened by the diversity of our brothers, sisters, and neighbors. We work together, invent and learn together, grow our economy and enrich our society together, raise our children together. No one should be banned because of their religion. #NoMuslimBanNext week, please join me at my district office for an open conversation. I look forward to hearing from constituents.

Please be sure to RSVP. https://t.co/5XsVjCfEaTDuring my visit to detention centers in Texas, I raised questions about federal prison staffing problems, and voiced my concern regarding housing immigration detainees. https://t.co/9hBIC7Bvl1Thank you to @orlandosentinel for covering the importance of the 18 new safety officers at @MCO.

https://t.co/y7oEWcgpN1As we continue to learn more about today’s mass shooting, one thing is crystal clear: this has to stop.

When will we begin to take #gunviolence and #gunsafety seriously? https://t.co/rabHNr2azRChildren are not appointed attorneys to assist them in navigating our complex immigration laws and immigration system. Due process demands that all children have someone by their side to assist them in proceedings that may determine their fates and futures. https://t.co/IeyWCFTdubMore than half of children do not have an attorney to represent them in immigration court—a due process crisis that risks the return of children to harm or even death. No child should have to face these high stakes alone. #FamiliesBelongTogether #FamilySeparations https://t.co/pCeunGUSNqDeputy AG Rosenstein &amp; FBI Director Wray have important jobs—as does Congress. It is a mistake to misuse their time &amp; our own in political theater. Reminder: the Special Counsel investigation has already yielded enough evidence to result in five guilty pleas. Let it work!Families need action on real issues, including securing our elections, protecting your legal right to affordable healthcare, and stopping the cruel and unnecessary child incarceration on the border. Instead, we're hearing about Hillary Clinton's emails. https://t.co/TzsSUs9rpcToday, a new poll reveals an overwhelming majority of American voters believe health care is a top issue &amp;protecting provisions preventing discrimination against the 130M Americans w/ pre-existing conditions is one of their highest priorities. https://t.co/m0I2BqoI5fOfficials have yet to issue a plan to reunite children with parents.

Mothers and fathers unable to recover their children is just one cruel consequence of Trump’s heinous family separation policy.  https://t.co/uDyxoutl63Despite Trump’s executive order, families may not be put back together. This travesty is the consequence of haphazardly implementing a purely political, inhumane, anti-immigrant policy. https://t.co/Z84f3awYZW #KeepFamiliesTogetherPresident Trump's cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reuniting them. Even worse, they deported some moms and dads before they were able to recover their children. This can't stand!

https://t.co/nklCMsXUqqFrom earlier today: on a detention center bus gong to talk with moms who have been separated from their children. https://t.co/WzPasgtpOOBorder Patrol officers have been given an unjust order by this admin. Instead of incarcerating children, our officers should be able to use their limited resources protecting us from violent ppl. Today, I saw the moms, dads &amp;children who are victims of Pres Trump's border policy. https://t.co/NHZHgNuzBdSeeing is believing.

I care because #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/2yGQ8HnpFACongratulations graduates! https://t.co/2rUvUXWgHxRepublican efforts to sabotage the #ACA continue to leave more people in #Florida uninsured and our premiums soaring.

How are DHS are HHS keeping records of parents and children? How quickly can children be located? Is there an electronic database? paper file?#KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/OZAc4HgspNAs public officials, it is our job to care. #ShirleyChisholm once said, “America has the laws and the material resources it takes to insure justice for all its people. What it lacks is the heart, the humanity.” Let’s live w/ our heart.

“We Should All Care” Art: @justinteodoro https://t.co/rRhieZ3axeThe #GOPTaxScam for the rich is doing even more damage than we expected. According to @USCBO, it’s creating even more debt than expected – further endangering Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. https://t.co/0GejsN7PbmThe GOP’s extreme budget resolution proves their priorities lie with millionaires and big corporations. What’s worse is that they’re forcing American families to pay the price. #GOPTaxScamThe practice of separating children from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane and cruel. Seeking asylum is not illegal, in fact, it is written into US immigration laws to ensure that those w/a credible fear of persecution can present their case. https://t.co/GNSwC8dsp2Family unity is recognized as a fundamental human right, enshrined in international law. The Trump Administration’s proposal and subsequent actions to separate immigrant families flies in the face of this norm. It must stop. https://t.co/BTQiCmwkQQI'm glad to report that this extreme anti-family bill failed. https://t.co/4W8ZTfvIdeToday, I asked my colleagues to reject the Goodlatte bill because families seeking asylum are not a threat. Toddlers and children on the border are not a threat. Dreamers who were brought here as young children through no fault of their own are not a threat. https://t.co/IfkhFBoaoSBoys are being sent to a West Texas “tent city” to help with the overflow of kids torn from their parents. Where are the girls going? #WhereAreTheGirls?Hi Twitter! #HappySelfieDay! https://t.co/YDLiCovJfH.@EmiliaSykesOH should be treated equally, there should not be increased attention or security because she doesn't "look like a lawmaker." She is one of 276 AfrAm omn who serve in the state legislature. She was elected as a public official and should be treated as such.Only 39 African-American women have served in the history of Congress.

It’s our job to protect the programs that serve our constituents, and reclaim a secure future for every working family.Today, @HouseDemocrats held a press conference to mark six months since the House passed the deficit-exploding #GOPTaxScam for the rich, as House Republicans begin to mark-up a budget calling for massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid to fill the hole for their tax giveaways. https://t.co/t6biAcaYMWIf working people can’t retire in security, if a health crisis bankrupts your family, if you have to work until the day you die, then we have abandoned the American Dream.When healthcare is more expensive, when #Medicare and #Medicaid are cut, it will cause preventable deaths and bankrupt families.The average FL family – working ppl are paying an increase in their healthcare costs nearly four times larger than their meager tax cut. Now, after gutting our healthcare system to line their pockets, the GOP is doubling down, proposing shocking cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.But the GOP tax plan is making it harder to support your family, raising your healthcare costs, putting your right to manage your own health further out of reach, and threatening millions of families with insurmountable debt and bankruptcy.We went to work every day, just like hard-working men and women across our country. We clocked in and worked hard to provide for our families. https://t.co/deUv6nUCXzMy mother was a maid and my father was a janitor. They worked hard, and taught us the value of hard work. I’ve worked as a law enforcement officer and as a social worker, and in both professions my colleagues didn’t expect to get rich, but they did expect to get by.It weakens our nation and poisons our souls to rip children from their families.

Two years after the attack, I believe more strongly than ever that love will win. The pain will never go away. But we can turn that pain into action. #LoveWins #Pulse97% of Americans support that idea, yet Congress has done nothing. We have not implemented universal waiting periods, which 83% of Americans support, because we know that if someone needs a gun at once, it probably means trouble. #PulseOrlando #PulseRemembranceDayOur job as legislators is to create laws which allow Americans to live their lives in safety and security. Two years after Pulse, we have not done that job. We have not closed the loopholes which allow disturbed people to buy a gun with no background check. #PulseOrlandoEvery American should have the right to go to school, or church, or a mall or a movie theater – or a nightclub – without being brutally murdered or wounded by someone with a gun. #PulseOrlandoTo watch: https://t.co/dwq7D78cyW https://t.co/fpnaxbF6q4We will not forget those who lost their lives. We will not forget our neighbors and friends still recovering from devastating injuries, whether mental or physical. We will grieve, we will remember, and we will strengthen the ties that bind our community into one family.Today, we can transform our sorrow into love and progress. We can protect and promote true safe spaces for the LGBTQ and Latinx population. We can work to prevent any more gun violence in our community. #PulseOrlandoOrlando lost 49 lives that night. We lost 49 lives that night. Many others had their lives forever changed. After the attack, we saw our community come together. We donated blood together, raised money together, mourned together. #PulseOrlandoThey were living their lives, taking refuge in song and dance and joy, celebrating their common humanity at a time when the common humanity of LGBTQ Americans was not, and it still not, universally recognized in our country. #PulseOrlando #OrlandoStrongThis is what I want to emphasize: The victims at Pulse, like every other mass shooting, were not in ‘the wrong place at the wrong time.’ They were exactly where they were supposed to be. #PulseOrlando #OrlandoStrongFor the men and women at Pulse two years ago, the nightclub was a refuge. It was a haven for our LGBTQ community, and particularly the Latinx LGBTQ community as they gathered to celebrate Latin Night. It was a place for what my Bishop likes to call late-night fellowship.The Pulse attacks was the second-worst mass shooting in modern American history, the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, and the worst attack against the LGBTQ population in our history. #PulseOrlandoI am speaking on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives right now to honor the victims of the #Pulse shooting. As the world’s most powerful legislative body, we have to take action. #OrlandoStrongToday, many churches gathered for the ringing of 49 bells at First United Methodist Church in honor of the Pulse victims. While we are still devastated, the Orlando community pulled together and stood united in the face of adversity. #OrlandoStrong https://t.co/bnkQNylKIIGuns in the wrong hands kill innocent people.

We will transform our sorrow into love and progress. We will grieve, we will remember, we will unite. We will stand with our LGBTQ &amp; Latino community. We will work to end #GunViolence &amp; #DisarmHate. Today, we are #OrlandoStrong. https://t.co/4xJVLqGLyHI am praying for the @OrlandoPolice officer shot late last night.

There is no better time than this anniversary to take action in the fight for fair pay. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/eeLjqZ842SToday, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 turns 55 years old, yet the pay gap remains a harsh reality for women and their families. Women working full time, on average, still only make 80 cents compared to men, and that gap is even wider for African American women and Latinas. https://t.co/CkXXefXz4KEvery day we lose too many American lives to gun violence.Gun safety is a public health issue. It's not up for debate.Florida approved hundreds of thousands of people to carry guns in public without bothering to check if those people were dangerous.

Nearly 45,000 Americans age 10 or older died by suicide in 2016, making it the 10th leading cause of death. We have to take a comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention.More police officers die by suicide than in the line of duty. In 2017 there were an estimated 140 law enforcement suicides. We cannot ask our officers to do this dangerous and stressful work without also helping them live through the consequences.Anthony Bourdain was a brilliant chef, author and television personality.
