Today in every corner of our country, Americans are standing up and demanding a just and humane immigration system, one that keeps families together. Proud to join you all in standing up for what is right! #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/JcqBaAxgc4Solving the immigration crisis means finding solutions to the larger systemic problems of migration from Central America to the US. I am proud to support this bill that shines a light on the conditions that push immigrants to flee their home countries. https://t.co/GHskoZRcMhAcross the country, and in newsrooms all over the world, we’re praying for the safety of journalists and staff at the #CapitalGazette in Annapolis, Maryland. My heart goes out to the families of these victims. Congress needs to take action to prevent the tragedies of gun violenceAs a member of @HASCDemocrats, it's an honor to serve as a conferee in the FY19 #NDAA conference committee. It’s a critical time for bipartisan solutions to ensure our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to protect our country at home and abroad.ATTN @HouseGOP: We are ready to work with you- bring us to the table. #DREAMers #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/faxIzMcRU2Since SCOTUS decided Shelby County v. Holder five years ago, more than two dozen states have enacted anti-voter laws that make it harder to register and cast your ballot. Every American must be guaranteed a voice in our democracy – we must #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/aMp4Pk4lB2Instead of wasting time bringing bad immigration bills to the floor, Republicans should be working with Dems to find real solutions for immigrant families.We need to put aside partisan blinders and work together. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/ZPHK0NfnSOThe #Janus decision undercuts the ability of unions to advocate for workers around this country that desperately need a voice. Today and everyday I stand with unions! We won't stop fighting to protect wages for working families! #UnionStrong #Union https://t.co/BathRNyL96This is a case brought by special interests in the name of ‘fairness’ to employees who benefit from collective bargaining, but don’t want to pay their fair share. #SCOTUS' decision divides this country and hinders unions from advocating on behalf of 17.3M workers who need a voice#Janus decision undermines the freedom of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and all public service workers from negotiating fair wages for a fair day’s work. https://t.co/WnnarB4e72Throughout our history, American entrepreneurship has continued to move us forward. #NetNeutrality protects that same spirit of innovation and ensures that the next generation of Americans have a level playing field. #SaveTheInternetI urge all my colleagues to support the Equality Act to extent existing civil rights protections to #LGBTQ people by prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. #EqualityForwardWhether it is in the halls of Congress or at airports, we can't let this ban stand without a fight. We can't stop until we can get this decision overturned. #NoMuslimBanEverAmerica is a country of innovation, and Artificial Intelligence and Big Data are impacting every facet of production and commerce.  As these digital technological advancements revolutionize the energy sector, we must ensure a safe and responsible execution.  #AI https://t.co/cGpDNJCmGDWith yesterday's redistricting decision and today's ruling to uphold Trump's Muslim Ban, CJ Roberts' court will now forever be compared to CJ Fuller's and Taney's. If you are not sure whom these two men are, know that dangerous days lie ahead. 
https://t.co/ApPyPrZBWnThere is nothing ‘typical’ about Trump’s government policy to target the Muslim community. It’s a dark stain on this country and we can’t let it stand without a fight. #NoMuslimBanEver #NoBanNoWall 
https://t.co/rXxNFSEs6xThe consequences of Trump's negligent and inhumane family separation policy are devastating. I can't begin to imagine the anguish these parents are going through. It's time for the Trump administration to work to reunite families. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/bfKJT1zrTOOrganizations like @letamericavote are helping our country #RestoreTheVote!It's crucial to a functioning democracy that our congressional maps are fair – and that Sec 2 of the VRA, which protects minorities’ right to vote is enforced. The district I represent exists because Texans fought in court to protect our fundamental voting rights. #RestoreTheVoteGerrymandering on the basis of one’s skin color is contrary to our fundamental democratic principles of fair and effective representation and reverses our country’s progress towards equal opportunity. We must take action and #RestoreTheVOTEToday’s Supreme Court ruling in Texas’ intentional racial redistricting case is a huge wakeup call. The Courts aren’t enforcing Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects minorities’ right to vote. #RestoreTheVote https://t.co/kxzyuGJyDMProud to support @CongressmanRaja in introducing an amendment to @DeptofDefense funding to stop military bases from becoming detention centers. #FamiliesBelongTogether 
https://t.co/rKFB5aV4WiProud to join over 120 of my colleagues in demanding answers from @DHSgov and @HHSGov on family reunification. It's time for the Trump administration to face the consequences of its inhumane policy and work out a plan to #KeepFamiliesTogether. 
https://t.co/JGpwY6lczHI’ve joined @RepLouCorrea because we need answers from @DHSgov &amp; @HHSgov to know what info they have to reunite separated children with their parents.  We're demanding accountability and action now. #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/SdiJnYmHstI will always be an advocate for a bipartisan solution on immigration. These two bills on the House floor are not that. We still have 2,000 children who haven’t been reunited with their families, and who face becoming orphans if their parents get deported. We need real solutions!Spoke to @JulieFineNBC5 about the two immigration bills on the floor. Let’s be clear these bills aren't a solution for the men, women &amp; children seeking asylum at our borders. It doesn’t solve the problems that Democrats have been trying to address across the aisle with @HouseGOP https://t.co/Rs7nAA1bOgTo all those who have called and written my office expressing your concern about the crisis on our border, I share your outrage. This fight is not over. Keep the calls coming! Trump’s Executive Order is a sham. We need to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct now!This Administration ripped them away from their parents and now refuses to make efforts to reunite these kids with their families. How can Trump show no compassion for these human beings? #KeepFamliesTogether https://t.co/NM2PermYOVTime to get the facts straight:

•The Executive Order doesn't fix the crisis happening on our border. 
•W/ the continuation of zero-tolerance, Trump plans to detain families &amp; children indefinitely. 

.@realDonaldTrump pretends to end one crisis while starting a new one.On #WorldRefugeeDay @realDonaldTrump has skirted the opportunity to resolve the crisis he created. His EO is not a real solution for families seeking asylum at the border.#FortWorth based @AmericanAir makes us proud! @realDonaldTrump: You have no shame /no tienes vergüenza. https://t.co/VgtQnHjdxJSpoke to @CTuckerNews for @NBCDFW  about the inhumane practice of separating families at the border. President Trump has the power to pick up the phone right now and stop this cruelty. He has the power to #KeepFamiliesTogether. https://t.co/4VHTQGrabJThere is NO law that requires children to be ripped away from their parents. Make no mistake, family separation at our borders is a Trump mandated policy.  #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/5zgBjeXT24We have heard the stories, seen the pictures, and heard the cries of the children separated from their parents. What is happening at our borders is abhorrent and this is why I’m joining over 190 members of Congress to support the #KeepFamilesTogether Act to end family separation.#Juneteenth marked a turning point in the fight to free our fellow Americans from the bonds of slavery. In Texas, we celebrate it as a day of freedom and seize the opportunity to educate the next generation of Americans about such a historic day. https://t.co/E8nH3LYfQZTrump will not win by demoralizing these communities. America’s diversity, and ability to be a sanctuary from violence, is what makes our country great. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/Lj9kpOLObsThe maps drawn by the Republicans in Texas trample upon our democratic principles, and I urge the Supreme Court to address the larger constitutional question of fairness.While I’m disappointed that the court didn't rule on the substantive claims made against partisan gerrymandering, I'm pleased that the claims remain alive.
https://t.co/1lINks4aFSAllowing controversial partisan district maps in this fall’s midterm elections dilutes voters’ fair and effective representation.Ripping children away from their parents is inhumane. The decision to criminally prosecute all asylum seekers shows no mercy. There should be NO place for this kind of cruelty in our immigration policy. #KeepFamiliesTogetherNow isn't the time to turn our backs on these families, women and children, who have risked their lives to seek our protection. #KeepFamiliesTogether
https://t.co/N1gfCYZTY8We have seen the photos and heard the heart-wrenching stories. What is happening on our borders is devastating and not who we are as Americans. #KeepFamiliesTogetherLet’s be clear, the zero-tolerance policy that has led to the increase of children being separated from their parents is a Trump Administration implemented policy. Trump has the power to reverse this policy today. #KeepFamiliesTogetherFrom Illinois to Texas, the American people do not want this to be our new normal. We are better than this. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/te5TjtNQkaThis is more important today than ever before. Happy #FathersDay to all the fathers, uncles, and grandfathers celebrating with their families today.It was great to have my son Adam cheer me on at this year’s #congressionalbaseballgame. Like all the fathers in my district, I work hard to make my son proud. Together, as a community, we must all do our part to ensure we leave our children a better world. https://t.co/6H3aXJnUHRNow more than ever, we must fight for our DREAMers. I am committed to working on bipartisan immigration reform that protects our DREAMers and keeps families together.Six years ago today, over 200,000 Texans were given much needed deportation relief and an opportunity at the American Dream through #DACA. Since the start of the program, these young #DREAMers have been able to peacefully work, study, and contribute to our economy.My son Adam watching me bat! #TX33 #Texasforever https://t.co/wmwaD7wvgkBottom of the 4th: Democrats 10, Republicans 1! #CongressionalBaseballGame https://t.co/L7fqcMDVu8An RBI for Dems! #congressionalbaseball @RepJeffries https://t.co/nAxsKfpT6VWe’re ready! #CongressionalBaseballGame https://t.co/qQ6bDS4KLPExcited to represent Texas’ 33rd in my @TexasWesleyan gear at tonight’s #CongressionalBaseballGame! #RamsUp https://t.co/AwZ5Z7McTuDenying over 10 million Texans access to affordable health care because of their prior medical conditions is unacceptable and once again shows the Trump Administration's complete lack of empathy for American hard working families. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/9uDGDw9oqwFor 241 years, the US flag has served as a symbol of freedom across the world. More than just stars and stripes, our flag represents the values of compassion and justice we hold dear as Americans, Today, we are reminded that no matter our politics, we are one nation. #FlagDay https://t.co/40cWJKot0tWe are happy to have you back @SteveScalise! #CBG18 https://t.co/RTSrm5YZeIGetting in some last minute batting practice at @Nationals park before the #Congressionalbaseball game.

Tune in for a behind the scenes look into the action on and off the field and sneak peaks into the dugout. Feel a win coming! https://t.co/cvfjHMKepVThe Trump Justice Department is doing the @HouseGOP’s bidding – taking away healthcare for Texans that need access to care the most. It’s another despicable decision lacking in basic human empathy by this Administration. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/FJUE3uYceZLast year, the @HouseGOP voted to rip protections away from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. Now, the Trump DOJ is trying to do it again by urging the Texas courts to strike down a provision of the #ACA that jeopardizes the healthcare of millions of Texans.We cannot allow insurance companies to discriminate against the over 10 million Texans suffering from pre-existing conditions. It’s a direct attack on their health and livelihood. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/d6jXlKYOrWAgain, the time is now to act on family separation and comprehensive immigration reform. #KeepFamiliesTogetherI call on my colleagues to work together and find bipartisan long–term solutions that the business and immigration communities have been demanding happen for years.

We need to turn out in larger numbers than we ever have before, and elect representatives who will protect our sacred right to vote.As a lead plaintiff in the Veasey v. Abbott voter ID case, and founder of the Voting Rights Caucus in Congress, I’ve personally seen the barriers too many Americans face when casting a ballot. The cycle can’t continue.Upholding voter purging in Ohio greenlights other states to purge registered voters from their rolls as a way to suppress and undermine our basic right to vote. https://t.co/7Xj9iFchSbThe Supreme Court’s ruling today is a chilling decision with serious repercussions for democracy in this country. The National Voter Registration Act is one of our country's central voting rights laws, but this decision has opened the door to weaken the protections it provides.It is clear that now is the time for Congress to act and provide relief to the hundreds of thousands of Americans across our country. I call on my all colleagues to do what over 75% of Americans think is right and support a long term comprehensive solution for our #DREAMers.The DOJ’s decision not to defend #DACA in the courts jeopardizes the livelihood of over 120,000 Texans who are DACA recipients. They are our students, our doctors, our neighbors, and our friends.

We won’t stop fighting until women earn what they deserve. Let’s close the gap and pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct. 4/4If the annual wage gap were eliminated, a working woman in Texas would have enough money for: 

•15 additional months of child care;
•The full cost of tuition at a 2-year community college;
•78 more weeks of food; or
• Nearly 7+ months of mortgage and utilities payments. 3/4Minority women in Texas face an even greater wage gap. Black women in Texas are paid 58 cents and Latinas are paid 44 cents for every dollar paid to white men. 2/4 https://t.co/7XYt9To8IWJust 28 percent of U.S. working women say they are confident they are paid the same salaries as their male counterparts. On average, Texas women who are employed full time, lose a combined total of nearly $77 billion every year to the #wagegap. 1/4We need renewed talks on American counter-terrorism efforts in Africa. The heroic work of our 500 U.S. soldiers needs to be recognized by President Trump. His proposal to restructure the fed gov’t could make budget cuts to programs like @USAID. It’s a dangerously naive decision.My thoughts are with the family of the American special forces solider killed and four wounded service members who came under firefight with Shabaab militants in Somalia, where troops have been training local forces in countering the terrorist group.The #DFW Metroplex, has the highest uninsured rate of any Congressional District in the country. The Justice Department’s brief urging the Texas courts to strike down a provision of the #ACA jeopardizes the healthcare of millions of Texans, https://t.co/C1xzkzm2adIt is critical that North Texans across #DFW can get to and from work. Long commute times cut into time on the job and with family. The much needed improvements to @NTExpress will generate significant economic and mobility benefits for the Metroplex. https://t.co/gLjAh9dMuh.@TheJusticeDept’s decision to not defend the #ACA in #TX is a clear attack on the health of all Texans. All Americans deserve the right to access quality medical care regardless of their pre-existing conditions. We cannot deny care to Texans who need it the most.As the daughter of two immigrant parents, Pauline Valenciano, grew up knowing activism was her cause.

Working Americans were left behind by the #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/OtOivUPvWvThe Republican party wants to pay for the #GOPTaxScam, a tax break for the wealthiest Americans by cutting crucial benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. American working families deserve better.Today on #TaxDay, remember the #GOPTaxScam was falsely sold as a bill for the middle class. In Texas alone, the top 5% of earners get 65% of the tax breaks because of the Republican plan. https://t.co/oacb9tJNlwBest of luck to all the runners making the 26.2 mile trek in Boston today from Texas' 33rd! Make us proud! #BostonMarathonIf confirmed, Marine Corps Col. Lorna M. Mahlock will be the first black woman to ever serve as brigadier general. With women still only making up 8% of the Marine Corps, Col. Lorna M.

We acknowledge our moral obligation to fight against anti-semitism,  fight against all forms of hatred and utter the words #NeverAgain. https://t.co/epM6DCfAWLLet today serve as a call to action for us to push past partisanship, to ensure Americans are paid equal pay for equal work and to finally close the gender wage gap. #EqualPayDayIn Texas alone, on average women earn 79 cents for every dollar their male counterpart makes.

The numbers are not better for women of color. Black women earn 58 cents to the dollar. Latinas earn 44 cents to the dollar.  

We can and must do better. #EqualPayForEqualWorkClosing the #GenderWageGap isn’t a women’s issue. Women not earning equal pay for equal work impacts our families, businesses and our economy. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/tWTOdwocVN#EqualPayDay marks the number of days into the next year women on average would need to work to earn the same amount their male counterparts made in the previous year. Today, we recognize the steps we still must take to ensure all Americans earn equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/Hl7Y9ki62PIt's in fact great news!

So encouraging to meet w/ young people who want to know how to engage their elected officials. Can't wait to see what these future leaders achieve! #FortWorth https://t.co/PBK6sMosuFMy thoughts and prayers are with the victims, families, and the state of Florida after today's horrific event..@POTUS, @HouseGOP, @SenateGOP:

Roses are Red,
Violets are Blue,
#DREAMers are Americans,
Just like You. ❤We need an #InfrastructurePlan that makes daily life easier for America’s hard-working families, not one that makes your family foot the bill with more taxes and tolls.President Trump’s mediocre $200 billion #InfrastructurePlan leaves states, cities, and local governments to foot the bill and puts additional pressure on their budgets that are already stretched too thin.It’s no secret that fixing our nation’s crumbling roads, bridges, and railroads remain a priority for both sides of the aisle. Where Ds &amp; Rs differ is in our approach to spur job growth &amp; our commitment to ensuring the economic benefits from any plan reach the middle class 1stHow do you think @POTUS should honor our service members and our veterans? I have a few ideas but I want to hear from you. #PARADEAct.@POTUS let me give you a few ideas you can actually advocate to recognize our service members.
-additional resources for the VA
-military spouse support
-ending veteran homelessness 
-prevention of veteran suicideThe PARADE Act makes sure that @POTUS does not take his personal feuds with authoritarian leaders from Twitter onto the streets of our nation.The PARADE Act ensures that @POTUS cannot spend millions &amp; millions of taxpayer dollars on a military parade that strokes his big ego and his authoritarian wish list.Today I introduced the PARADE Act b/c I'm tired of @POTUS treating the military and veterans as his political prop. 

PARADE = 
Preventing 
Allocation of 
Resources for 
Absurd 
Defense 
Expenditures https://t.co/fu5wMmEeiQAs a @HASCDemocrats, I'm concerned that @POTUS' desire for a #militaryparade has more to do w/ indulging his authoritarian tendencies than honoring our fallen soldiers or advocating for ways we can provide meaningful assistance to service members’ needs here @ home &amp; abroad. https://t.co/3QR46SCrss#WithABuckFiftyAWeek my constituents can't even buy a #DART or #TheT ticket to get to work. @SpeakerRyan plz share w/ hardworking families where the majority of the $1.5 billion #GOPTaxScam actually went. B/c it obviously didn't go to their paychecks as you claimed.Sending my thoughts and prayers to my Republican colleagues onboard today's West Virginia train accident and to the family who @CNN is now reporting lost a loved one in the crash.Then why do you continue to stack against the average American family? A #TaxScam where less than 2% of Americans report a bonus like you claimed doesn't sound like you're making the American Dream any more achievable. Dems want to invest in Americans -- not just CEOs. #SOTU https://t.co/bCgsP2DtM7As @POTUS looks into the gallery tonight, I hope he locks eyes w/ my #SOTU guest, Ms. Charmion Polk - a retired @FortWorth_ISD teacher who inspired so many thru the King's Kids initiative - teaching us all that we must lead w/ compassion &amp; respect to achieve justice for all https://t.co/IzCqik2GPD.@POTUS turned his back on America's workers, and his tax cuts will increase the very things he rallied against as a candidate – sending MORE jobs overseas and increasing the trade deficit #AYearOfTrumpPresident Trump is master of “Art of the Fail”: Despite @POTUS’ vows to save jobs, Carrier laid off 215 more workers from Indiana plant. Where was the great dealmaker when Indiana's workers needed him? https://t.co/gUVeUFyyY8Work OT? Saving for retirement? Trying to get a raise? Trump doesn’t care. #AYearOfTrump: @POTUS &amp; his Wall Street cronies rolled back an Obama-era overtime rule that would have raised pay for more than 4 million hardworking Americans.Plain and simple -- @POTUS turned his back on the American worker. From a massive tax giveaway that does little to help the average family to making it less safe for those on the job, Trump failed! Workers deserve #ABetterDeal https://t.co/g1YbdudfKBLet’s add this to the list of #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout during tonight’s #SOTU when it comes time to discuss the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/ivtd2ADKvuLet us remember the millions of Jews who perished in the #Holocaust &amp; commit to the fight against hate and anti-Semitism. #WeRemember “There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.” Elie Wiesel https://t.co/zYmUPYwn68@leia @spcaoftexas She is great!

More info here: https://t.co/O1qBh1BxRl Deadline: 1/26/18There is no such thing as a "good government shutdown." @realDonaldTrump should be ashamed for suggesting that Ds are responsible when Rs control all 3 branches of gov't. #TrumpShutdownThe priorities Americans want to see addressed (pensions, DREAMers, health care for kids, etc) aren’t controversial. So why did Republicans choose a #TrumpShutdown over these bipartisan ideas?I’m sick &amp; tired of watching as Republicans treat governing like a game. The #TrumpShutdown will not help ANYONE in my district. @HouseDemocrats are ready to negotiate but @POTUS keeps moving the goal post to appease his base #DoYourJob!Republicans had no problem spending all their time &amp; votes on tax breaks for corporations &amp; the wealthiest. Now, they have no energy to fund #CHIP, #ProtectDREAMers, or pass a budget. @HouseDemocrats don't buy it. #TrumpShutdownIt’s fitting that the 1 year anniversary of @realDonaldTrump’s inauguration is also the first day of the GOP’s #TrumpShutdown. #AYearOfTrumpDespite that GOP has control of all 3 branches of gov't, they're proving they can't govern on their own. They need to quit holding #CHIP, #DREAMers &amp; disaster relief funding hostage to push their anti-immigrant agenda &amp; pass a clean CR to avoid a #TrumpShutdown.@POTUS said the gov't could benefit "from a good shutdown". @HouseDemocrats don't want that. We want to fund critical bipartisan overdue priorities like #CHIP, veterans care, #DREAMAct &amp; need @HouseGOP to work w/ us to get it done. https://t.co/j1dNE0Ru3qApprenticeships are valuable opportunities for students to earn while they learn valuable &amp; in-demand needed skills. Thank you to @Microsoft @Aon_plc &amp; several others for sharing their insights w/ @HouseDemocrats so we can work to get a #ABetterDeal for ALL Americans. https://t.co/lYQOB6FvRBFamily is an American value, but @POTUS administration is seeking to drastically cut family immigration. Congress must #ValueOurFamilies. https://t.co/6xHeCv0ktIImmigrants who come as family are workers, entrepreneurs, caregivers, teachers, and neighbors. #ValueOurFamilies #NoFamilyBanTune in shortly as I join @cnni at 2:15 PM CT / 3:15 PM EST to share my thoughts on @POTUS' shortcomings and the (little) he's accomplished during his 1st year in office.Joining @wolfblitzer @CNN in just a few minutes. We'll be discussing #DACA, Trump's racist remarks &amp; Hawaii's false missile alert.Now more than ever Martin Luther King’s words ring true. We must continue to be inspired and lead the charge against inequality. May his words continue to guide our hearts when faced with moments of injustice, bigotry and racism. #MLKDayTune in @ 1:45PM CT on @MSNBC w/@davidgura to discuss the latest on #votingrights and @realDonaldTrump's racist rant against #immigrants.Last night's #DACA ruling doesn't change the fact that Congress needs to come together &amp; pass a #DREAMActNow. We can't afford to let #Dreamers down..@POTUS keeps breaking up immigrant families. 1st Nicaragua, Honduras, &amp; Haiti. Today's decision to not #SaveTPS = 30k Salvadoreans w/ TPS living in TX will no longer be able to work, study, etc. TPS holders are biz owners, teachers, mothers, &amp; fathers. We must find a solution! https://t.co/4OjERxaO3sGood riddance! @POTUS phony voter fraud commission was nothing more than a smoke and mirrors attempt to suppress the minority #voteThe revote on the #GOPTaxScam doesn't change the fact that a bad bill, is a bad bill, is a bad bill. https://t.co/soEBFijEtPIt’s clear that the billionaire wish list has been met.
