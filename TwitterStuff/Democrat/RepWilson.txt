I applaud @MDCPS for earning an A rating for the very first time. There also were no F-rated traditional schools for the second year in a row. Well done!Like @repcleaver, we must all do our part to help keep faith alive that we will #BringBackOurGirls! https://t.co/8BcIfmflCsMy thoughts are with the #CapitalGazetteShooting victims and their families. It is past time for Congress to act. EnoughIsEnough!It is day 1537 of captivity for 112 #ChibokGirls. Thank you, @RepKeithEllison, @RepDwightEvans @RepBRochester @RepLawrence @RepAnthonyBrown, and all of my other colleagues who express support for the #ChibokGirls. #BBOG"It's a great blessing if one can lose all sense of time, all worries, if only for a short time, in a book." ― Nella Last https://t.co/saiM6UPODwAmerican children are watching and they want to know why @realDonaldTrump is taking children from their parents. We have to keep the pressure on and if we do nothing else, we need to pass the Family Unity Right and Protection Act that I so proudly cosigned. @RepKarenBass #FURPA https://t.co/YX8L71BXGBRicky, 18, and Zoe, 12, are just two of the phenomenal young people in District 24 who are setting an example for young people across the U.S. by fighting for causes they believe in and that help others. Seeing them today in our nation’s capital has made my day and I am so proud! https://t.co/mPg0WeKhqsRicky Pope, a member of @5000RoleModels, surprised me in the U.S. Capitol today after votes. He is in Washington with @Team_Enough lobbying lawmakers on gun violence prevention and I couldn't be prouder! https://t.co/4CKmxcuPDUIt was so uplifting to meet my young constituent Zoe, age 12, who traveled to Washington to participate in a #FamiliesBelongTogether rally across from the White House. Children around the nation are paying attention to @realDonaldTrump's inhumane policies and asking, "Why?" https://t.co/vkvkfbXAGQToday I joined @RepKarenBass and more than 60 of my colleagues to push for the passage of the Family Unity Rights and Protection Act, which would require the federal government to take responsibility for reunifying the families it separated. #FURPA #FamiliesBelongTogether! https://t.co/rx3cgSutNs2,000 kids may never see their parents again unless the Trump administration takes responsibility to reunify these families. Proud to introduce the Family Unity Right and Protection Act with @RepKarenBass to force the reunification of these families. https://t.co/qkoa76sWNlThe Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance’ policy has caused lifelong trauma to children and their families. We must outlaw the practice of separating families and we must put the onus on the government to reunify these families. #FURPA https://t.co/09UQtRmYEgProud to support legislation to require the federal government to take responsibility for reunifying the families they separated. #FURPA  #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/Q2O0ILQzBfThe separation of families at the border by the Trump Administration is abhorrent and inhumane. Today, I’m joining @RepKarenBass and many of my colleagues to introduce the Family Unity Right and Protection Act to demand that families are reunited. #FURPA https://t.co/mXzrddwsZbThank you to everyone for making National HIV Testing Day a huge success! Pro active in saving lives in District 24!       A special expression of gratitude to @Walgreens and @GreaterThanAIDS for their continued partnerships! https://t.co/OwL3rxubqFI'm relieved that Speaker Paul Ryan’s so-called “compromise” immigration bill failed miserably today, but disappointed that it was not because 112 Republicans recognized that the legislation is punitive and anathema to our American values.
https://t.co/xvAkLldIgCThank you. on behalf of the 112 #ChibokGirls still missing, for your support, @RepCummings! It is a great comfort to their families to know that members of Congress want to #BringBackOurGirls! https://t.co/Rg7gyDhYybThank you, @RepDarrenSoto for standing up for the #ChibokGirls. 112 are still missing and we can't give up until we #BringBackOurGirls! https://t.co/FWNk9pIzlnThere is still time when you leave work for the day to go to your local Walgreens in our District in Miami and get a FREE HIV Test! Please take care of you! ⁦@Walgreens⁩ ⁦@GreaterThanAIDS⁩ https://t.co/i4H16RjSOsRebuilding the America’s unions is central to rebuilding the American middle class. It’s a shame to see the Supreme Court fall for conservative efforts to take advantage of workers in the #Janus case.One in five public school teachers have second jobs during the school year. We should be doing more to help them – not taking away tools that help them win a better future. #JanusThere is a Walgreens close by for you to have your free HIV Test completed in 15 minutes for free in my great district today! ⁦@Walgreens⁩ ⁦@GreaterThanAIDS⁩ https://t.co/7EVB0RXl0pFree HIV Testing Today in District 24!

Even worse, they deported some moms and dads before they were able to recover their children. This can't stand! We must #KeepFamiliesTogether! https://t.co/nYV9iLYzfCTomorrow is National HIV Testing Day! Walgreens, Greater Than AIDS and I have partnered to provide everyone in District 24 free HIV Testing!

https://t.co/k3kCO4wHL2Shelby, Korematsu, Dred Scott, and now, Trump v. Hawaii. Today's decision joins a line of rulings history will look back on in shame. #WeWillNotBeBanned #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/KcPHzYsIXcHistory will look back on today's #SCOTUS decision as one where the court endorsed discrimination. RT if you agree: #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/59fKW1nfbETomorrow is National HIV Testing Day! Get tested and know your status!

https://t.co/k3kCO4wHL2Religious freedom is a core American value. Today's decision flies in the face of that and puts the religious liberty of ALL Americans at risk. Join people of all faiths on the #SCOTUS steps at 11:45 today to affirm that #wewillnotbebanned. https://t.co/xjIhic8dq4 https://t.co/21Z6tobNjQPlease join me on Wednesday, June 27, in observance of National HIV Testing Day.

Know your status!The bottom line is how and when will these families be reunited? https://t.co/73youKKL76How will separated children and parents be reunited? Good question! The Trump administration must own the consequences of their inhumane family separation policy and work to reunite families. https://t.co/4z1YzGuaPpPresident Trump's cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reuniting them.

https://t.co/fvyl4OnM8vICYMI: https://t.co/aJaOb5098hIn Case You Missed It: https://t.co/Dz57VTCtVyI hope that the children I visited at the Brownsville and Homestead detention centers know how much I care and that they have an advocate in me. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThank you for tying up the White House switchboard. Because of your action, the president has changed his action on separating families. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/qPVpmYDEpOMy visit to the Homestead facility was eye-opening and made me more determined than ever to fight to #KeepFamiliesTogether!We found the girls at the Homestead facility. Lots of adolescent girls are housed there  We gave them balloons and I hope to visit them again. We let the girls know that we love them. 🎈🎈🎈 https://t.co/tKBSxiOoBYIt is important to note that the migrant parents and their children detained by our government are being held by different federal agencies. Merging the two databases to reunify these families could pose a major challenge, but it's a challenge we must meet! RT if you agree! https://t.co/lze97oSUnQWhat is happening to migrant children is devastating and we have to keep fighting for them. @FLOTUS should spearhead the effort to reunite families. #FamilesBelongTogetherAppearing on @amjoyshow in a few moments!

Babies need to stay with their loving parents. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct stops the #Trump administration's government sanctioned child abuse policy. https://t.co/SAa907TWxfThe #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct establishes a preference for family unity, discourages the separation of siblings, and creates a presumption that detention is not in the best interests of families and children. https://t.co/9hEky3SsrJFACT: The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct defers the prosecution of parents who are asylum seekers and adopts the recommendation of the @DHSgov Office of Inspector General. https://t.co/lI7njrqM0OFACT: Family separation has been universally condemned by the child welfare community, immigration rights community, and medical professionals such as the American Pediatrics Association. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct https://t.co/gmZ1kCnvmBhttps://t.co/p0mKLp5sXphttps://t.co/1oXYJ2CDT3https://t.co/Rsbi8VSPHZWhat about the thousands of children who've already been torn from their parents?

Well guess what: ​#WEBELONGHERE https://t.co/IUIQlawc2oSeeking asylum in is not illegal, in fact, it is written into US laws to ensure that those with a credible fear of persecution can present their case.

After 4 days in custody, he was separated from his son &amp; moved 1,000 miles away. In what world is this ok? https://t.co/6DkxxPUaRwThe practice of separating children from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane &amp; cruel. Seeking asylum is not illegal, in fact, it is written into US immigration laws to ensure that those w/a credible fear of persecution can present their case..@DHSgov denied that they were breaking the sacred bond between parents and children until the @NYT reported that more than 700 children have been separated from their moms &amp; dads since October. https://t.co/eP2OF5G9u9I would like to know, too. https://t.co/Sd0S8StLKGWhat they want and so desperately need are their parents! #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/lApJpq8vc2Seriously. This new "safeguarding against human trafficking" excuse is a stretch as long as the border. https://t.co/0763EfOgwmThis video will erase any doubts you may have had about the origins of the horrendous policy to separate immigrant children from their parents. It is NOT the law and it was NOT created or put in place by Democrats. We believe that #FamiliesBelongTogether! RT and spread the word! https://t.co/7SIjhNMNSa.@realDonaldTrump needs to head to Texas to visit the children being detained and see with his eyes their pain, their grief and their suffering. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/vnCnB8mUAjAfter visiting Brownsville today, I am angry, I am ashamed, I’m appalled. This must end. I am calling on @realDonaldTrump, the most powerful man in the world, to end this policy today, end the pain, end the grief. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/hgz8L6mk8XI absolutely agree that it is cruel, inhumane and indecent to separate children from their families. @realDonaldTrump is the one person who has the power to stop this policy and stop their pain.
