I will only support a tax plan that reflects what‚Äôs best for #NY09. Your voices matter.The tax bill should be a reflection of the needs of the average American. Instead, the #GOPTaxScam ensures that the 1% is protected, while the middle &amp; working class suffers from 20% deductions &amp; the corporate tax rate being lowered from 35% to 21%, @SethHanlon reminds us.The GOP tax bill scams the majority of Americans, except for big businesses and the 1%. Small businesses owned by people of color and the middle class will be the first businesses hit by the #GOPTaxScam.Brooklyn is a hub for small businesses. From restaurants to tech startups to art galleries, and more, our local economy is driven by the success of small businesses.The #GOPTaxScam puts the benefits that hard-working Americans deserve directly into the pockets of corporations.‚Äú50% of NY State tax cuts will go to the wealthiest 5%.‚Äù -Nicole Gill, @taxmarch.

Name a woman that inspires you. #replytweetThank you, @MichelleObama and Parker for adding joy to my timeline today. https://t.co/aiaTIYIk4y. @RepGregoryMeeks @RepJoseSerrano and I, along with our co-signers @repjoecrowley @RepEspaillat are unified around making #affordablehousing accessible in New York and beyond. Check out the press release below on the #HardestHitAct. https://t.co/ghknhBxjTXLet‚Äôs talk housing. 45‚Äôs budget cuts reduced federal funding from housing programs that are crucial to our communities. For this reason @RepGregoryMeeks, @RepJoseSerrano &amp; I introduced the #HardestHitAct to secure @HUD with the funds needed to make #affordablehousing accessible. https://t.co/MCElsQejCwOn the anniversary of #BloodySunday, I would like to recognize my friend @repjohnlewis.  He was the 1st beaten for the peaceful protests in Selma to ensure our voting rights. Decades later, he is a powerful voice of marginalized groups in U.S. Congress. Because of him, we can.Today is the 53rd anniversary of #BloodySunday where Civil Rights activists were tear-gassed and beaten in #Selma in order to pass the #VotingRightsAct. The fight for voting rights is more important now than ever.I‚Äôm thinking of my Ghanian friends and constituents, and their beautiful nation as they celebrate 61 years of independence today! üá¨üá≠üá¨üá≠üá¨üá≠ #GhanaIndependence‚ÄúWhat does it mean to #ProtectDreamers?‚Äù Special thanks to my constituent Hina Naveed, an accomplished registered nurse and #DACA recipient for sharing her story. https://t.co/WSouPIkQzbThe Supreme Court's decision on #DACA does not lessen the urgent need for Congress to act. We have a moral duty to address the humanitarian crisis 45 created by ending the #DACA program. #ProtectDreamersCongratulations to @JordanPeele on making history &amp; becoming the first African-American to win the Academy Award for #BestOriginalScreenplay for #GetOut.  Let this serve as a reminder that #RepresentationMatters, and as an inspiration for us to continue telling our own stories. https://t.co/gpjPr08TVvMy Senator! Thank you, @SenGillibrand.

Purim Sameach!@Sangluii @sxsw Will be there Saturday &amp; Sunday. What about you?I‚Äôm glad to see that some of you are coming to @sxsw! To my fellow Brooklynites attending, would you like to join me for coffee in Austin? #replytweet #BrooklynStandUp #YDCinSXSW https://t.co/5DuocYQhTvToday, I‚Äôm thinking of Ellie Helton. She passed at age 14 of a brain aneurysm &amp; is the inspiration behind my bill #ElliesLaw, which would authorize $25M in federal funding for brain aneurysm research. #BrainInjuryAwareness is crucial b/c it could save lives &amp; help those in need.Did you know March was #BrainInjuryAwareness Month? I will be using this month and beyond to recognize those with brain injuries and their families. Let's strategize ways to work together to make their lives easier and to make the resources needed more accessible to all.That‚Äôs what I like to hear! Congrats @ReignOfApril. Thank you for reminding us that #RepresentationMatters and for fighting for equality for POC in Hollywood and beyond. https://t.co/HsOGkAHj6OICYMI‚Äî the Caribbean-Central American Action Summit starts on Monday in D.C.

I‚Äôm going to @sxsw to chat all things telecom and tech with @Dell.

Since then, 180,000 Americans have joined to serve in 134 nations. Thanks to the #PeaceCorps staff and volunteers for their commitment to bettering this world. https://t.co/dT58fPjm4fHoli is the day to strengthen the bond of friendship and to add more colors and joy to it. I hope everyone celebrating enjoys the festival to its fullest. 

Happy Holi! https://t.co/npK4Q53cfbI am a co-sponsor of the #ThompsonKing Background Checks Bill because it is our job in Congress to #EndGunViolence for the well-being and safety of the American people, our children, and our future generations.Proud to join @RepThompson &amp; @HouseGVP as a co-sponsor of the #ThompsonKing Background Checks Bill. 200 Representatives aren‚Äôt afraid of the gun lobby. We are willing to pass a bipartisan bill that strengthens the system &amp; keeps guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.This #WomensHistoryMonth, I am reflecting upon all of the amazing women of power in my District. Congratulations to Aisha Carr, recipient of the Caribbean Lifestyle &amp; Business Management Award for her phenomenal work with Sesame Flyers Intl. You make us proud! https://t.co/N1p3ZKM3sVLast night was an amazing transition from #BHM to #WomensHistoryMonth‚Äî I was inducted into the Alumni Hall of Fame of the Young, Gifted &amp; Black Entrepreneurial Awards and received the Political Advocacy and Leadership award. I do it all for Brooklyn. What an honor! https://t.co/Sd112e9TF8Shirley Chisholm deserves a permanent place among other defining figures in the Capitol. Representation matters. My sister-colleague, @SenKamalaHarris, and I are going to make sure it happens. #ChisholminUSCapitol https://t.co/aluXHXScujWe're in the midst of a crippling housing crisis. Rent &amp; homelessness are at an all time high. Trump's budget decimates affordable housing programs and members of his Cabinet are buying...luxury furniture?

Shameful. 

https://t.co/nsuuJsDsYv¬°Feliz D√≠a de la Independencia Dominicana! I send my blessings to my Dominican friends, colleagues, and constituents on this day. üá©üá¥üá©üá¥üá©üá¥Still monitoring the situation that happened earlier today at Church of God of Prophecy. Praying for those impacted and grateful for Kings County Hospital staff and FDNY for keeping my constituents safe. https://t.co/C4Re6SLua2America is a country that believes everyone should have their day in court - even immigrants. This ruling is unjust and inhumane. https://t.co/8ceQA27TaO45's use of the term "chain migration" rather than 'family reunification' is a divisive &amp; harmful dog whistle for the Alt-Right. Millions of families waiting for the @GOP to act. We must give these families the chance to pursue the American Dream. #SaveTPS #DREAMers #ASPIRETPSAnd I don‚Äôt have to remind you why he‚Äôs attacked #TPS. I introduced #ASPIRETPS Act w/ @RepJayapal &amp; Rep. @roslehtinen which would protect eligible immigrants who need to escape life-threatening conditions in their home countries make a home here in U.S.¬†
#DREAMers #DACA #SaveTPS45 created the #DACA crisis. He chose to put the families through turmoil. His vulgar and disgraceful rhetoric towards black immigrants, inconsistencies, and inability to govern have caused uncertainty and fear among #DREAMers and their families.¬†He owns this chaos. https://t.co/spUP7dMRoFSCOTUS' decision not to expedite Trump's DACA challenge is welcome news. 45's decision to end DACA was legally questionable, unjust, and downright foolish. Now it's up to Congress to fix it.

by billionaires to divide workers &amp; make it harder to stick together in unions. I stand with working
