If you are a parent, it's hard to say how this is fair. There's no other area of the law where this happens. H.R. 2043 would help protect these children and other vulnerable groups in immigration proceedings by ensuring access to legal counsel. https://t.co/MNqCNsNmrfGreat to meet with Brianna Mims today, a San Jose native and McNair Scholar attending Cornell University https://t.co/1JQc1ch18uI agree with Justices Sotomayor and Ginsberg who concluded that this #SCOTUS decision “merely replaces one ‘gravely wrong’ decision with another. https://t.co/8Jsrs2pXekI'm deeply disappointed the #SCOTUS majority failed to give sufficient weight to Trump’s stated anti-Muslim intent in issuing his travel ban. As a country of immigrants that has been a refuge for people from around the world, this decision is contrary to who we are as a nation.The Family Case Management Program (eliminated by Trump) was an effective community supervision program that secured a near 100% court appearance rate for asylum-seekers. If Trump actually cared about ensuring compliance with the law, he could simply reinstate that program.The solution to family separation is not locking kids in prison with their parents. The Flores settlement is in place for a reason, which is that indefinite incarceration of children in prisons is not a good thing and not consistent with American values. https://t.co/45W1KP9Q05The Trump Administration's enforcement of their cruel “zero-tolerance” policy is a clear contradiction to the values and beliefs the United States represents #KeepFamliesTogether https://t.co/tK2r9ZaIRWHow can the United Sates represent hope and opportunity to immigrants across the world while the Trump Administration continues to enforce their cruel “Zero-tolerence” policy? #KeepFamliesTogetherToday I joined my colleagues in condemning the Trump Administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions' "zero-tolerance" policy, which tears children from their parents. Child abuse does not make America great. https://t.co/GCmtomWXwNWhat an embarrassingly poor display of diplomacy from President Trump at the #G7 summit.

If those same members don't sign a similar letter now, we can ask whether they believe the rule of law and the prescriptions of the Constitution apply only to Presidents of an opposing political party, but not to those of their ownI plan to once again lead an effort with my colleagues expressing that same sentiment in a letter to President Trump. The Constitution and the War Powers Resolution apply as much to one President as they do the next.Here’s that letter. As it states, the responsibility to authorize military force against a sovereign nation “is prescribed in the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973." https://t.co/kBHdcXBoC2In 2013, while President Obama weighed a military strike on Syria in response to Assad’s use of chemical weapons on civilians, 140 members of the House – Republicans and Democrats – sent a letter asserting that Congress must authorize any use of military force. https://t.co/1koOvz3j8TThe Trump Administration ignored these concerns and issued a policy that prioritizes mass deportation and mass detention over common sense and humanity. This is an anti-woman, anti-immigrant and anti-family policy. It is mean spirited, unnecessary and it should be reversed.And worse, the medical neglect of pregnant women in immigration detention was well documented in a recent administrative complaint to the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil LibertiesThe detention of pregnant women is particularly concerning because these centers often experience outbreaks of chicken pox, tuberculosis and other highly contagious diseases that can have life threatening consequences for the mother and baby.The so-called “pro-life” Trump Administration’s decision to detain pregnant women is shameful. Pregnant women need specialized medical care and immigration detention facilities are not equipped to provide specialized obstetric care. https://t.co/nsT0v6Fv3VNice to see San Jose City Councilmember @Sergio4D2 drop by my Washington DC office this week! https://t.co/V44DIwsjwdAs Trump tours his border wall "prototypes" today, it's worth remembering what President Reagan said: “Rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems?” #WallsDontWorkClearly, the Trump Administration isn't going to let facts get in the way of their anti-immigrant narrative: https://t.co/1ZApm1PLrJIf @realDonaldTrump wants elections with "paper backup" - House Democrats have a bill for that!

Today, the Election Security Task Force is releasing a report on the threats facing our elections and how best Congress can address them, watch live here: https://t.co/p4yp2zsXPwLeader Pelosi has been speaking on the House floor for over four hours, reading letters from DREAMers and demanding @SpeakerRyan bring up bipartisan legislation to protect #DACA recipients #GoNancyGo https://t.co/TIRHQlAgb6Joining @wolfblitzer in a moment to talk about the Russia investigation and Nunes memo. Tune in on @CNNPreparing for the State of the Union Address tonight #SOTU https://t.co/bLm3PkZ5Z8The President’s view to the contrary is ignorant as well as bigoted. All Americans need to speak out to condemn this outrageous statement and this wrong-headed opinion.I am ashamed, embarrassed and outraged by President Trumps comments reported in the Washington Post. As an American whose ancestors came from Scandinavia I know well that doesn’t make me a better American than those whose families came from Africa, Haiti or Latin America.Today @realdonaldtrump once again showed America that his fundamental guiding principle is hate. #cleandream #nohate https://t.co/hRXujN0aolWe reject @realdonaldtrump's attempts to divide immigrant communities by race, religion and nationality #cleandream #nohate https://t.co/hRXujN0aolMany of America's best and brightest come from countries @realdonaldtrump denigrates. #shame #nohate https://t.co/hRXujN0aolAmericans disappointed by today's #FISA vote should remember that, while #Section702 reform did not pass, it was DEMOCRATS - by a greater than 2-1 margin - who voted to protect the 4th Amendment and stand up for Americans #privacy rights. https://t.co/6uh23FUa9YImportant to remember: USA RIGHTS will NOT prevent the IC from uncovering plots against the US and saving potential hostages – it includes an exception to rescue hostages, as well as an EMERGENCY provision that allows the government to search first and seek a warrant later.Proud to join a bipartisan, bi-cameral group introducing the Amash-Lofgren amendment today to protect 4th amendment rights, protect our privacy, and close the "backdoor search" loophole which allows the government to spy on Americans without a warrant. #section702 https://t.co/lDl8YgyPgrBut we are not going to allow this without a fight. The Amash-Lofgren amendment to S. 139 would prevent law enforcement from accessing this information without first obtaining a warrant, and would protect the immigrant community from the Trump Administration’s deportation agenda.It also fails to prohibit the use of information collected by Section 702 in any Administrative proceedings, including #immigration courts.In fact, the Trump Administration has already begun attempts to prosecute parents of #immigrant children and this bill would give them an expansive tool to separate families.S. 139 would allow the Trump Administration to use this powerful tool against DREAMers and others without immigration status.This bill is supported by the Trump Administration, and nothing would stop the communications collected, stored, and accessed by law-enforcement agencies from being used as a weapon against #immigrant families for investigation, detention, and deportation.The House will vote on reauthorizing #section702 surveillance tomorrow. This program collects communications - including emails, phone calls, text messages, photos, and more - of individuals inside in the United States who communicate with individuals outside the United States.In the short term, Trump may appease his base with this decision, but the continued degradation of our humanitarian immigration policies will have long-lasting impact on the success and prosperity of our Nation. https://t.co/2XXUicAq2qEconomic analysis suggests that today’s decision to deport Salvadoran #TPS holders will cost the United States $31 billion over the next 10 years. You can read that analysis here: https://t.co/TKuhcn0RNA https://t.co/b9tISe4gDjThis will not just affect Salvadorans, but also their U.S. citizen spouses and children, the American employers and employees who depend on them, and the countless communities across the Unites States they helped build and live in today. https://t.co/0hoOz7ngW7It forces Salvadoran #TPS holders to reconcile the danger that will face their families and loved ones upon return to El Salvador, with the prospect of tearing their families apart, and the uncertainty of undocumented status in the United States. https://t.co/E33yg7RCnfYet in one stroke, today’s decision from President Trump rips legal #TPS status from nearly 200,000 Salvadorans, many of whom have spent decades legally in the United States, starting families, working, studying, and contributing to their communities. https://t.co/T7ETpnXLY4El Salvador has among the highest murder rates in the world, including one of the highest rates of femicide. In 2015, a woman was murdered every 16 hours in El Salvador. And from 2010 to 2013, 95 percent of murders in the region were unsolved or unprosecuted. https://t.co/hmOIYOqz6PPresident Trump’s decision to strip TPS from Salvadorans, many of whom have legally lived and worked in this country for decades, is shameful and wrong. My statement: https://t.co/JjcMX5rVK4The Internet was founded as a neutral platform that leveled the playing field for sending and receiving information. Today's harmful vote to repeal #NetNeutrality rules is totally contrary to the foundation and innovative spirit of the Internet.So far, at least 19 women have come forward to complain and allege that President Trump had committed acts of sexual assault against them.
