Celebrating today’s @PDXParksandRec grand opening of Cully Park with @OregonGovBrown, @LewFrederick, @AmandaFritzRN and @LivingCully partners. Great work by Cully community to create a fantastic park for NE PDX! https://t.co/xatqHFdlUfProud to stand with Oregonians of all ages at today’s #FamiliesBelongTogether rally in Portland coming together to use our 1st Amendment freedoms of assembly and speech to speak out &amp; push back against Donald Trump’s “zero-tolerance” cruelty. #FirstAmendmentWyden https://t.co/NZkQZLspoNFreedoms of assembly and speech are alive and well in Portland with today’s #FamiliesBelongTogether rally on the Park Blocks. A powerful example of speaking out and pushing back. #FirstAmendmentWyden https://t.co/IxhQXN6SN7This ruling is an important moment that shows the Trump administration does not have the authority to arbitrarily decide which Americans deserve health care. #ProtectOurCareThis is good news for Americans who think health care is a right, not a prize to be won after enduring piles of bureaucratic busy work designed to make life harder for people already walking an economic tightrope. 
https://t.co/AD5WRTuurM@realDonaldTrump I find it incredulous that someone can be under continuous audit unless they've been enormous mistakes on their returns over and over again. I find it hard to buy @realDonaldTrump's excuse..@realDonaldTrump says he's been under continuous audit and cannot release his tax returns. Rettig said he cannot recall anyone who has been under audit for over 10 years. #ReleaseTheReturns https://t.co/DgcK2bgs8rIf confirmed to lead the IRS, it's critical that Charles Rettig maintains political independence from the Trump White House and remains impartial and non-biased. 
https://t.co/NYpRgUG567Heard powerful accounts at @IRCOnews in PDX from religious/community leaders abt the importance of U.S. remaining safe haven for people fleeing religious persecution. Today is Day 1 for my statewide tour highlighting 1st Amendment freedoms. To follow the tour #FirstAmendmentWyden https://t.co/IUXO2jErnMThis “postcard” isn’t simple – It’s simply complicated. The middle class is not going to fall for this new #GOPTaxScam con.Trump’s new tax “postcard” is a smokescreen designed to conceal paperwork, additional calculations &amp; @realDonaldTrump’s broken promise to simplify the tax code. 
https://t.co/3sJV3w27D6The #GOPTaxScam was written by Republicans in Congress and the Trump admin to pick favorites and reward the wealthiest CEOs and shareholders – not workers. 
https://t.co/YxaXrQOLNfOregon farmers + hops = a recipe to create rural jobs &amp; top-flight craft brews craved around the globe. That’s an awesome recipe I’m proud to support:
https://t.co/m1v9pKlMNqMy bipartisan bill with @SenMajLdr, @SenJeffMerkley and @RandPaul will spur economic growth in rural communities by creating much-needed red, white, &amp; blue jobs that pay well.Legalizing hemp nationwide will end decades of bad policymaking and open up untold economic opportunity for farmers in Oregon &amp; across the country. #HempFarmingActBIG news for industrial hemp farming! Today, the Senate passed my bipartisan #HempFarmingAct, legislation that would lift a decades-old ban on growing industrial hemp on American soil. #RonReport https://t.co/r0fBzseRIhI’m proud to join my Senate colleagues to introduce the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act to create a better deal for workers. This bill would ensure American workers have the right to organize and bargain collectively for better wages. https://t.co/3vukf9qpYiChildren have been locked away under @realDonaldTrump’s “zero-humanity” policy in federal facilities across the country. It’s critical that Congress has access to ensure conditions are humane and appropriate, even if the policy is not.Members of Congress have a responsibility to ensure Americans’ tax dollars &amp; will are being executed properly. No admin should have the power to declare federal, taxpayer-funded facilities off-limits to oversight. https://t.co/Y8Mo0V2KLICosponsored in the Senate by @ChrisVanHollen &amp; @SenSanders, our bill allows members of Congress to fulfill their duty as the eyes and ears of the American people without interference from the executive branch. It calls for penalties if an agency denies a member access.Today, @JoaquinCastrotx and I introduced the Restoring Oversight for Members of Congress Act to provide immediate access to all federal facilities and federal operations. https://t.co/jyYYfB8ZtHI fully expect the president's nominee to receive the same consideration that Merrick Garland received..@SenateDems know that #FamiliesBelongTogether. I joined my Democratic colleagues for a hearing on the Trump admin’s cruel treatment of children separated from their families at the border. #ReuniteFamilies https://t.co/8cHtcdS0xXIt sure doesn’t look like Pharma is taking @realDonaldTrump seriously. Trump promised Pharma would lower prices. Instead, Pharma has been raising prices faster than the rate of inflation. https://t.co/3cTgAUTl7TI’m calling out @HHSgov @SecAzar’s absurd “hopes” that Pharma will voluntarily bring down prescription drug prices. https://t.co/Q2PGZ8SW1oIt’s @HHSGov’s responsibility to #ReuniteFamilies and make sure parents know where their kids are. Until the Trump administration has a plan, I’m going to keep asking pointed questions. https://t.co/2ar7IgJyHMOregonians know that everyone is better off when people can support their families. We must keep up the fight for fair bargaining rights in this Trump age of inequality. #SCOTUS https://t.co/bTUzlXEWLVTeachers, firefighters, police officers and all hardworking Americans deserve a fair shake at the good-paying wages and workplace protections unions have long provided workers.The #SCOTUS decision in #Janus v. AFSCME is an attack on #unions and equality for workers. https://t.co/rIbreNbyVrLaw enforcement spying shouldn’t disrupt 9-1-1 calls. Today, I asked @AjitPaiFCC about what testing the @FCC requires before it allows stingrays and similar surveillance tools to be sold to state and local governments.
https://t.co/RS4DXIxAezSo-called “crisis pregnancy centers” are deceptive and harmful to women’s health. Today, #SCOTUS made a decision to allow them to lie and prevent women from getting full information about the care they need and deserve. #EndTheLies  
https://t.co/jyFhQyMRjXNEW - The #GOPTaxScam tax giveaways to multinational corporations are driving huge federal debt, @USCBO says, opening the door to Republican attacks on #SocialSecurity and #Medicare. 
https://t.co/7u5RCVw5I3Democrats in Congress know #FamiliesBelongTogether, and we will keep fighting to #ReuniteFamilies separated by @realDonaldTrump and his administration at the border..@SecAzar: “There is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located.” That’s disconnected from reality. These parents are in cells, they’re not sitting at comfortable desks with computers and phones.How many parents ACTUALLY know where their kids are and when they’ll be reunited? A hotline is not the same thing as knowing where your kids are. @SecAzar and @HHSgov have a responsibility to #ReuniteFamilies the Trump administration separated at the border. https://t.co/zjrAlmTjvyToday’s #SCOTUS decision on the #MuslimBan goes against our American values. Policies of hate and discrimination do not belong in our country or anywhere ever. #CourtsMatter 
https://t.co/uN4xDPiMICThe American people are demanding action on lowering drug prices. Today, the Trump admin offered no action but absurd hopes that Pharma would do the right thing. https://t.co/FaAMP4sOOQBringing down prescription drug prices needs serious, bipartisan work. @realDonaldTrump said drug companies were “getting away with murder” with high costs, and a year and a half later, we’ve seen no action. https://t.co/qi0fQfEHXWRipping children away from their families and putting them in institutions is harmful to their health and scars their emotional well-being. @SecAzar, this is @HHSgov’s responsibility and yours too. #ReuniteFamilies https://t.co/aCnulsvfsjToday’s news is a win for good healthcare that is essential to quality of life in rural Oregon. https://t.co/ZqpHP5kRezGood rural health care is a must for quality of life in rural Oregon. That’s why I advocated for the Rural Health Care Program to increase resources for tele-health. Glad to say that’s now happened: https://t.co/LMrybHpzmmThe next time @AjitPaiFCC drops into Oregon, he’s welcome to attend a #2018townhall. I’d like him to hear directly from Oregonians in an open-to-all setting about how much they oppose his reversal of #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/3lSFfa0VOOAmericans deserve a health care system that works for everyone. I will keep fighting alongside my friends the @LittleLobbyists to make that a reality and STOP Republican health care sabotage. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/JUYl0ULpeZ.@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Congress continue to sabotage Americans’ health care by driving up premiums, undermining pre-existing condition protections &amp; going after Medicaid’s guarantee.Ryan Bounds, nominee for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, claimed that #LGBT Americans liked to “fancy [themselves] oppressed” and therefore see discrimination where it does not exist. Senate Judiciary Democrats voted no.  #PrideMonth #CourtsMatter https://t.co/wbZbpbitf3Confirming anti-LGBT Trump nominees to the bench is unacceptable and brings our country backwards. #CourtsMatterThis is what @realDonaldTrump wants to do to your health care.
 
Pre-existing condition protections: “gutting.”
 
Basic safeguards against insurance company greed: “gutted.”
 
Affordable health care: “gutted.”
 
It doesn’t get much clearer than that. https://t.co/ILu5hIrFvTICYMI: Here are 6 terrible truths about the #GOPTaxScam 6 months after the signing. #6MonthsofTaxScam https://t.co/NL4Zg1qRbZThe House #GOPFarmBill would make it harder for the 1 in 8  Americans who relies on #SNAP to get the food assistance they need. The Senate must fight this heartless attempt to implement paperwork requirements that will force hardworking Americans to go hungry. https://t.co/KPs3mRbxggThe asylum seekers detained at Sheridan’s federal prison MUST have access to legal counsel, representation, clergy and consistent medical care. https://t.co/buRoRtpaG8The court’s recognition of the fact that digital devices are fundamentally different is a validation of the vital protections against unreasonable search &amp; seizure provided by our Constitution. #SCOTUS #CarpenterThis is just the beginning. I’ve argued for years that the sheer volume of information about every single American that's collected by our phones &amp; computers requires a fundamental rethinking of the idea that giving your information to a company means the gov can get it too.BIG win for privacy today. #SCOTUS says the government must get a warrant to search Americans’ location information. #GetAWarrant #Carpenter 
https://t.co/4DL3NDGOghThis humanitarian crisis is not over. We need answers from @HHSgov &amp; @SecAzar about how the administration will ensure the safety, well-being &amp; reunification of the 2,300+ children who’ve been torn from their families in recent weeks. #ReuniteFamiliesMy @SenateFinance Democratic colleagues and I are demanding to know @realDonaldTrump and his admin’s plan to reunite children separated from their parents at the border. #ReuniteFamilies https://t.co/RfYiCOu2L8Congratulations to @Oregon_AFSCME workers on a successful contract w/ @VOAoregon. We need these types of agreements during this time of heightened attacks on workers. 
https://t.co/8qxqx7UR7v@stevenmnuchin1 I will continue to urge the highest levels of government to act on my bipartisan bill that cracks down on shell company abuse. The integrity of America’s financial structures are put at risk every day this administration stonewalls. https://t.co/XMdAXxXypZ.@stevenmnuchin1 gave me a commitment on day one to work with Congress to cut off the flow of dark money. Since then he hasn’t lifted a single finger to help bipartisan legislative efforts advance. 
https://t.co/3dRJyBtCYdIt should be an outrage to anybody who expects honesty from their government that @realDonaldTrump and his advisers won’t even stand up and defend their policy with honest answers. This is a national shame that will be remembered among the dark moments in our history.Many families coming to our country like mine did are seeking asylum and fleeing persecution. They’re facing cruelty and heartlessness from the Trump zero-tolerance policy. There’s no plan to reunite separated families whenever this nightmare ends. https://t.co/iKBTvjeFv3I’m headed to the Senate floor to speak out against Trump’s zero-tolerance policy and the treatment of asylum seekers in Oregon and at our border.Not all Jewish people were as fortunate. The “America First” movement considered Jews undesirable, and shiploads of Jews fleeing persecution and violence were turned away from the U.S. Many were forced back to Europe and many of them ended up in the concentration camps.On #WorldRefugeeDay, it’s more important than ever to reflect on the humanitarian values our country must uphold for people fleeing persecution. My own parents fled the horrors of Nazi Germany for the safety and promise of the U.S.  https://t.co/l9PAvOPMI6People power must keep the pressure on @realDonaldTrump to reverse course on all parts of his inhumane and un-American policies. Here’s an outline of what should and must happen: https://t.co/CAYxMKLzWs.@realDonaldTrump has made his underlying goals clear: Terrorize innocent refugee families and use them as political pawns to propel a racist agenda. This humanitarian crisis is not over.Locking families in cages together instead of locking children in cages without their parents marks a minor move from total inhumanity to moral bankruptcy. Children DO NOT belong behind bars.America is better than @realDonaldTrump's cruel and callous treatment of asylum seekers that rips apart families and denies them regular medical care or access to legal and spiritual counsel. What I saw at Sheridan was inhumane. https://t.co/bv11GTV7ULWhen I visited w/ some of the 123 asylum seekers dumped by the Trump admin at Sheridan federal prison, I heard heartbreaking &amp; harrowing accounts from men fleeing violence in Mexico &amp; Central America about their forced separation from spouses and children. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWhen serious questions about the misuse of charities are raised, @SenateFinance has never ducked. I wrote to Chairman @SenOrrinHatch about the need to investigate these abuses, including the Trump Foundation: https://t.co/K7BiVplHZfUPDATE -- less than a day after I made these letters public, every major wireless carrier says they will cut ties with the middlemen who sell your location information. Chalk one up for oversight and accountability getting results for consumers.#junkplans send premiums for real, comprehensive health care even higher &amp; leave families without good options. It’s time for the Trump admin and Republicans in Congress to STOP health care sabotage..@realdonaldtrump and his admin are opening the floodgates for #junkplans that make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to find affordable coverage &amp; easier for scam artists to make a quick buck at the expense of American families.@verizon @ATT While @Verizon &amp; @ATT have now pledged to stop selling customer location data to shady middlemen, @TMobile &amp; @sprint seem content to keep selling customers’ private information, Americans’ privacy be damned.After my investigation revealed abuses, @Verizon &amp; @ATT pledged to stop selling Americans’ location data to shady middlemen.
https://t.co/xmx8ANUWq9For some asylum-seekers, information about contacting lawyers had been left in their clothes, but their clothes weren't with them. America was built on respecting individual rights. There was no respect here.The asylum seekers I met at Sheridan's federal prison on Saturday have been lumped together and then dumped into prison. Some have been separated from their families. This needs to stop NOW. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/eiH13Rzl7iThis is WRONG, @SecNielsen, YOU can stop this inhumane treatment right now. https://t.co/PTLG6LwdcK.@realDonaldTrump's grotesque trampling on human rights must have zero place in America and in Oregon. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/4Syo6V6HTQWhen I visited Sheridan's federal prison on Saturday, I talked to a father whose 18-month-old daughter was torn from him and now, he doesn't know where she is..@realDonaldTrump has chosen a policy to rip asylum-seeking families apart and imprison children in metal cages. We cannot stand for this. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/elH8ohpiqpPress conference with @ThinkLawLab and @ACLU_OR  LIVE https://t.co/EZ6tzErKezTune in to my press conference with @ThinkLawLab and @ACLU_OR LIVE to hear what we’ve learned and actions going forward. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThis afternoon, I met with @ThinkLawLab and @ACLU_OR to discuss what we’ve learned about the treatment of asylum seekers at the federal prison in Sheridan. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWhat @SenJeffMerkley, @RepBonamici and @repblumenauer and I saw in Sheridan’s federal prison demonstrates that the Trump 'zero tolerance' policy makes zero sense and shows zero understanding of American values. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/zWCLlYigQ0.@realDonaldTrump’s choice of zero tolerance for the refugees we met today &amp; for the others imprisoned around the country this #FathersDay weekend makes zero sense &amp; shows zero understanding of American values. #FamiliesBelongTogetherAmerica must stand as the beacon of hope that welcomed our immigrant ancestors and creating the future we want for our children. #KeepFamiliesTogetherMy parents found refuge in America when they fled the terrors of Nazi Germany. @realDonaldTrump’s cruel and callous treatment of human beings seeking asylum is unconscionable and flies in the face of America’s humanitarian values. #KeepFamiliesTogetherI just visited with asylum seekers at Federal Correctional Institution in Sheridan. What I saw and heard today highlights the urgency of reversing @realDonaldTrump’s immoral, dangerous and traumatizing actions. https://t.co/OUcIrmiIisI just visited asylum seekers at the Federal Correctional Institution in Sheridan with @SenJeffMerkley, @RepBonamici and @repblumenauer. Watch our press conference. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/QoN7kdQShiThe grotesque Trump treatment - lumping detainees together, separating children from parents and dumping human-beings like waste into prisons. #FamiliesBelongTogetherSeparating kids and parents is fundamentally evil. These aren’t American values. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThe Trump treatment of refugees cannot stand. This is inhumane. I stand with @ACLU_OR. https://t.co/0mrDOFWDZuBut like other Trump trade actions, I'm concerned it was more impulsive than strategic. Since @realdonaldtrump took office, China has only imposed more trade barriers &amp; NAFTA talks are on life support.China’s unfair, disruptive trade tactics are an assault against American workers and American innovation. Workers need results. If today’s action marks the beginning of a coherent strategy that produces real change in China, I welcome it.Huge congrats to @OregonState for earning this opportunity from the @NSF to build this key addition to our country’s academic research fleet. https://t.co/nsNu2cgJRBCongress must take action and pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to stop the Trump administration’s inhumane policy of separating families. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/y6lNZ26im2Children belong with their families, NOT in detention centers or tent cities. Separating families at the border runs counter to our American and humanitarian values. This is not who we are as Americans. #FamiliesBelongTogetherInhumane and cruel - @realDonaldTrump administration’s treatment of innocent children who’ve been torn from their parents’ arms only succeeds in further traumatizing them. #FamiliesBelongTogether
https://t.co/CJAqupyGvLRipping a baby from its mother's breast is fundamentally evil. https://t.co/nll2UkJX6kThe only relationships @realDonaldTrump doesn't blow up are those with repressive regimes that line his pockets. https://t.co/jG4qHElk6HWhat’s worse than @realDonaldTrump breaking his promise to increase wages by $4,000?  Americans watching their wages shrink under #TrumpTax. https://t.co/k6fFCJAZyXWe must protect Medicaid access. Oregon’s rural communities depend on it. In Wallowa County’s 7,000 person population, nearly 2,000 rely on Medicaid, many gaining coverage thanks to Oregon’s #MedicaidExpansion. #OregonWayAfter my Wallowa County town hall last month, I met w/ Dr. Elizabeth Powers, a family physician at Winding Waters, about the impact of #MedicaidExpansion in Eastern OR &amp; how #CommunityHealthCenters &amp; preventative care have helped residents achieve their health goals. #OregonWay https://t.co/rYKG4S0oJoThis is astounding. @FERC commissioner told me that @SecretaryPerry’s proposal would raise energy rates between $32 BILLION and $65 BILLION total. That's $250 - $500 per family without a single added benefit. https://t.co/Nc3HYbanOHDon’t take it from me. Number crunchers confirm Trump’s campaign of sabotage is driving up your premiums. https://t.co/EM4kz3QSwVAmericans deserve a health care system that works for everybody – not just the healthy and wealthy. Trump and his Republican allies appear to believe otherwise.The Trump admin wants to roll back the clock: First, they tried to eliminate the Medicaid guarantee &amp; hurt seniors. Then they opened the door to #junkplans. Now, they want to let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions ranging from ovarian cancer to asthma.@realDonaldTrump After Republicans failed to pass #Trumpcare through Congress, they’ve been looking for any possible way to subvert the will of the American public, who stood up and spoke out against their regressive plans.When @realDonaldTrump and his Justice Department abandoned their duty to defend the law of the land, they put the health care of 130 million Americans with a pre-existing condition at risk. It’s another example of Trump’s health care agenda of discrimination. https://t.co/Xl5rYRY3AKGreat to see my friend JD and some of Oregon’s brightest ambulance stars with the 2018 @amerambassoc #StarsofLife! https://t.co/HScxqxriW6The World Cup is a celebration of culture, diversity and sport that brings people from all over the world together. No matter where you are from, no matter what your background is, this is a chance to support your home country and celebrate a game we all love. #United2026I’m excited to see the US, Canada and Mexico will host #WorldCup2026.

https://t.co/eUX4MiNkuYMy bipartisan #HempFarmingAct w/ @SenateMajLdr, @SenJeffMerkley and @RandPaul will help farmers unlock the full economic potential of industrial hemp, spurring economic growth and creating good-paying red, white, and blue jobs in rural communities across the country.I’m thrilled the bipartisan #HempFarmingAct passed the #SenateAg committee today. This marks a huge step toward allowing consumers to buy products made in America with hemp grown in America. #FarmBill18 https://t.co/6I6np0Dei3Thanks, @repblumenauer. Glad to have you as a partner on the Protecting American Votes &amp; Elections Act. Congress must act immediately to protect our elections. https://t.co/Fc6RDbGXBPAmericans with pre-existing conditions already struggle with periods of uninsurance. @realDonaldTrump wants to make it even harder for them to get the care they need and deserve. https://t.co/rITHX3zSvc.@realDonaldTrump wants to get rid of pre-existing condition protections - that puts over HALF of Americans under 65 at risk of being denied by an insurance company - 67 MILLION women and girls and 66 MILLION men and boys, according to @HHSgov. https://t.co/jiA0QYaXCy.@realDonaldTrump can’t just deny detainees their rights to legal counsel or to talk with their families. That’s why I am working with my colleagues in the Oregon delegation to fight back: https://t.co/u6lhOiqiNTLeaving the fate of America’s democracy up to hackable election machines is like leaving your front door open, unlocked and putting up a sign that says ‘out of town.’ It’s not a question of if bad guys get in, it’s just a question of when.For Americans to have confidence that their votes count, and that election results are free and fair, there absolutely have to be paper ballots and mandatory audits for each and every federal election.I’m proud @SenGillibrand, @SenMarkey, @SenJeffMerkley, @PattyMurray and @SenWarren are joining in introducing legislation to require state and local governments to take basic steps to secure elections from hackers, &amp; ensure every American’s vote counts.Russia’s attack on our democracy in 2016 was the last straw – Congress must act immediately to protect our democracy from cyberattacks. I’ve introduced the Protecting American Votes &amp; Elections Act to mandate paper ballots &amp; risk-limiting audits in all federal elections.Two years ago 49 lives were tragically taken at the #Pulse Nightclub shooting. Today and throughout #Pride month, we #HonorThemWithAction to end anti-LGBTQ violence, hatred and discrimination. https://t.co/a090vYEOZpGlad there’s action on my request to increase resources for the Rural Health Care program that’s so vital to rural Oregon. The time is now for the @FCC to pass this proposal. https://t.co/fa0aqeQJJzI fought this proposal before and I will continue to fight this corrupt scheme to bail out coal barons and swindle American families.Oregon has a 50% target for renewable power by 2040, and our utilities are working with the state to make it happen. That is what the future should look like.The Trump admin is reaching into Americans’ pocketbooks only to hand that hard-earned money to mismanaged utilities and uncompetitive coal companies, many of whom are Trump donors.The Trump administration’s commonsense-defying plan will raise utility rates for consumers from $30 billion to $65 billion - The average family will pay between $250 - $500 more per year for NOTHING, because this plan will not make the grid more secure or more reliable..@SecretaryPerry &amp; @realDonaldTrump are propping up their coal cronies at the expense of American families. Their absurd, unnecessary scheme to subsidize uncompetitive coal plants will raise your electric bill by $250 - $500 a year. https://t.co/UWS4LacGdfI’m standing with my Democratic colleagues as we work to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to put an END to the Trump administration’s policy of intentional cruelty to children and families. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMy own parents fled persecution in Nazi Germany. They were among the lucky ones who were allowed in as America turned away boatloads of Holocaust refugees. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/ZRe9iXdW1iThe Trump admin’s policy of tearing children out of their parents’ arms at the border is inhumane &amp; goes against American values. Punishing families for risking everything to escape the violence and horror of their home countries is NOT what built America. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/UvQpVHgZ6THunger never takes the summer off.

After multiple failed attempts to repeal the #ACA, this is the ultimate act of health care sabotage..@realDonaldTrump &amp; his admin have asked the courts to let insurance companies to deny care, charge more, and discriminate against the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions - everything from cancer to asthma..@USTreasury is stonewalling @SenateFinance’s request for financial details about Novartis’s business dealings with Michael Cohen. What exactly was Novartis trying to get for their $1.2 million payment? @maddow https://t.co/IR2kOWUFq9There are no justifications for this action by @realDonaldTrump that benefit the American people. There are several benefits for Trump personally. https://t.co/iupvAGliYpWhat better time to secure the #HempFarmingAct in the #FarmBill than #HempHistoryWeek https://t.co/HSWLpgkNKNMy bipartisan legislation with @SenateMajLdr would end America’s outdated anti-hemp laws so American consumers can buy products made with hemp grown in America. I’ll keep working with our bipartisan cosponsors - @SenJeffMerkley &amp; @RandPaul - to pass our bill into law.I’m proud my bipartisan #HempFarmingAct is included in the Senate #FarmBill. Hemp is a job-creating growth industry with far-reaching economic potential.

Our government has a humanitarian duty to the children &amp; families seeking asylum in the U.S. to end this policy immediately. #KeepFamiliesTogetherToday, I led 39 of our Democratic colleagues in demanding @realDonaldTrump and his admin stop further traumatizing children and end their new inhumane policy of separating innocent children from families who cross the Southwest border seeking asylum. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/c3H4ZSeJLWThanks, @nature_oregon! Our bipartisan #firefix is great news for Oregon and communities across the West. https://t.co/oUtyExrDPf@realDonaldTrump The only question is whether this was the price of Ivanka’s trademarks and the $500 million loan to an Indonesia Trump development..@realDonaldTrump &amp; congressional Republicans must reverse this decision before it’s too late. Trump is making America less safe by creating jobs in China and securing nothing for American workers in return. #BlockTheDealA loser deal for American security &amp; American workers. @realDonaldTrump &amp; his admin are giving ZTE &amp; China the green light to spy on Americans &amp; sell U.S. tech to North Korea &amp; Iran - as long as it pays a fine that’s only tiny fraction of its revenue. 
https://t.co/QQofTLIcOF@SenJeffMerkley @RandPaul Today, more than a quarter of the Senate – Democrats &amp; Republicans – have signed on to our #HempFarmingAct to end this brainless, anti-farmer, anti-American jobs policy. Momentum is growing, and I am not going to stop looking for every opportunity to make progress on this issue.Hemp is a HUGE opportunity for American farmers and red, white and blue jobs – which is why @LeaderMajLdr, @SenJeffMerkley, @RandPaul &amp; I intro’d the #HempFarmingAct in April – the latest version of legislation I’ve intro’d every Congress since 2012. #HempWeekHemp = The only Schedule I controlled substance you can sew into a tee shirt and wear through TSA. #HempWeekHemp = NOT a drug. Having one too many hemp granola bars might give you a stomach ache, but it won’t put you in the hospital. It defies common sense that our laws consider hemp to be as dangerous and addictive as meth. #HempWeekHemp products make up a $1 BILLION industry in the U.S. - Hemp growers in Canada and China are laughing their way to the bank, while hemp farmers at home have their hands tied with restrictions on growing this Schedule I controlled substance. #HempWeekProducts made with hemp are perfectly legal, but growing industrial hemp is a federal crime. It’s simple - If you can buy hemp products in a supermarket in America, farmers should be able to grow it in America. #HempWeek https://t.co/HSWLpgkNKNHappy #HempWeek! I’m headed to the Senate floor to speak in celebration of #HempHistoryWeek and to encourage my Senate colleagues to end the anti-farming restrictions on growing industrial hemp.Children are telling us they’re afraid to go to school because of gun violence. What could be more important for the Federal Commission on School Safety than addressing guns in schools? https://t.co/kQqlh2QhYDThis is a farce. https://t.co/3QPRGNZcqb.@realDonaldTrump is delivering jobs for China at expense of U.S. national security. Launching trade wars with our allies and days later capitulating to China. This Administration’s feckless China policy will be a disaster for American economic &amp; national security. #BlockTheDealThe charitable deduction is a lifeline—not a loophole. According to the nonpartisan @TaxPolicyCenter, #TrumpTax will cut the number of middle-income Americans claiming the charitable deduction by two-thirds. https://t.co/LzexCNGl0A https://t.co/o74m9CFqhm#TrumpTax set charitable groups up to fail. If this lack of giving continues, organizations will be forced to shutter their doors and leave the communities they serve with nowhere to turn. https://t.co/ApoSJ08P4ZI agree. @realDonaldTrump is a coward for pretending his policy of cruelty is required by law. https://t.co/ykIyDQorfvThe fact that Manafort feels free to engage in witness tampering, while being watched by federal authorities, raises questions about whether @realDonaldTrump promised Manafort he would never face justice. https://t.co/vWxvTPKrSCThis report eliminates any doubt that the #TrumpTax yanked Medicare closer to insolvency. Between reviving #junkplans, sending premiums skyrocketing &amp; doing serious damage to Medicare’s finances, Trump’s rap sheet on health care gets worse by the day. https://t.co/eWs7dlV6lrOregonians know all too well that you can’t eliminate fires, but our bipartisan #FireFix, coupled with smart use of air tankers and all wildfire fighting tools, can lessen wildfires’ catastrophic effects in Oregon &amp; across the West.In this morning’s @EnergyDems hearing, I asked Interim @forestservice Chief Christiansen how the Forest Service will ensure air tankers will be available to quickly and effectively fight fires this wildfire year. https://t.co/I5AHH4hGDF@forestservice My bipartisan #FireFix with @MikeCrapo is the law of the land. The @forestservice needs to get back in the woods and restart fire prevention projects to save lives.I heard Oregonians’ ongoing concerns last week at #2018townhalls about another significant wildfire year facing the West. Lives are at stake, and the @forestservice must do everything it can on fire prevention and suppression.No US ally should ever jail people for voicing political opinions. Bahrain must release Nabeel Rajab and others. 
https://t.co/CiSCHP6ngQThe Trump administration doesn’t have a solution to hold drug makers accountable. A bill I wrote, the SPIKE Act, would require drug companies to justify their exorbitant price hikes to the public. No more excuses while costs climb higher and higher.  https://t.co/KC5qwE5zqVSurprise, surprise - Even with drug rebates built in, high drug prices are clobbering taxpayers and consumers. 
https://t.co/GYbwN6P8Z1 https://t.co/bm1mWdCnr4In Medicare’s prescription drug program, Americans paid more and got less. The people happiest about it sit in Big Pharma board rooms.  
https://t.co/GYbwN6P8Z1 https://t.co/nNai6P5VayIn this memo, @realDonaldTrump blows past the rule of law and says he is the state. https://t.co/bCx5JL6uVAProud to call Commissioner Hall a long-time friend. A true public servant for Lincoln County and role model for all. https://t.co/KWbJIsvfvaWe must keep working to ensure our country does not slip back to the dark days when pure prejudice forced LGBTQ Americans to be afraid. Congress must act to protect LGBTQ rights - discrimination for any reason remains discrimination. #OpenToAllDiscriminating against anybody because of how they look, who they love or who they are has no place in our country. #OpenToAll #MasterpieceCakes
https://t.co/jkncszQkEPTough draw for @timbersfc today but I still enjoyed the best fans in MLS and getting to hang out with @TimberJoey. #rctid https://t.co/FS8mtsFsNfIt’s past time for Congress to create real solutions and stop normalizing gun violence. #EnoughIt was insightful listening to @march4portland leaders this afternoon share their ideas for addressing gun violence in our communities and schools. Political change to stop this epidemic must come from the grassroots. #EnoughisEnough #NeverAgain https://t.co/AnvRiDItl0Big thanks to Prineville Mayor Betty Roppe for moderating yesterday’s Crook County #2018townhall, for your long-time friendship and for all you do to make Prineville a wonderful place. https://t.co/OEzZMTq7c0A wonderful #OregonWay conversation at today’s Crook County #2018townhall in Prineville about renewal of Secure Rural Schools, new tools to fight wildfires smarter, building the rural economy and more. https://t.co/74axG8N8iYThank you to @RandPaul, @SenCoryGardner and @SenMarkey for joining my call to DHS to release this information, and @DHSgov for beginning to make these threats public. 
https://t.co/EYd5FMx7ilThe cavalier attitude toward our national security appears to be coming from the top down. It is high time for the @FCC and the Trump admin to act immediately to protect American national security. https://t.co/S60xvqGFd0.@DHSgov told me there may be a rogue cellphone spying device near the White House, and yet reports say the president doesn’t even use a secure phone to protect his calls. 
https://t.co/ljtcd5djWZProud to #WearOrange today in solidarity with Americans of all ages and backgrounds working every day to reduce our country’s epidemic of gun violence. Congress must step up &amp; take common-sense steps toward curbing gun violence in America. https://t.co/47LyJ9Ud3zI called on the @Energy Department last fall to abandon these schemes to prop up the coal industry at the expense of American families. It was a corrupt idea then, and it’s a corrupt idea now. https://t.co/JILxvhDzWdIt's bad enough gas prices have already risen under the Trump administration, but now @SecretaryPerry is planning to blow up energy markets &amp; raise utility rates to pad the wallets of his coal executive friends. https://t.co/wlUkt9hfAJHeard today at @STCHealth in Bend from providers of rural health care in Oregon — and from @OHSUNews via teleconference — about the importance of reliable broadband to telemedicine that’s key to quality healthcare throughout our state. https://t.co/ZjNARw9Q5hInstead of leading our allies to confront China's unfair trade and investment practices,  @realDonaldTrump has united our allies to confront the United States.  https://t.co/xYqISqvu8iGreat to meet yesterday in Bend with so many of the innovative leaders who are building the High Desert into a high-tech center that’s renowned nationally and globally. https://t.co/PX3aPAsDlhEnjoyed today’s #2018townhall in Paisley &amp; hearing from Lake County students &amp; adults about common-sense solutions that can generate rural jobs, reduce gun violence, restore #NetNeutrality and more. https://t.co/lLIPi8VJeYTo date, the Trump admin appears to be pursuing a trade policy that creates economic chaos and uncertainty rather than jobs for hard working Americans.The U.S. needs to take tough, immediate action to fight back against China’s predatory policies, and bring back American steel and aluminum jobs. But these tariffs, on the very allies we need to pressure China, make no sense.The road to @OregonSB winning the #WCWS and bringing the title home to Eugene begins this morning. #GoDucksLooking forward very much to today’s Lake County #2018townhall in Paisley and tomorrow’s Crook County #2018townhall in Prineville. Details of both open-to-all town halls are here: 
https://t.co/3cGcudtkiaThanks to the health clinic staff at North Eugene High School for all the great work you do every day for students and for taking the time to educate me today. https://t.co/LRVdDXwjQpThanks to the #TrumpTax, major corporations have announced $450 BILLION in stock buybacks – schemes that enrich CEOs and foreign shareholders and leave workers in the lurch.As we head into the warm summer months, I’m hearing from Oregonians concerned about the upcoming fire season. I’ve urged the @forestservice chief &amp; will continue to press the agency to make sure air tankers are available when &amp; where they are needed to fight fires this year.The Trump administration’s inhumane new policy of separating immigrant families as a way to deter people from coming to the United States undermines our values as Americans. This policy of cruelty must end. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/72fAJznOooHeard fresh ideas today from the impressive students at North Eugene HS to solve long-time stalemates over gun violence, #DACA, #NetNeutrality, graduation rates &amp; more. #ListeningToTheFuture https://t.co/LxyODcxTOGI’ve been pushing the @FCC for more than a year to force phone companies to secure their networks. Foreign surveillance companies like this one openly advertise powerful spying tech, which they sell to governments around the world https://t.co/J1hvvIccNF.@AjitPaiFCC seems to be more interested in protecting his friends at the wireless carriers than protecting Americans.The @FCC can &amp; should conduct an independent assessment of the security of U.S. phone networks, identity which networks are lagging behind, &amp; then force those companies to up their security.If more consumers knew how easily bad guys can track or hack their mobile phones, they’d demand the @FCC &amp; wireless companies do something. 
https://t.co/jFrBYs34qmBig thanks to the @RedCrossCasc responders from Oregon and SW Washington going to help the people of Hawaii affected by the Kilauea volcano. https://t.co/B8YfE6961SDon’t forget - While @realDonaldTrump praised Vladmir Putin, Russia plotted with the OPEC oil cartel to drive up oil prices and gouge Americans at the pump.  https://t.co/MWXF6n8waRI can’t see any rhyme or reason to the Trump admin’s erratic policy shifts.A week ago @stevenmnuchin1 announced that the tariffs were off. Over the weekend, the Trump admin went ahead with its plan to save Chinese jobs at ZTE - a company violating Iran &amp; North Korean sanctions.Another day, another trade announcement. But it still doesn’t look like @realDonaldTrump and his admin really intend to crack down on China.After #2018TownHalls and #MemorialDay services in Eastern and Southern Oregon, I’m headed to the Multnomah County Courthouse for jury duty this morning. Jury duty is the heart of our justice system.  #RonReport https://t.co/2UOB4OU47OOn this #MemorialDay and every day  @Lines_for_Life supports veterans with their Military Help Line. #ORVets https://t.co/lPk4wtGNwISo honored to be at Eagle Point National Cemetery in Southern Oregon this afternoon on #MemorialDay to pay tribute to the brave lives lost while making the ultimate sacrifice for our country. https://t.co/mn1bLmjBFxStarted the morning in Central Point at the Oregon Fallen War Heroes Memorial this #MemorialDay to honor the brave Americans who made the greatest sacrifice for our country and freedoms. https://t.co/MR0gX08A1COn this #MemorialDayWeekend, it was great visiting with Oregon veterans in The Dalles at the Oregon Veterans Home - and hearing how I can continue to advocate for and support veterans and seniors. #ORVets https://t.co/5j7gd0YZ1eOregonians shouldn’t have to drain their wallets to fill up their tanks.I stopped by a Trump gas pump in Eastern Oregon where gas prices are skyrocketing. @realDonaldTrump’s reckless decision to break our deal with Iran has only added to the spike in pump prices and created massive uncertainty in oil markets. #RonReport https://t.co/pDcEATrYS0Huge thanks, Wallowa County for a strong turnout this #MemorialDayWeekend in Joseph for today’s #2018townhall. Great #OregonWay conversation about issues affecting Eastern OR &amp; our country including health care access, drug prices, LGBTQ rights, #publiclands &amp; affordable housing. https://t.co/7Bq7ttUZHlAs Oregonians prepare to mark today’s anniversary of the horrific MAX attack in Portland, it's unfortunate that the Senate-passed resolution honoring the heroes of that day remains blocked by Republican leadership in the House.
https://t.co/R9DFN8QbnPBy repealing #NetNeutrality, what @AjitPaiFCC really wants is a wish list for the deep pockets of the information aristocracy and a path to digital serfdom. 
https://t.co/7JPnfzXgOOMy thoughts are with the victims of today’s horrific hit-and-run in downtown Portland. Big thanks to the first responders who came to the scene.Moved by today’s visit to the beautiful memorial at Portland’s Hollywood Transit Center honoring the heroes who stood up bravely to domestic terrorism in last May’s horrific MAX attack. https://t.co/y5q6iKZ28NWith strong #NetNeutrality allies like @RepBonamici , @Jennifer_for_OR, @SMeieran and @MultCoLib_Dir, people power can prevail in the U. S. House on net neutrality just as it did in the U.S. Senate. https://t.co/6xiWQDQJM9Heard from Oregonians today in Portland at the @MultCoLib branch in Hillsdale about the urgent need to restore #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/EaHywzh4AJAmerican workers remain hostage to China's rampant unfair trade practices while the Trump Administration lets ZTE off scot-free for cheating on Iran and North Korea sanctions.  What happened to America First? 
https://t.co/saGS94aQe1China has done less than nothing for us on trade. Why is this administration working so quickly to save jobs at a Chinese tech company?
https://t.co/LbCDxetbF5Glad that Donald Trump has finally recognized what history &amp; common sense could have told him months ago before he launched this misguided BPA privatization scheme that would’ve hurt NW ratepayers: https://t.co/H8HlRgP2WLAs I have seen and heard firsthand from meeting #DACA students across Oregon, DREAMers like Paola Amaral of @Nyssa_Bulldogs work hard and make their communities better places:  https://t.co/eeRVlqh9irTrump needs to stop lobbying for payoffs to Big Oil executives and focus on helping regular Americans – starting by urging the OPEC oil cartel to stop inflating gas prices..@realdonaldtrump’s reckless decision to break our deal with Iran has only added to the spike in oil prices, and created massive uncertainty in oil markets that translates to more pain at the pump for drivers.Any tax benefit working families might have seen from Trump’s law will be wiped clean by the rise in gas prices.7 of the largest Big Oil companies announced $13 billion in stock buybacks after Trump signed his #TrumpTax bill into law. These schemes fatten the wallets of wealthy CEOs &amp; shareholders worldwide - NOT working Americans.🚨 Since @realDonaldTrump took the wheel, he’s driven gas prices in one direction – straight up. Gas prices have risen more than 25% since Trump took office, hitting an average of nearly $3 a gallon nationwide.It’s hard to imagine a more important duty at the #FAA than ensuring passenger safety. I’m demanding answers from the FAA about its delay in addressing safety concerns ahead of the fatal @SouthwestAir flight. https://t.co/AACd0U4ph0I wrote to @FBI Director Wray: “The FBI is struggling with basic arithmetic – clearly it should not be in the business of dictating the design of advanced cryptographic algorithms.” https://t.co/tgPcc2Qb0wThe @FBI said it couldn’t break into 7800 encrypted phones. The real number is actually below 1/6th of that - or even less..@realDonaldTrump and his administration don’t want to let your doctor tell you the truth about your health care options. 
https://t.co/cxNdtZ9OhkThe U.S. spent $3.5 TRILLION on health care last year. With that kind of $ going into health care in this country, it must be possible to guarantee rural Americans aren’t on the outside looking in. https://t.co/4Q3McDSFZQ@realDonaldTrump Since 2010, 83 rural hospitals have closed services, and hundreds more are in dire conditions. We must prevent rural America from turning into that sacrifice zone where people can’t get the care they need.@realDonaldTrump Rural areas feel like their local hospitals are already teetering on the brink of closing their doors. If they lose their local hospital, the emergency department goes with it.Rural communities feel like there’s a wrecking ball headed their way because the @realDonaldTrump, his admin &amp; Congressional Republicans have spent the last 15 months desperately trying to make huge cuts to Medicaid - a lifeline for rural hospitals and patients.When I hold open-to-all town hall meetings in every rural Oregon county, I meet with many leaders from the rural health care community and Oregonians who depend on quality care.The #TrumpTax has Harley-Davidson shareholders riding all the way to the bank – at the expense of its workers and their communities. https://t.co/GBVtBTndYnFind the full list of my @SenateFinance colleagues’ bills here: https://t.co/HDQxLvpC56I’m proud to announce with my @SenateFinance colleagues 22 bipartisan Medicare, Medicaid and Human Services bills that take a significant step forward in finding a lasting fix.Congress must take real and lasting action to confront the growing opioid epidemic that’s devastated far too many people and their loved ones in Oregon and across the country.@realDonaldTrump This is an attack on @PPFA &amp; an attack on vital sources of care for women. Women could lose access to the doctors they trust &amp; to life-saving services like cancer screenings, routine physicals, as well as birth control &amp; prenatal care.@realDonaldTrump Republicans in Congress used to talk about “patient-centered care.” What they really put into action is politics-centered care.Limiting health care choices for women is wrong. @realDonaldTrump’s administration is putting itself right in the middle of women and their doctors, denying access to critical information millions of women rely on from the physicians and providers they trust. https://t.co/QCtO5fJiwOWhen so many Oregonians can’t afford a roof over their heads, our entire community suffers. With rent &amp; housing costs soaring in OR, this much-needed public housing funding will help ensure the availability of this basic necessity all Oregonians deserve. https://t.co/IX1rEBezZY@realDonaldTrump The bottom line - A woman’s ability to access the health care she deserves and make informed decisions about her body should be an unimpeachable right. We must fight against this attack on women’s health care..@realDonaldTrump wants to put the government in charge of what conversations doctors can have with their patients and which health care services women can receive - That’s as ‘Big Brother’ as it gets.@SenateFinance Stock buyback schemes boost CEO pay by inflating stock prices – but Big Oil execs on this stock buyback spree are already out-earning their average employees by up to 935 times.@SenateFinance Since Trump signed his tax law, 7 of the biggest oil companies have announced stock buybacks totaling $13 BILLION. https://t.co/MmF8TOeIGE@SenateFinance Big Oil CEOs are funneling their #TrumpTax cuts into BILLIONS of dollars into stock buybacks. Oil execs and foreign shareholders are raking in these big benefits while working families watch prices at the pump skyrocket.@SenateFinance By giving corporations a permanent tax cut, the #TrumpTax is giving Big Oil major tax windfalls year after year. Over the next decade, 4 of the biggest oil companies are estimated to rake in nearly $15 BILLION in tax benefits..@SenateFinance staff analyzed Big Oil earnings calls and financial documents that exposed how #TrumpTax set up Big Oil to rake in billions and billions of dollars in tax benefits over the next decade. https://t.co/MmF8TOeIGE@USDOL Diversity of skills &amp; backgrounds is what makes our country a powerhouse of innovation. This draft legislation is an important first step toward helping businesses harness the immense brainpower, talent and economic potential the American workforce has to offer.@USDOL My draft ELEVATE Act will help workers access on-the-job training and support services like child care &amp; transportation, allowing more workers to succeed and stay on the job, helping their families, their employers &amp; their communities thrive. https://t.co/twvvReR8HrAccording to @USDOL, there’s a job opening for every American who needs work. The reality is that folks who are out of work want a job. But more needs to be done to connect Americans to good-paying jobs &amp; help everyone climb the economic ladder.Unemployment is at a post-recession low, but there’s still a huge gap between current job openings &amp; workers needing good jobs. I’m announcing a proposal to fund employment programs to narrow the workforce gap and help more Americans find work &amp; support. https://t.co/342fnZurAIIt's high time for the government to drop this misguided effort, which will only make Americans less safe from criminals, hackers and predators. 
https://t.co/Q1PEq0J2UwPoliticians have been pushing for years to put government backdoors in Americans' phones and computers, apparently, based on wildly inflated statistics.What do Americans get in return for @realDonaldTrump saving Chinese jobs at ZTE? https://t.co/AxIgoJkWQ3After months of fruitless trade negotiations, it’s stunning to see how rapidly the Trump administration sprang into action to save these jobs at ZTE, a Chinese firm that schemed to use shell companies to violate our sanctions on Iran &amp; North Korea. https://t.co/uBT2wbd42BWhile the #TrumpTax is filling the pockets of Big Oil execs, Oregonians are facing some of the country’s highest gas prices. Hardworking families are forced to pinch pennies. https://t.co/AncO7KOzuyAmericans are seeing gas prices skyrocket under the #TrumpTax. On top of that, @realDonaldTrump's decision to withdraw from the #IranNuclearDeal has American families paying even more at the pump: https://t.co/o5rtW2QqkJNEW @SenateFinance report finds as gas prices soar for working families, the #TrumpTax is handing BILLIONS to Big Oil. https://t.co/rfPaXDrqiI https://t.co/8qoQwWvZiUWhen I see the students and young people who organized the March for Our Lives in our nation’s capital, in Oregon and across the country, I see the spirit of those Thurston youngsters violently stolen from their families and loved ones. https://t.co/4Kw0SZsxuECongress must push back against special interests that have blocked every reasonable effort to protect our children and communities from gun violence. Congress must finally honor the lives lost by passing commonsense gun laws.Today I’m remembering the shooting at Thurston High School in Springfield, 20 years ago. The horrific epidemic of gun violence in our schools rips away the lives of children and teachers, forever wounding the body and spirit of entire communities which never truly heal.That said, Dana Baiocco’s nomination is one more in a pattern. When a consumer protection job comes open, the Trump administration fills it with a corporate swamp creature who has actively opposed the protection of consumers. I’m voting NO on her nomination tonight..@USCPSC is consumer protection 101. For example: making sure the toys toddlers put in their mouths aren’t covered in poison. Somehow the Trump administration found a way, with this nominee, to put itself on the wrong side of the poisoning children “debate.”Dana Baiocco defended a company that sold dangerous children’s toys containing lead paint. Now she’s the Trump administration’s nominee to regulate … wait for it … *THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN’S TOYS* as a @USCPSC commissioner. https://t.co/b7lR6FFGB5Cosign. https://t.co/CxWPQMhSBD@realDonaldTrump It’s time for Congress to do some real bipartisan oversight. We need to pin down any connection between these conflicts and Trump going soft on China.@realDonaldTrump Or is his foreign policy so feckless that he has to buy off China with American jobs in exchange for help with N. Korea? https://t.co/01DnLEdJYs@realDonaldTrump A new Trump Organization project in Indonesia is waiting on a $500 million loan from the Chinese government. https://t.co/Zptfrr1nCn@realDonaldTrump The Chinese government likely pays @realDonaldTrump millions to rent offices in Trump Tower, according to Forbes. https://t.co/WJ0jxstsl0@realDonaldTrump The Bank of China owns the loan that financed a New York skyscraper the Trump Organization has a big stake in. 
https://t.co/tbxl4XbXR9@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump have been asking the Chinese government for trademarks, so they can make money in the Chinese market. https://t.co/0StH5BqCitWhen @realDonaldTrump decides to go easy on China, you have to ask who he’s working for. It’s worth remembering he has a lot of business at stake with China.Despite massive tax cuts for Big Oil companies, Americans are paying hundreds more at the pump. https://t.co/JPUBRfv7mdUntil China actually agrees to action helping American workers and there’s evidence of follow through, I’ll keep pushing for the fundamental reforms creating more high-skill, high-wage jobs for American workers.After all the tough-guy rhetoric, the Trump admin is getting rolled on trade with China. Last year, this admin thought it had a meaningful deal with China, but it delivered little more than broken promises. @realDonaldTrump, it’s not mission accomplished.Glad to partner with @MartinHeinrich, @maziehirono, @SenBooker @senrobportman &amp; @SenAlexander to pass the bipartisan #KidstoParks Day Senate resolution to encourage kids to get outdoors &amp; learn to lead healthy, active lives from a young age! #KidstoParks https://t.co/eUEe02KyMKToday is #KidstoParks Day! #FindYourPark and enjoy free events with @ORStateParks and @NatParkTrust. Here’s where to find opportunities in Oregon to #escapetheindoors: https://t.co/kmRK2z4Tyn https://t.co/uXhN4ga6PmThe fight isn't over to protect food assistance for the 1 in 8 Americans who relies on SNAP. I remain committed to protecting this essential food assistance program that millions of Americans are counting on &amp; will do all I can to ensure it is available for those who need it.The #GOPFarmBill would have made it harder for families to access SNAP benefits by implementing burdensome paperwork requirements, while states would be left footing the bill to create new standards to evaluate SNAP participants.Good news for children &amp; families in Oregon &amp; across the country: the #GOPFarmBill failed today in the House. This bill threatened to take vital food assistance away from millions of Americans who are working hard just to get by.Trump seems to think Big Pharma will magically lower their prices for American consumers if other countries pay more. If Trump’s tax law is any indication, those profits are going right back to Pharma’s worldwide shareholders while U.S. families keep paying more and more. https://t.co/hvSIGTWiC1The Trump administration wants to gut funding for lifesaving health care services that millions of women rely on. Telling women what kind of care and information they can and can’t receive is Trump’s agenda of health care discrimination on full display. https://t.co/TUCS5fC6BOI am heartbroken and angry to hear of lives lost at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. No amount of thoughts and prayers will ever be enough. We must take common-sense steps NOW to stop this senseless gun violence.If the @FCC refuses to act after this revelation then future crimes against Americans will be on the commissioners' heads.
https://t.co/INQxQUjVanA hacker could have used this site to know when you were in your house so they would know when to rob it.  A predator could have tracked your child’s cell phone to know when they were alone.Wireless carriers and LocationSmart appear to have allowed nearly any hacker with a basic knowledge of websites to track the location of any American with a cell phone. They value profits over privacy.This leak, only days after the lax security at Securus was exposed, shows how little companies throughout the wireless ecosystem value Americans’ security. https://t.co/CaxtI7MUl4This bill jeopardizes SNAP benefits for millions of children through unfair work requirements that do nothing to help families. #HandsOffSNAPTomorrow the House votes on a #FarmBill the @HouseGOP has turned into a partisan gambling chip with children standing to lose the most. 
https://t.co/sjp1iuMHQHAll children deserve to grow up in a safe and loving home. Now it’s time for states to take advantage of the opportunities the #FamilyFirstAct provides to improve the lives of children and families. #FosterCareMonthI’m proud Congress passed my #FamilyFirstAct with @senorrinhatch to provide real help to families in the midst of our country’s opioid epidemic. I’ll never stop working to bring America’s foster care systems up to the standards our children deserve. 
https://t.co/rzevvdp9ScMay is #NationalFosterCareMonth – I’m celebrating the families and compassionate people who open their hearts and homes to #FosterYouth. #FosterCareMonth https://t.co/ikZIwXRqTjThere is much more that the full Senate and the public should know about Haspel’s background, and I am convinced that, if they did, her nomination would be rejected.In our democracy, confirmations are not supposed to take place in secret. Nominees do not get to decide what is and isn’t known about them. With Haspel’s nomination, these principles have been thrown out the window.Gina Haspel and the @CIA have conducted an unprecedented and entirely self-serving cover-up, and the U.S. Senate has been a willing partner. I’m voting NO on Haspel’s confirmation to be CIA director..@CIA nominee Gina Haspel is exercising unprecedented power to personally censor any facts that might get in the way of her confirmation. I’m speaking out on the Senate floor against the CIA’s A – Z cover-up: https://t.co/N0fCE9KZgrAnyone who voted AGAINST this #NetNeutrality resolution voted FOR Big Cable and AGAINST the American public. They voted in favor of higher prices for streaming services like Netflix &amp; Hulu, squeezing every last dollar they can out of consumers, while Big Cable cashes in.I was the first to introduce #NetNeutrality legislation in the Senate, over a decade ago, and I’m committed to fighting for telecommunications policies rooted in openness, non-discrimination, and freedom online.Voting to protect #NetNeutrality is the biggest win for the Internet since beating PIPA SOPA. I’ve spent my career fighting for a free and open internet, because I believe that EVERYONE should have fair &amp; equal access to information. #RonReport https://t.co/V7Q0SYyHIjThe temporary tax breaks for craft beverage job creators will not be repealed by Democrats. Republicans are playing politics with a provision they chose to write in disappearing ink.My bill has overwhelming support in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle. It would make reductions in excise tax burdens for the beverage industry last.
https://t.co/mbewavpFS3The bitter truth – #TrumpTax abandoned my bipartisan bill that gave permanent tax breaks to distillers, brewers and vintners – making it more difficult for #smallbiz to make new hires and make new investments they need to thrive.The American people just scored a BIG victory in the fight to protect real #NetNeutrality and stop Big Cable. Now it’s time for the House to listen to the American people and pass this resolution to #SaveNetNeutrality.This is beyond absurd. It’s vital that Bolton and @realDonaldTrump retain a dedicated cyber advisor to ensure that our nation, critical infrastructure, and economy are protected from the ever-growing cyber-attacks on the U.S. 
https://t.co/SOSp2h7JL0Since I became the first Senator to introduce net neutrality legislation more than a decade ago, I’ve fought for open, free &amp; transparent telecommunications policies. The Senate must do the right thing to protect consumers &amp; #smallbiz by voting to save #NetNeutralityOregonians know what’s at stake in this fight. Ending #NetNeutrality = snail’s pace internet, rural business will have a harder time getting off the ground &amp; rural health care providers miss out on lifesaving technological marvels.If Senate Republicans let the Trump admin to get away with ending #NetNeutrality, Americans will be charged more for their Netflix &amp; Hulu subscriptions and music services. The Trump FCC is handing Big Cable more money and power.This Senate vote on #NetNeutrality will have the biggest direct impact on Americans’ wallets than any other vote in 2018. @realDonaldTrump and @AjitpaiFCC want to end our free and open internet. https://t.co/ydO0ZQAcUaWatch LIVE as I head to the Senate floor to share why today’s vote on #NetNeutrality is so important: https://t.co/Pc9c1TRA37I’ve asked again &amp; again for justification for Haspel’s self-serving classification decisions.  Every response I’ve received classified/unclassified has convinced me more that her decisions have nothing to do with protecting sources &amp; methods - only with protecting her own image.Gina Haspel and the @CIA have committed one of the most blatant abuses of power in recent history, aided and abetted by a total failure of Congressional oversight. https://t.co/vs9bQQReoeLooking forward to joining @IndivisibleTeam tonight. Tune in! https://t.co/TUNr0xwaiTCongratulations to @OHSUNews on earning this incredible @NIH grant that puts Oregon front &amp; center for future research of serious diseases. https://t.co/PagZnGhPVXMy #RecreationNotRedTape Act with @NatResources Chairman Bishop breaks down barriers and helps Americans #GetOutdoors and enjoy our country’s #publiclands. Bipartisan solutions like ours will help keep our outdoor recreation economy alive and thriving. https://t.co/GC4EC1bRTY.@realDonaldTrump’s comments about ZTE sound an alarm bell for counterintelligence, cyber security, &amp; red, white and blue jobs. His own top counterintelligence official said ZTE threatens U.S. national security. In my view, giving sanctions relief to ZTE is a big mistake. https://t.co/4hnaOP4dKoThrilled to see Mustafa Abed getting such deserved attention and care from @TimbersFC. Great job Timbers putting a smile on the face of this courageous young man. #RCTID https://t.co/dzQX9Za6yHAs I told @PoMoMagazine in its latest edition, the callous Trump approach on hunger ”really would be the Hunger Games on steroids.” #OAM18 https://t.co/91z7l0z1vkPrograms including @oregonfoodbank and @_MealsOnWheels are lifelines for seniors. We must ensure that these programs are funded and accessible. #OAM18 https://t.co/WwSkQzY7GPI’m committed to protecting earned benefits for seniors including #Medicare and Social Security, fighting against insurance scams, &amp; ensuring seniors have voting access. #OlderAmericansMonth #OAM18Advocating for seniors has been a priority of mine since I founded the Portland chapter of the Gray Panthers in 1974. In my book, every month should be #OlderAmericansMonth. #OAM18 https://t.co/9wu7d8YpuKThe American people and the Senate deserve the complete truth about @CIA nominee Gina Haspel. Every senator must be able to read the Durham Report on the destruction of torture videotapes before voting. #UnlockDurhamReport🚨 The Senate vote to save #NetNeutrality and protect a free &amp; open Internet will be held Wednesday, May 16. 

This fight isn’t over - It’s time to stop Big Cable. 

Make your voices heard and stay loud!Huge congrats to @OregonSB for earning the No. 1 overall seed in the @NCAAsoftball championship and to @BeaverSoftball for earning a tournament bid. #GoDucks #GoBeavsWhy is @realDonaldTrump personally protecting a Chinese tech company guilty of evading US sanctions on Iran?  Maybe this: https://t.co/baCB25CigrUnilateral concessions before an upcoming trade negotiation. This may be the art of the deal for China but it's a big loser for American workers, companies, and national security.Reports about Michael Cohen’s pay-to-play scheme with Novartis looks more like a corporate shakedown than an honest business arrangement. https://t.co/02Rj8oYsJoI’m opening an inquiry into prescription drug company @Novartis about their deals with @realDonaldTrump’s attorney and go-to money man Michael Cohen: https://t.co/94wIcDy8gfNo one should have to choose between putting food on the table &amp; accessing lifesaving treatment for an illness. While the Trump administration refuses to take real action, I’m ready to work on a bipartisan basis to make good on Trump’s promise to lower drug prices.Drug companies continue to funnel their massive tax windfall from Trump’s tax law into tens of billions of dollars in stock buybacks for their wealthy shareholders, including those overseas, instead of lowering drug prices for families here at home.The execs in pharmaceutical board rooms across the country are breathing a sigh of relief today - @realDonaldTrump still isn’t delivering on his promise to make prescription drugs more affordable..@realDonaldTrump's big drug speech sent pharmaceutical stocks through the roof - that's an awfully bad sign for Americans with costly prescriptions. https://t.co/r4QoiH9F60On a taxpayer-funded trip, @EPAScottPruitt dined with a notorious accused child molester, and the documents show they tried to hide it. The moral bankruptcy on display is appalling. Pruitt is unfit for public service. https://t.co/3dCJLW2DgIEnjoyed meeting @portland_state student and @indiancommittee intern Brook Thompson. As a Gates Millennium Scholar and American Indian Student of the Year, she is an example of Oregon excellence. I look forward to watching her better her Yurok tribal community. https://t.co/jRx7CtRLyvWhile @realDonaldTrump continues to give Big Pharma a “get out of jail free” card, Democrats are ready to act to lower drug prices &amp; make health care more affordable for all Americans. https://t.co/26gHdXX5yUThis one-sided #TrumpTax law has successfully helped wealthy CEOs achieve record-breaking buybacks - while companies lay off thousands of hardworking Americans and ship red, white and blue jobs overseas. https://t.co/mFcLripG2HAll the while CEO pay has reached a new $12-million-dollar high. https://t.co/8N1SjgRy2CFor months we’ve watched the #GOPTaxScam help the rich get richer as working Americans have watched Trump fail to deliver their $4,000 wage increases.Since the #GOPTaxScam’s passage, CEOs have announced $400 BILLION + in stock buybacks, fattening their own compensation. The middle class continues to hear empty promises from @GOP that #TrumpTax will promote infrastructure investment + job &amp; wage growth.
https://t.co/2sfy5AXlUZBig congrats to the Oregon Teacher of the Year award winners! @ORDeptED and Oregon’s kids are lucky to have such amazing teachers and mentors. #TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/mGoFjnZlxPHappy #TeacherAppreciationWeek to all my friends and super teachers who go to work every day to help Oregon students succeed in school. #ThankATeacher this week. https://t.co/xEeiYZwJHBIt was fantastic meeting rock climbers Margo Hayes and @TommyCaldwell1 at @REI last night for #ClimbTheHill. These top climbers are moving mountains when it comes to protecting our #PublicLands and promoting outdoor recreation. #GetOutside https://t.co/Y7vRb0RuwuAmerican families want to see real action when it comes to lowering drug prices. I’m speaking out with @SenateDems against America’s broken drug pricing system. https://t.co/1tkXvpBqvaThere’s no evidence that @realDonaldTrump’s announcement tomorrow will lead to one single drug price decrease by @SecAzar’s former colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry.At today’s fire briefing at @USDA, I pressed @SecretarySonny, @SecretaryZinke &amp; @forestservice to make sure air tankers are available when the blazes start. https://t.co/0JZeqOqorCOregonians in rural parts of our state told me last week they’re concerned there won’t be enough air tankers to stop the spread of fires this summer.After @CIA nominee Gina Haspel’s Intel hearing testimony, the American people are left wondering who is telling the truth about the destruction of torture videotapes - Haspel or Rodriguez. @Maddow: https://t.co/c7OoN98Ap0The grassroots efforts of athletes, climbers and outdoor recreation enthusiasts are helping to turn this bill into a reality. #RecreationNotRedTape is about knocking down barriers to growing the outdoor recreation economy nationwide.At the start of the summer recreation season, there’s real momentum behind the bipartisan #RecreationNotRedTape Act. Last month, the House @NatResources committee unanimously passed our legislation. #ClimbTheHillIt was great joining @SenJoniErnst, a champion for outdoor recreation &amp; sponsor of my #RecreationNotRedTape bill, at #ClimbTheHill with @OIA, @accessfund &amp; @americanalpine. #GetOutdoors https://t.co/On8fV7iEtsI’m proud to have worked with @MikeCrapo &amp; others to pass our bipartisan #FireFix to extinguish fire borrowing &amp; give the @forestservice the stable funding it needs to get back into the woods &amp; restart the fire prevention work that can save lives.Thank you to @nature_wonks &amp; the more than 260 diverse groups of conservationists, foresters, recreationists &amp; scientists who helped end the backwards cycle of fire borrowing and contributed to making our bipartisan fire fix the law of the land. #FireFixed https://t.co/vV4Uiv7tLbThe Internet doesn’t belong to Big Cable, @AjitPaiFCC and @realDonaldTrump, it belongs to the American people. Make your voices heard to support our resolution that ensures real #NetNeutrality! https://t.co/dFpcIH21t8So far the American people have only been given information designed to get @CIA director nominee Gina Haspel confirmed. It’s selective declassification – and the American people deserve to know who Haspel is and her history. https://t.co/COF63VpepxI spoke on the Senate floor about how today's @senjudiciary hearing for Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals nominee Ryan Bounds “throws in the dustbin” a century-old bipartisan practice for judicial nominations:
https://t.co/WLnCjYkOMs🚨 Today @SenateDems are officially filing the petition to #SaveNetNeutrality and ensure Americans have a free and open Internet. Speak out! #OneMoreVote https://t.co/ZivKtRpRvgThere is still an urgent need for more low-income housing options. Oregon is stronger and more prosperous when everyone has a safe place to call home. #OurHomesOurVoicesIn March, Congress expanded the low-income housing tax credit, so more Oregonians will now be able to have a roof over their heads. This legislation is expected to create 35,000 new affordable housing units and 40,000 jobs across the U.S.No one should have to decide between paying rent or putting food on the table. That’s unacceptable. #CutsHurt #OurHomesOurVoicesRyan Bounds misled the independent committee that considers potential nominees in Oregon by withholding inflammatory writings revealing disturbing views on sexual assault and the treatment of vulnerable people. https://t.co/Dti4i5c8fY.@senjudiciary is throwing out a century of bipartisan tradition by holding a hearing on Ryan Bounds’ Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals nomination. It’s shameful that Republicans are changing the rules to stack the courts. https://t.co/AIFUou4yxg#Trumpcare = fewer choices, no competition, high prices, worse health care. It’s a far cry from @realDonaldTrump’s promises of “health care for everybody” and “lower costs.” https://t.co/L51AUJzEydNo #junkplans cover pre-existing conditions. None pay for maternity care. Less than 3 in 10 junk plans pay for prescription drugs. https://t.co/e2PwNd8twTBottom line: Premiums are going up because the Trump Administration is undermining health care markets to settle a political score and please special interests. They’re creating #Trumpcare with each executive action.Americans are beginning to see the full effects of congressional Republicans' campaign of health care sabotage as more insurance companies announce big premium increases for open enrollment this fall.I’m joining @SenSchumer &amp; @PattyMurray  to expose @realDonaldTrump and his Republican allies in Congress’ vindictive crusade on families’ health care. #TrumpCare https://t.co/dCayvmoIEaGood read in the @DailyEmerald on the challenge of rising college costs and what I am working on to make education more affordable in Oregon and nationwide: https://t.co/ZIHFlwkQKVRepublicans are targeting CHIP as a part of an effort to pacify their political base. Kids’ health care shouldn’t be used as a political pawn. https://t.co/NCD6XyxbhiThe @CIA is partaking in an A-Z cover-up of nominee Gina Haspel’s record by selectively declassifying information and stonewalling. The American people deserve to know who Haspel and is and her role during her time at the CIA. https://t.co/m2Szh2WnHx
