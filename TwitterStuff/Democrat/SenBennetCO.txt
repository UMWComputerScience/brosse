Tonight we passed the Senate #FarmBill, a testament to our bipartisan work on the Agriculture Committee. We should move this bill quickly to @POTUS’s desk—especially given the uncertainty communities face over drought, commodity prices, and trade. https://t.co/7Lq0fjO881Thanks for coming to DC to tell your story.

And yesterday we passed #PerkinsCTE reauthorization in HELP Cmt to do just that. https://t.co/oe5OVwdvqyColorado brewers count on healthy #hops to produce the high-quality beer that many of us enjoy. Maintaining top-notch USDA research in #FarmBill is least we can do to support the burgeoning Colorado hop industry. https://t.co/wNV2MIfzbeGreat news: In HELP Cmt today, we passed bipartisan #PerkinsCTE, which means we will finally update the law to help close the skills gap and improve career and technical education for the next generations of Americans entering the workforce.Our PREEMIE Act will help reduce preterm births and improve infant health outcomes across the country. Look forward to continue working with @SenAlexander and committed groups to push this bill over the finish line. https://t.co/yWNa41duTYAbout 1 in 10 babies were born premature in 2016, including nearly 9% in Colorado.

This policy has always been a solution in search of a problem. The President needs to stop sowing religious hostility, division, and anger for political gain.We’re working to designate Camp Hale as the first-ever National Historic Landscape to honor the legacy of soldiers like Blondie. Thanks for sharing, @Max_Sutherburg. https://t.co/1b30SLYbQd#10thMountainDivision that trained at Camp Hale led our nation to victory in World War II &amp; created the outdoor industry we know today.

We intro'd bill to reverse tariffs b/c they should not be used to start a reckless trade war. https://t.co/DkGJQJeMinTake a listen: Pushed @SecretaryRoss to explain why we are so carelessly slapping tariffs on our allies. We still need answers.
https://t.co/aCuKLyq3lFWhat is the national security rational for putting a tariff on the Canadian steel industry with whom we have a trade surplus? We’ve been left in the dark as to why @POTUS imposed these tariffs, but we are well-aware of the consequences they have for American families &amp; industry. https://t.co/2TXbNAenflICYMI: American farmers &amp; ranchers are on the front lines of an escalating trade war, yet @SecretaryRoss told me he was “not in detail familiar” with how the administration plans to help them &amp; that price drops were “exaggerated.” This is unacceptable. 
https://t.co/UhsQhaJLKLProhibiting partisan #gerrymandering is one of the most significant ways we can begin to fix our broken political system. The #FairMaps Act is the first step to enable citizens to regain control of their government.In response to #SCOTUS gerrymandering decisions this week, introduced first federal legislation of its kind to explicitly prohibit partisan gerrymandering &amp; give voters standing to challenge their state’s gerrymandered maps. #FairMaps
 https://t.co/G1X83S0efgICYMI: Sent a letter to the Trump administration last night demanding to know its plans for reuniting separated children with their parents. https://t.co/mbs07njn9CPrecipitous, highly-politicized policies like “zero tolerance” come at enormous human cost. A photo opportunity is not a resolution—mobilization of real resources &amp; comprehensive plan to reunite all of these children is the only solution that meets the standard of American valuesNEW: Letter to @DHSgov &amp; @HHSGov requesting the administration’s plan to reunite children with their parents. Today’s executive order may represent a pause in this cruel policy, but it is far from an enduring or humane resolution. https://t.co/dnaW8EkC3K.@nytimes &amp; @latimes report children will not immediately be reunited with their families based on @POTUS executive order. So what does that mean will happen to them? We need to know. https://t.co/nYvIiBFBu8LIVE on the Senate floor talking about the inhumane separation of children from their parents at our southern border.

Calling on every member of Congress to demand the President end this policy immediately. → https://t.co/RwSubUj0L4I applaud Colorado for beginning the process of joining California and other states in implementing low emission vehicle standards. This is the right decision for families that will save on gas money and businesses that count on America’s competitive edge. https://t.co/kRDkLXfP8sFederal fuel economy emission standards are on track to save American families money at the pump, create jobs, and boost manufacturing—the Trump administration should not block this progress.Today’s SCOTUS decisions fail to resolve one of the most significant dangers to American democracy. Partisan #gerrymandering promotes extremism in our politics and inertia in our government. This harms every American—and every American should have the right to stand against it.Let’s clear up one of the many falsehoods being peddled by this administration: Ending family separation is up to @POTUS. He has the power to end this policy today. https://t.co/rxIzaGPlM5We should never even have to debate whether children are being used as pawns at our southern border.Another memorable year in the books at Denver’s Pride Parade this past weekend. This is one of my favorite family traditions—to spend the day standing up for love in all its forms with a community advocating for positive change. #Pride #PrideMonth @COCenter https://t.co/OFXHHPtYyuAdmin’s separation policy undermines our most sacred American values, fails to keep our country safe, &amp; causes unnecessary trauma for thousands of children/families. Every member of Congress must stand up for these children by demanding that the administration end its policy now.The increasing number of children being ripped away from their parents is sickening. Americans of all political stripes have spoken out against this immoral policy. Yet @POTUS and his administration continue to perpetuate falsehoods and blame others for their own cruelty..@TheJusticeDept: it’s a good book, you should keep reading:

Americans—regardless of party—should be concerned about this reported deal. https://t.co/uZ83v0dS0bIt is not surprising that North Korea derailed these negotiations. Instead of emotional, outburst-driven "diplomacy," the President must do the hard work to develop a comprehensive strategy in coordination with our partners.North Korea’s nuclear program continues to pose a grave threat to the international community and to our allies and servicemembers in the region.Thank you to @SLVHealth CEO Konnie Martin for your testimony in today’s Senate hearing.

A free, objective, and thriving press is essential to all of our communities. https://t.co/67aV0hodXEJust before today’s @amazon fulfillment center grand opening in Aurora, speaking w/ GM &amp; a craftsman about local partnerships. We’re thrilled that Amazon has selected Colorado to open a new center—proof that CO is not just a great place to live, but the best place to do business. https://t.co/ZmTx6HmhgT+ the many essential news outlets in Colorado 

Thank you for the relentless work you do to discover and report the truth. #WorldPressFreedomDay https://t.co/GEPSTL8QwnWeren't able to tune into @KOANewsRadio this morning for our discussion on teacher pay and school funding? #edcolo 

Listen here: https://t.co/Vuf7UFdDFTWe’re celebrating #SmallBusinessWeek at @Ride_Designs. This Littleton small business is using innovative research and design to modernize wheelchairs and improve patient care. https://t.co/I2ytw34wgYWe’re with young innovators from the QUAD Innovation Partnership dedicated to bettering their community in thoughtful, creative ways. Thanks for sharing so many impressive projects aimed at improving access to public transportation. https://t.co/8Mjf1G4HmiHad a great time this morning talking about #edcolo with @KOANewsRadio. Thanks for having me in the studio. https://t.co/z4g2DdRjWkInspired by these young apprentices who are learning the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy. It’s critical that we continue supporting &amp; expanding apprenticeship programs like those at @Pinnacol &amp; @CareerWiseCO to boost workforce development across our state. https://t.co/yk35n0YrR5Looking forward to joining @AprilZesbaugh and @LenzContact in studio this morning. Tune into @KOANewsRadio at 9:40am MT to hear our discussion on the recent teacher rallies and #edcolo funding. https://t.co/yvTM1JcjgtIt’s official: 9 days until we file our petition to save #NetNeutrality and ensure all Coloradans have access to a free &amp; open Internet. We just need #OneMoreVote. RT and help us find one more lawmaker to push this over the finish line. https://t.co/OTL03lfz9GThe Colorado teacher walkouts are part of a growing movement around the country. Read more on why it's so important that we listen to our teachers: https://t.co/ynTiXpcbfvColoradans want to take the long view and invest in our state’s future. To do this, we cannot neglect our schools. As a first step, we must find some way to prune the fiscal underbrush that threatens so deeply our investments in the future. Our children deserve better.Shrinking state budgets have increased class sizes, reduced vital support for students like mental health services &amp; special education, and sometimes slashed school weeks to 4 days. We cannot allow mindless budget shortfalls to force wrongheaded changes to our kids' education.A few important stats: Colorado teachers are now earning less than they did 15 years ago, when compared to inflation. The gap between what a college graduate makes as a teacher and what she could make in another profession in our state is the largest in the country.First and foremost, we must listen to our teachers and educators. It was great to see former colleagues and friends on Friday as they spoke out about their experiences. #edcolo https://t.co/tfJ7BIPjZZICYMI: Thousands of Colorado teachers demonstrated at the state Capitol for better wages and greater support for public education last week. As a former Superintendent, here are some of my thoughts on the rallies. 👇🏼Colorado will continue to lead on water issues by bringing a diverse group of voices to the table—which is especially important as #climatechange creates new pressures in the West. Great conversation at #WaterintheWest2018 &amp; great to see Ag Secs @SecretarySonny &amp; Tom Vilsack. https://t.co/xAQ5ci6bwUThe bipartisan #opioidbill we passed in the HELP Committee this week brings us one step closer to combating the epidemic. We secured three provisions in the bill that will help decrease opioid use &amp; provide those with substance use disorders the most innovative treatments faster.In too many Colorado counties, hospitals are overwhelmed w/shortage of beds &amp; specialists; courts are barely staying above water; jails are crowded b/c of limited resources for #opioid addiction treatment. We must invest in broader effort to respond to a crisis of this magnitude.Today thousands of Colorado teachers are demonstrating at the state Capitol for better wages and greater support for public education. We should listen to them. Op-ed in the @denverpost: https://t.co/ynTiXpcbfvA very serious walk-and-talk in the Senate basement with a future @denverpost reporter. #TakeYourChildToWorkDay https://t.co/QRpwKQ8IcyBut enough from me. Hear about the #OlympiansOnTheHill from the athletes themselves: https://t.co/UYuEnI0uC8For people in Colorado—and for these Olympic athletes—outdoor recreation is not just an avocation; it’s a vocation. #Climatechange is threatening the future of the #Olympics, local economies, and people’s livelihoods across the world. https://t.co/z6g702FoIrArielle Gold—Olympic snowboarder from Steamboat Springs—is using her platform to teach the next generation of Americans about the devastating effects of #climatechange. Athletes like @arielletgold are on the front lines, speaking out to save our planet. #COProud #VoicesOfCO https://t.co/993Fz8o0RhThese 5 Olympic medalists are on the Hill this week urging Congress to take action on #climatechange. We must continue bringing new voices into the climate debate to push past partisan rhetoric and finally address this growing threat. #OlympiansOnTheHill https://t.co/5vEFFYoAWxCan’t wait to meet you, Naomi. If you’re anything like your dad, I’ll be awaiting some hard-hitting questions. https://t.co/L0sLzbbS9EWe need to make the investment in our kids—for their education, roads/bridges, health care—that our parents &amp; grandparents were willing to make in us. Instead, we are burdening our children with massive debts before their futures even begin. My remarks from @SenateFinance: https://t.co/hP4MgRpIKNThese tokens from @campesinasunite are how farmworkers get paid for their work—and are worth pennies on the dollar. As one advocate told me, “They often don’t even have women bathrooms in the field.” We’ll keep up efforts until all workplaces are safe &amp; just. #AllWorkSafeWork https://t.co/rXubMj4fNKMet an incredibly strong group of women advocating for farm worker protections this week. @campesinasunite played an instrumental role in launching #TimesUp to support those who experience sexual harassment. They’re also fighting for immigration reform and fair wages. https://t.co/Zz3dpML3Z9A reminder that this proposal is coming from a HUD Secretary who wanted to spend $31K on a dining set. Raising rent for people who can least afford it is just plain wrong—especially given the administration’s reckless use of taxpayer dollars. We are better than this as a country. https://t.co/2q5XN7nTYU"There is no Planet B." - @EmmanuelMacron #ActOnClimateAnd we have a lot of respect for @arielletgold who is joining us in the Senate today to talk about #climatechange. 

What questions do you have for us about how climate change is affecting winter sports, the #Olympics, and Colorado? #OlympiansOnTheHill https://t.co/mk25zGZdlqIf you ever needed more reason to believe we must reform our campaign finance system, this is it. A government by the people for the people should not reward those who can write the biggest check.  https://t.co/f1SuFBYmBKWe’re talking about #climatechange today with Olympic champions—including Coloradan @arielletgold—to urge Congress to #ActOnClimate. What questions do you have for the Olympians on how climate change affects their sports?

What are yours? #NationalBookDay #BennetBookshelf https://t.co/Ww0dAEJhyaToday, the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality officially takes effect. We must fight back to keep the internet open &amp; free. All we need in the Senate is #OneMoreVote to pass a resolution to protect Colorado’s internet users. Help us find that vote.We need fresh policies like my #ChildTaxCredit w/ @SenSherrodBrown to cut child poverty nearly in half &amp; like #MedicareX w/ @timkaine to increase quality health care coverage. @DLeonhardt is right: “It’s time to dream big again,” but we also must turn these dreams into reality. https://t.co/MRhsVSbE1bWe must have a conversation on #climatechange that includes Coloradans across political and rural-urban divides. Farmers and ranchers—often excluded from that conversation—are stewards of land and water who are already thinking about the next generation. https://t.co/oFcXPQGJELSome of my favorite memories are exploring beautiful mountains &amp; lakes in Colorado. It's up to us to preserve these pristine places for the next generation. Good reminder on #EarthDay for myself &amp; colleagues in both parties to think hard about how we can protect our only planet. https://t.co/9emN99JuWHImportant read about how we’re preparing for the next #FarmBill. We’re talking about drought, commodity prices, trade, and more. A bipartisan bill in the Senate is the only way to produce responsive legislation for Coloradans. 
https://t.co/isfW1pl0I9For over a decade, leaders in SW Colorado worked tirelessly to protect the San Juan Mountains. This wk, introduced legislation w/County Commissioner Hilary Cooper to create wilderness areas &amp; uphold our public lands legacy for the next generation, including for her daughter Maia. https://t.co/4rOUUWi77219 years after the #ColumbineShooting, we continue to honor the memories of the 12 students &amp; teacher who were taken too soon.

We couldn't be more proud that you're representing Colorado around the world. #COproud #paralympics https://t.co/MJ2T4zkwmbBelieving in climate change should be a requirement for an EPA Administrator. @EPAScottPruitt has failed on that front &amp; others—putting polluters' priorities above Coloradans' health &amp; safety. That's why we introduced a resolution calling for his resignation. #PollutingPruitt https://t.co/cgIaZLMGmLWe cannot allow local press—a core pillar of our democracy—to fall away without a fight. That’s why @GovofCO declared this #ColoradoJournalismWeek. It’s past time we all take a stand for journalism. #RealNewsCO  

https://t.co/u0hgwzzzPOIt was inspiring to see so many Colorado teachers march at the Capitol yesterday. As more walkouts take place next week—continuing to build on a national movement—we stand with teachers &amp; educators in calling for the pay they deserve &amp; the funding their schools need to thrive. https://t.co/NAz1SbNBiFBarbara Bush will forever be remembered by those who knew her, loved her, and were impacted by her dedication to public service. We'll commemorate her legacy by continuing her work toward universal literacy.In Colorado, we’re seeing cities like Boulder and Pueblo recognize climate change and choosing to go 100% renewable. We’re going to see more of this around the country as we weave these local goals into our national strategy for a clean energy economy. #POLITICOEnergyIt should be a disqualification for the EPA Administrator not to believe in climate change. It’s time for @EPAScottPruitt to resign.The corruption of inaction that exists because of money in politics &amp; Citizens United decision has plagued Congress, especially when it comes to #climatechange &amp; #renewableenergy. It’s the ideas not proposed &amp; bills not signed that are detrimental to our future. #POLITICOEnergyWe forfeited a moral and economic position in the world by pulling out of the #ParisAgreement. But despite @POTUS, clean energy business owners and leaders will continue to innovate across our country. #POLITICOEnergyAs the Trump administration tries to roll back progress on renewable energy, we're talking about the private sector's role in helping lead our nation in the 21st century. Tune in with @POLITICOLive to watch now #POLITICOEnergy → https://t.co/1eAIinehwvHere’s one of many articles reporting exactly what we expected: 

“Most of the extra cash from tax savings is going into the pockets of stock shareholders through dividend increases and companies buying back their own stock in hopes of boosting its price.”
https://t.co/7UdpirssNFBecause of the irresponsible #GOPTaxBill, we are going to have about a trillion dollar deficit next year—and not during a recession, but at nearly full employment. We’re borrowing that money from our children &amp; grandchildren to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. #TaxDayWe cannot forget history: 
-Clinton left office w/surplus
-GW Bush left office after cutting taxes twice w/$1.2 tril deficit
-GOP didn't lift a finger to help Americans in '08 recession in name of “fiscal responsibility"
-After #GOPTaxBill, we'll see $981 billion deficit next yr https://t.co/GJ5EBmNutpUnder #GOPTaxBill, 90 mil Americans making less than $50k/year see an avg of $192 extra in their pockets. Compare that to the 572,000 Americans at the top who now make over $1 mil extra/year. They will receive an avg tax cut of $64k this year. How does that make sense? #TaxDayAs Americans file their taxes today, we’re taking the opportunity to revisit how fundamentally flawed the #GOPTaxBill is. Watch LIVE: https://t.co/0t21kQaRtb #TaxDayAcross the country, Latino students are less likely than others to graduate with a four-year college degree. We need to fix this. Join our LIVE conversation today with @thehill to discuss college access &amp; affordability: https://t.co/Hzl22qmvWC https://t.co/LVgjPPhAlVWith one of the top aerospace economies in the country, Colorado is the natural home for the #SpaceSymposium.

These young Coloradans asked terrific questions on topics from immigration to health care. As they become the leaders our nation needs, I’ll keep working in Washington to help secure the future they deserve. https://t.co/O0sZ9RJVjKThe people of Colorado &amp; all Americans deserve a leader who recognizes science, believes in #climatechange, and takes action to protect our children’s health &amp; boost our economy’s competitiveness. That shouldn’t be too much to ask, yet @EPAScottPruitt has failed on every measure..@EPAScottPruitt must respond to the many unanswered ethical questions asked by taxpayers &amp; lawmakers, and he must resign. WATCH: https://t.co/P8U3OlBuNU https://t.co/KOiNeDdpnHEach year, women in Colorado are typically paid $8,058 less than men. For Latinas, that number jumps to $27,323. If that’s not evidence enough to change laws &amp; policies preventing equal pay for equal work, I don’t know what is. Join us to support legislation to close the #paygap.In Colorado, over 50 local government officials, business leaders, @GovofCO, and @CDPHE have spoken out against @EPAScottPruitt’s reckless decision to roll back fuel efficiency standards. Our state knows this is backward. RT if you stand with us. https://t.co/FM46y8RcBQFor American families, incomes have not kept up with rising costs of living. Coloradans tell me they feel trapped in a cycle of working so they have health insurance, but then spending too much on child care so they can work. Closing the #paygap is essential to break this cycle.#EqualPayDay represents how far women, on average, must work into 2018 to earn the same pay as men did in 2017. It’s mid-April. This is unacceptable. We must close the #paygap, pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct, and fight for policies that reflect our ideals as a nation.#NAFTA renegotiations should not conclude unless:
1. @POTUS keeps his promise to address unfair Canadian #dairy practices
2. Existing market access to Mexico &amp; Canada for our farmers &amp; ranchers is maintained 
It’s up to @USTradeRep Lighthizer to follow through. https://t.co/aIbKn4QYreFor an administration that touts itself as “pro-business,” I don’t understand @EPAScottPruitt’s decision to roll back fuel efficiency standards. 
Is he trying to make American cars less competitive? 
Is he trying to stifle innovation? 
Pruitt needs to go.Commonsense vehicle standards that were developed in collaboration with industry &amp; will save families money should not be the victim of @EPAScottPruitt’s thoughtless agenda. 
We’re fighting back from the Senate. LIVE now: https://t.co/lgeo0jpefkWe shouldn't have to keep repeating this: https://t.co/y5KbfB4Rm8Who could have known tax cuts wouldn’t pay for themselves? Oh wait… https://t.co/ZzHhhg1Ci8We stand with @DenverPost journalists–&amp; journalists around our state/country–who are doing everything in their power to salvage newsrooms while continuing to inform communities. Thanks for all of your hard work to defend free press, use edited content &amp; preserve our civic future.As the Editorial Board points out: “Reduction in quality leads to a reduction of trust.” In a hyper-partisan &amp;“fake news” oriented world, a lack of trust in local papers is the last thing our society needs. A free &amp; vigilant press is essential to our function as a democracy.Now the Rocky Mountain News is gone, and today over two dozen employees at @DenverPost are being shown the door (after years of other major cuts). This editorial is worth a read, because, as the headline indicates, we must save the Denver Post: https://t.co/67aV0hodXEWhen I was Superintendent of Denver Public Schools, Rocky Mountain News &amp; @DenverPost held each other accountable—resulting in accurate, high-quality journalism. I often say my job would have been very different were it not for reliable &amp; objective local press.A bit of a long thread coming up, but it’s an issue I’ve felt strongly about my entire career—and even more so over the last few years, as we’ve seen a shift away from edited content toward partisan press.Congratulations to my colleague and friend, @SenDuckworth! Susan and I wish all the best to you &amp; your family as you welcome Maile Pearl and make Senate history today. https://t.co/at1vkrdj39Before @EPAScottPruitt was confirmed, I voiced concerns w/his failure to recognize #climatechange &amp; science. His tenure confirmed those fears—he's failed to implement @EPA's mission &amp; protect Colorado's kids. His actions also warrant ethical concern. He should resign immediately..@Coloradoan: @EPAScottPruitt decision to roll back fuel efficiency standards could cost the avg Colorado household up to $2,700 in gas savings by 2030. This is a step in the wrong direction for our state’s economy, health &amp; fight against #climatechange. 
https://t.co/ALuW8bpDkL"One of the takeaways at Bennet's town halls is that all politics is indeed local." From "the mountain bike guy" to "Crested Butte mayor," talking to Coloradans is why I enjoy #TownHalls. It's the #VoicesOfCO that drive my work in Washington. Editorial: https://t.co/DgsAa5TnXYThinking back to a quote that drives the work I strive to do each day to leave this country better for our kids:
"There is nothing new about poverty...What is new...is that we now have the resources, we now have the skills, we now have the technique to get rid of poverty." #MLK50Every year on his birthday, we march in Denver’s Marade to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. &amp; his Dream. Today we think back to his assassination 50 years ago &amp; honor him with continued action to fulfill what he deemed the “promises of democracy.” #MLK50 https://t.co/U8UwlvFfb1For months, my colleagues &amp; I waited for @POTUS to meaningfully engage on a bipartisan immigration bill to increase border security resources &amp; protect #Dreamers. Unfortunately, he failed to lead, &amp; rather than find real solutions on immigration, he continues to stoke fear. 2/2I have long advocated for strengthening border security as part of a comprehensive immigration reform package. Border security resources should be deployed with careful consideration, not as a politically motivated response. 1/2Congratulations to the City of Durango for opening Lake Nighthorse for recreation. For years we worked with @DurangoRec @CityofDurango @usbr &amp; @SenCoryGardner to advocate for public access. Now Coloradans can fish, boat, &amp; paddle board on this great lake. https://t.co/nEgTQy0hGn"I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars." 

MLK Jr.'s words ring just as true today as they did 50 years ago. Although our politics may seem dark, I'm optimistic. There's more work for us ahead. #MLK50I didn’t forget about that #MarchMadness bet @SenatorTester… @NovaMBB went all the way &amp; I’m ready to celebrate with some of your finest beef jerky. https://t.co/7VfvZdGKmgColoradans have finally received $18 million in oil &amp; gas revenues that have been rightfully theirs for years following the cleanup of Anvil Points.

American consumers &amp; families deserve to know about his involvement with the oil &amp; auto industries. https://t.co/SgXXUDCpj6.@EPAScottPruitt's decision will hurt American families, American manufacturing, American jobs, and American innovation. The only winner is big oil..@EPAScottPruitt's decision will lead to more carbon pollution..@EPAScottPruitt's decision will result in fewer jobs..@EPAScottPruitt's decision will disincentivize American manufacturers to create the most efficient cars of the future..@EPAScottPruitt's decision will make families pay more for gas at the pump.Today’s announcement by @EPAScottPruitt that @EPA will roll back fuel efficiency standards is a step in the wrong direction. Here's why:It's our responsibility to continue the movement César Chávez inspired by fighting to end discrimination and ensure social and economic justice. On #CesarChavezDay, we remember his legacy in Colorado &amp; across the country.Industrial #hemp is an important &amp; legitimate agricultural crop in Colorado, which is why I’m working in Washington to make this true across the country.

First up: Helping rural communities compete for $600 million in federal funding (secured in yesterday’s spending bill) by ensuring federal agencies provide timely answers to potential applicants.Colorado’s local leaders, especially in rural areas, have been at the forefront of innovative approaches to deliver high-speed, reliable, and affordable broadband to their communities. We must do everything we can to build on their work. That’s why I'm launching #ConnectColorado.Our farmers and ranchers want to be able to export the goods that they are producing here in the United States. They don’t need sympathy; they need the administration to act responsibly. https://t.co/kN7xKcA2JwInstead of lurching from one short-term spending measure to another, the #omnibus provides some much needed certainty. It includes a #FireFix that is particularly important to Colorado, and invests in #cleanenergy, LWCF, #infrastructure &amp; #opioid abuse prevention &amp; treatment..@facebook's admission and willingness to address its shortsightedness should force us to have an honest and transparent conversation about how social media companies secure and monetize our data.Eight years ago, we raised concerns with Mark Zuckerberg about how @Facebook used and shared our personal information: https://t.co/EAQWoiUcpOThe Trump administration needs to behave responsibly when it comes to trade. That’s why I pressed USTR Lighthizer today on the real effects of the admin's rhetoric &amp; trade policies on Colorado’s farmers and ranchers. In an already tough farm economy, they stand to bear the brunt. https://t.co/hdMkCFceIqThis bipartisan #FireFix transforms &amp; modernizes the @forestservice's capacity to restore forest health and mitigate &amp; fight wildfires. It allows the Forest Service to complete the entirety of its mission, without being undermined by the pressures of fire. 3/3Because of the pressures that #wildfires have brought to the West, as well as the challenges of climate change &amp; development, the antiquated way we pay for firefighting needed dramatic change. 2/3NEWS: We secured a #FireFix in the #omnibusbill. This + other land management priorities are the result of years of foundational bipartisan work. @forestservice plays an important role in CO's economy &amp; its ability to budget effectively is critical to our economic success. 1/3.@POTUS should heed the Senate Intel Committee’s bipartisan recommendations for securing our voting systems and deterring those who aim to interfere in our elections. His inaction is confounding &amp; leaves our democracy vulnerable to future attacks—from Russia and others.When the #MethaneRule was created in 2016, 75% of Westerners supported it. That’s because public feedback was considered in the process. @SecretaryZinke needs to do the same before he revises the rule. This affects too many Coloradans to act without their input.The #MethaneRule protects the health &amp; safety of Western communities. Before @BLMNational revises it, @SecretaryZinke must listen to public input. With @RepRaulGrijalva &amp; Western lawmakers, urging @Interior to hold public hearings &amp; extend comment period. https://t.co/cO0ybx6VMwWe need a process that properly considers our political goals in Yemen and the region and a strategy to achieve them, as well as human rights, humanitarian conditions, the cost of conflict, and our geopolitical interests.Voted to begin debate on Yemen Resolution bc I believe we’re overdue to have a discussion on U.S. policy toward Yemen. I would have preferred for that debate to start in the Senate Foreign Relations Cmt, where we should also consider authorization of military force more broadly.On #NationalAgDay, we’re celebrating the farmers and ranchers for the food, feed, &amp; fuel they provide, the land &amp; water they conserve, and the security they bring our rural communities. Thank you for all you do. https://t.co/uF0Dde8C9yIf the administration is serious about our children's safety, this commission would include a large, diverse group of voices to consider all perspectives &amp; possible solutions. Including only 4 members of @POTUS' cabinet does not give me confidence in the outcomes of this effort. https://t.co/pHbvaFP885During #WomensHistoryMonth, introduced a resolution to recognize the contributions of Latinas in Colorado &amp; and around the country—from developing acequias, to driving innovation, to advocating for civil rights. https://t.co/2w6F1XWr5BWe’ve seen too many instances of bad actors using social media tools to degrade public debate here and around the world. It’s time for an honest and transparent conversation about how we can ensure these technologies strengthen our society, not tear us apart. https://t.co/KafAJjcSZVGrand Junction is the ideal home for @BLMNational headquarters &amp; we intend to show @SecretaryZinke exactly why. Reasonable cost of living, high quality of life &amp; support from the community—all ways to attract top talent &amp; improve the agency. https://t.co/CVGX8itM6mColoradans are proud to know that for decades to come people around the world will say: "There goes the Colorado." 
With veterans, families &amp; the Commissioning Committee, we celebrated the newly-commissioned #USSColorado &amp; her crew today. Wishing you fair winds &amp; following seas. https://t.co/cnxsCS2xpUIn the years ahead, Coloradans will be standing behind the #USSColorado &amp; her crew as she silently protects our interests around the world. She will lead missions that shape this century. It was an honor to have been part of the commissioning ceremony. https://t.co/GiZpT5MAx8Any effort to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation would create a constitutional crisis and undermine the rule of law​. The deputy attorney general should let the investigation continue without political interference. https://t.co/aHyLBaoBDKA windy, Colorado welcome to the Naval Submarine Base in Groton, CT with my daughter, Anne, for the commissioning of the #USSColorado. Live stream the ceremony starting soon: https://t.co/xBXzqjDOWZ https://t.co/ojCuxfHggpThis is a sad moment for journalism in Colorado. Edited content and local journalism are essential components of our democratic republic. We must do all we can to secure access to a free and vigilant press.  https://t.co/aQuxrSQarD.@SecretaryZinke: We can think of no better permanent home for the @BLMNational headquarters than Grand Junction, CO. Come visit the Western Slope and see for yourself. 

CC: @DOIDepSec  &amp; @SenCoryGardner https://t.co/qZmoUquCSLThis is a long overdue step toward imposing sanctions Congress passed w/ overwhelming bipartisan support in response to Russia’s destabilizing activities &amp; election interference. Without further action, @POTUS is leaving the door open to future interference—from Russia &amp; others.We are just months away from midterm elections &amp; @POTUS advisors continue to warn of Russian interference &amp; disinformation efforts. This partial action does not replace need for comprehensive strategy to deter future threats, including to critical infrastructure &amp; election system https://t.co/t5MsQSAIyeDown to the wire, but finished filling out my #MarchMadness bracket. Putting a 6-pack of Colorado's finest IPA on the line with my friend @SenatorTester. https://t.co/TIVFdjFvDsAt a time when China is spending more than $400 billion a year on research, we should not be scaling back programs like @ARPAE as @POTUS’ budget proposes. Watching Appropriations hearing &amp; holding @SecretaryPerry to his assurance to maintain this innovative energy program.This month, there will be science fairs in schools across Colorado. If we do our job, we can ensure that, when those kids graduate from college, @ARPAE not only exists but continues to thrive. Read my full remarks from #ARPAE18: https://t.co/g7Rj6YURAsDespite @POTUS’ budget proposal that eliminates @ARPAE, we’ve been assured from @ENERGY that @SecretaryPerry fully supports the program. Let’s make sure he follows through on this assurance in his Appropriations testimony this morning.Never gets old, @Rockies. Happy #PiDay! https://t.co/glFireirqyNo matter what our political environment, the collective imagination of the American people is an awesome force. We will find ways to innovate around our challenges, unlock the promise of #cleanenergy, &amp; maintain America’s leadership at the frontier of human innovation. #ARPAE18 https://t.co/3XIBW9fH7kThank you @ARPAE for having me. We must ensure ARPA-E &amp; other funding sources for innovative energy technologies exist for the next generation of scientists, researchers, &amp; entrepreneurs. I will do my part to ensure this administration secures these critical programs. #ARPAE18 https://t.co/KIPtbRfeXzFacetiming Anne &amp; Caroline to see thousands of students walking out of school in CO. As a parent, every time a mass shooting occurs, I have a conversation with my daughters—a conversation we should not need to have. Our nation’s kids are speaking up. We need to listen. #Enough https://t.co/3RGAOK4KrPMy daughters &amp; their friends just sent these photos of the thousands gathered outside Denver's East High School. Inspired by all of the students across Colorado demanding that we take action and say #NeverAgain. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/20ashb1gKjWe remember those who were killed in the Columbine High School massacre in 1999:

Look forward to seeing Colorado projects featured from @NREL, @ColoradoStateU, @CUBoulder, @coschoolofmines &amp; more.APPLY TODAY: Attend the Colorado Capital Conference this summer to interact with our nation’s leaders in Washington, D.C.

This loan supports our broader efforts to incent the building of more resilient infrastructure with smarter &amp; cleaner technologies. https://t.co/cr04yYb9N2Because of issues w/ #VeteransChoice, sent a bipartisan letter to @SecShulkin urging him hold Health Net—the primary contractor in CO—accountable for its frustrating &amp; completely avoidable customer service problems &amp; late payments to community providers. https://t.co/nf63KJLuTNOur office has worked w/ veterans &amp; community providers to address problems w/ #VeteransChoice Program. We'll keep pressure on @DeptVetAffairs until vets receive high-quality care in a manner that makes sense for them &amp; providers get payment they're owed.
https://t.co/2blk0jtHn3Today @SecretaryZinke announced “the check is in the mail” for CO communities waiting on $18 mil in revenues from Anvil Points. Since arriving to Senate in 2009, I’ve pushed for this outcome—including w/ this letter to Zinke. This is great news for Coloradans on Western Slope. https://t.co/kSONrBqBvMInstability in our foreign policy puts us at risk. We need diplomatic ability to address profound foreign policy challenges, such as North Korean nuclear program, Russian interference &amp; increasing Chinese influence. @StateDept needs leadership &amp; investment, not chaos &amp; discord..@POTUS clearly has a hard time with someone who even softly challenges his haphazard, tweet-based foreign policy. He is doubling down on a small-minded approach to a complicated world. 
https://t.co/uSx7dysSsr.@POTUS' inaction on Russian election interference not only opens the door to future interference, it invites it—from Russia and others. He should condemn Putin’s anti-Semitic remarks, and he should take steps to hold those responsible for election meddling accountable.For any young professional in need of some #MondayMotivation, take a listen to this clip from @SXMPOTUS interview with my Chief of Staff. I can guarantee your first day of work went better than his as an assistant on Capitol Hill: https://t.co/Gr3tJilRqV.@BetsyDeVosED just told us she has not visited any under-performing schools as Sec of Education. It becomes more apparent every day that her appointment is an insult to students, families, teachers, principals, and communities that are fighting to improve their public schools. https://t.co/PEu4tBO6ZqCould not agree more—Coloradans know we need to fix the @forestservice budget by working across the aisle. It’s why we’ll keep pushing to include a fire fix in the upcoming omnibus. https://t.co/pdw7ALuLyMThe administration must ensure any steps taken advance our interests and credibly address the threat without elevating the North Korean regime. That includes working with our partners and allies in the region, enforcing sanctions, and fully resourcing our diplomatic posts.The stakes are high. DPRK’s nuclear program poses a grave threat to the international community.Lastly, my wife &amp; daughters inspire me every single day. Whether as professors, students, performers, or marchers—they’re pushing boundaries and standing up for progress in a time that needs more women in charge. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/p59zs6VIVpAt @uscapitol last wk, met @gitanjaliarao. @Boyscouts delegate, Top Young Scientist of 2017, accomplished pianist…I was so impressed I called her mother in CO to tell her about our meeting. The world will be watching as she continues to invent &amp; inspire. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/uN0PijFDyQIn Syrian @ZaatariCamp, this group of young women showed grit &amp; determination to take control of their futures, learning new languages and skills, and sharing information with one another. They embody the “Press for Progress” theme that we reflect on this #InternationalWomensDay. https://t.co/XLwQhfjNhZOn this #InternationalWomensDay, taking a moment to recognize some of the powerful, resilient women who have inspired me and countless others this past year.Retaining ski fees in our national forests will strengthen the partnership b/n @forestservice &amp; our outdoor rec industry and provide new opportunities in our mountain communities. This is a good example of bipartisan, commonsense policy. https://t.co/QCAiOElHY3Train horns have disturbed too many Colorado communities for too long. We've worked for years to make commonsense adjustments to Train Horn Rule. Sent letter urging new @USDOTFRA Admin to finish the job &amp; make the rule more flexible &amp; cost-effective. https://t.co/nWNZUwGWOjOur communities are being ripped apart by #opioid addiction, but they're also seeing promise in new approaches to combat the epidemic. New bill would invest in innovative programs, based on successful pilot in CO, to reduce opioid usage around the country: https://t.co/b0qXWRwq9LWe're LIVE hearing from survivors, parents &amp; law enforcement on how we can reform our nation's gun laws &amp; keep our families safe. More than anything, we need to listen to our communities to inform our actions in Congress. Watch &amp; hear their testimonies: https://t.co/aF4RhnfQzVMy hope is that we can find a way to build a diverse coalition that includes farmers and ranchers in Colorado to move forward and #ActOnClimate. This doesn't need to be a partisan issue. #AnswerWithAction https://t.co/SpOiXEbW1DWe're LIVE with @Patagonia Action Works discussing the importance of breaking the political gridlock around climate change. #AnswerWithAction Watch here: https://t.co/8w1C3T6l6Q https://t.co/9xtYJhpRAGThere’s no problem we couldn’t solve if lawmakers in Washington took their jobs as seriously as County Commissioners do in Colorado.

B/c of today's manufactured deadline, thousands more are at risk. We’ll keep fighting for a legislative fix, but let’s be clear: the onus falls on Trump to fix the crisis he created."As we look back &amp; cheer the exploits of Team USA in #PyeongChang2018, let's also honor the history that allowed our athletes to be there.

We need a thoughtful and aggressive response to China’s overproduction of steel and aluminum, but blanket tariffs are not the answer. https://t.co/HoFxgTkfMeIn Otero County last year, met police who don’t just patrol streets, but also must be trained to use antidotes for overdoses. Coloradans deserve action from Congress on #opioidcrisis.
