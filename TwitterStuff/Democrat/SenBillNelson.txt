There are thousands of Puerto Rican families struggling to recover from last year’s storms &amp; they need our help. Great seeing so many dedicated people at the Nuestro Futuro symposium today where leaders from around the state are gathering to find ways to help Puerto Ricans. https://t.co/LPQWDJcKRIGood news. We just passed a farm bill to provide scientists another $125 million to fight the deadly citrus disease, known as greening. We need all the help we can get to stop this devastating disease as soon as possible or we won’t be growing oranges in Florida much longer.Just hours after we asked for an investigation, HHS’s Inspector General announced that it has opened an investigation into the agency’s treatment of the more than 2,000 kids who were ripped from their parents at the border. https://t.co/kooADxcTzrOn Saturday, FEMA is going to stop providing housing assistance to hundreds of families still displaced after Hurricane Maria. I just called on the Senate to immediately pass my bill to force FEMA to continue providing help to these families - but GOP objected. Watch here: https://t.co/5yUIbGZqQuIn two days FEMA will stop providing housing assistance to families still displaced from Hurricane Maria. At 1:15 pm, I’ll ask the Senate to take up and immediately pass my bill to require FEMA to continue providing help to these families. Watch here: https://t.co/6P8yZeN2S8Justice Kennedy was a balanced, consensus candidate nominated by President Reagan. I expect President Trump to do the same. I believe the American people should be given a chance to express their views in the upcoming election, before the Senate exercises its constitutional duty.Have filed an amendment to the farm bill with @marcorubio to authorize an additional $1.27 billion in food assistance for the people of Puerto Rico. https://t.co/erd08FNsTlIt’s always great to spend time with kids like Daniela, Abby and Lucy. They are the reason why we are pushing so hard to pass legislation that would create nationally designated children’s hospital networks to provide them the full range of health services they need. https://t.co/NNXpBHVkXiIt was great meeting with the River Kidz from the Treasure Coast today as they work to raise awareness about the dangers of toxic algae and the need to finish restoring the Everglades so we can repair the natural flow of water south as Mother Nature intended. https://t.co/SmqMzUbo9zToday, I and 47 other senators are calling on President Trump to abandon his administration’s latest efforts to take the guarantee of health care coverage away from more than 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions – including 7.8 million in Florida. https://t.co/IGlfHL5QUtHave just been told by HHS that they are planning to set up ”family camps” where children and parents would be detained together. I asked what is a “family camp” and how would it work? They said they don’t know yet.I met with Col. Kirk, the head of the Jacksonville district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, today to go over its plans to restore the Everglades and speed up construction on the Herbert Hoover Dike to get it done by 2022, instead of 2025. https://t.co/V6342twXjjCuando el jefe del HHS se presente ante el congreso mañana, le haré una serie de preguntas acerca de los esfuerzos para reunificar a los 2.300 niños que fueron separaron de sus padres. https://t.co/603mPmNDevI have put the head of HHS on notice that when he testifies before Congress tomorrow, I plan to ask him a series of questions regarding his agency’s efforts to reunite 2,300 children who separated from their parents and I expect answers. https://t.co/PLE36z2wDiEstoy en la ciudad de Homestead en la Florida y acabo de visitar el centro en donde 70 niños, quienes fueron separados de sus familias están siendo retenidos. Los oficiales no me permiten ver los niños. Me dijeron que todavía no hay un plan para reunirlos con sus padres. https://t.co/IHCAhCoToLJust visited the Homestead, Fla. facility where 70 kids who were separated from their families are being held. They would not let me see the kids. They told me they have no plan in place to reunify them with their parents. https://t.co/mpwOP7eNKvOn I-4. Traffic is bad. Again, I am officially calling on Gov. Scott to let us build high-speed rail. We would be riding at 180 mph between Orlando and Tampa right now had he not turned away $2.4 billion in 2011.Pres. Trump’s order does nothing to help the 2,300 kids already separated from their families. I am heading back to Homestead, FL Saturday to check on 94 kids there who were separated from their parents to find out exactly what’s being done to reunite them with their families.It’s clear this executive order does not solve the problem. The Trump administration needs to reunite these families immediately. https://t.co/7sMyxsfO7kThe president’s order does not solve this problem. It does nothing to reunify the 2,300 children who have been taken from their parents. https://t.co/jo2knb8eT8The power to end this shameful chapter in our nation’s history lies with the president and his pen. He can sign an executive order today. He doesn’t need Congress to act. He and he alone is allowing this shameful practice to continue. And he, and he alone, can stop it right now. https://t.co/YNtQzu4XgYThere's nothing in the law that requires children be taken from their parents. There's nothing in the law that requires them to rip an infant from a parent's arms. The decision to enact this shameful policy was a decision made by this administration and this administration alone. https://t.co/8RKeBz9E6gJust learned from HHS that there are 94 children in the Homestead, Florida facility who were separated from their families. The Trump administration’s actions today to block us from checking on these kids is inexcusable.This is not a good day for our country. The Trump administration will not let us check on the welfare of the children being held in Homestead, FL. These are kids who were taken from their moms and dads. They are scared. And this administration should be ashamed of itself. https://t.co/DbrknSuEITThe administration’s action today to deny us access to their Homestead, Florida facility where they are holding 1,000 migrant children is against EVERYTHING that we as a country stand for. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. https://t.co/Zv8Py0f3M8The company running this facility told us we would be welcomed to tour the facility. HHS then denied us entry and said that they need “two weeks notice” to allow us inside. That’s ridiculous and it’s clear this administration is hiding something.HHS just blocked us from entering its facility in Homestead, Florida to check on the welfare of the children being held here. They are obviously hiding something, and we are going to get to the bottom of this. https://t.co/q4m6Zd0ck2Heading to Homestead, Florida tomorrow to check on the roughly 1,000 migrant children reportedly being held there. The Trump administration needs to stop this inhumane policy of separating families at the border immediately – we, as a society, are better than this!Sea level rise is a real threat to Florida - that’s why I introduced a bill to help coastal communities become more resilient. We need to act now before it’s too late. https://t.co/4AgRGS9z0yThe president told a US general to create a new Space Force as 6th branch of military today, which generals tell me they don’t want. Thankfully the president can’t do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many important missions at stake. https://t.co/uYzqg1W8nE7.8 million Floridians with pre-existing conditions could lose their guarantee of health coverage if a lawsuit – supported by the state of Florida – is successful. I just met with some folks in Orlando today to hear what it could mean for them. https://t.co/K7kBaalmdXThere is no legitimate reason to separate families at the border. None. This needs to stop. I have called on the Trump administration to end this inhumane policy immediately! https://t.co/f6Q6lEBVpvAfter more than 50 years of war with the FARC, the people of Colombia have a new leader.

And a special thanks to all the brave men and women who are currently serving in our nation’s military. Thank you for your service! https://t.co/QytnL1ftvyIn just over two weeks, thousands of American families still displaced from their homes after last year’s hurricanes could suddenly find themselves without a place to live. We can’t let that happen. I am calling on the Senate to act before it’s too late. https://t.co/DhYDa9HCl8Kia and Hyundai owners need to know if their cars are safe to drive. Today, I called on the NHTSA to look into what’s causing these spontaneous fires in Kia and Hyundai vehicles, and what’s being done to prevent them from happening. https://t.co/MbCzRjve1M7.8 million Floridians have a pre-existing condition.

https://t.co/dibmMRfeacThe attack on Pulse nightclub was an act of terror and hate, and it was an attack on our fundamental American values of equality and dignity. Two years later, our resolve to end gun violence must be stronger than ever. It’s time for Congress to act. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/SxVquJgYOgThis is a first step, but it’s a shaky first step. The president gave up joint military exercises with our South Korean ally in exchange for a vague commitment to work toward denuclearization—a promise the North Korean dictatorship has broken before. https://t.co/4VxBWWQMX3Today marks two years since the tragic shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Join us in honoring and remembering the 49 lives lost that day, those who survived and the first responders who put their own lives on the line to save so many more: https://t.co/9s5cAk8mOEIt’s been 122 days since Congress approved disaster funding to help Florida and Puerto Rico recover from last year’s hurricanes – yet several communities still haven’t received a dime. That’s unacceptable. I’m calling on the administration to release those funds immediately. https://t.co/APL9JAXg4q.@SenKamalaHarris and I have filed a bill to require FEMA to develop a new system for determining the number of deaths caused by a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Maria. The people of Puerto Rico deserve to know the truth. https://t.co/8Z7MBEr9qVTomorrow marks two years since the horrific shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. I just met with Tiara Parker, one of the survivors of that terrible massacre, to hear her story and talk about what more we can do to protect our communities from such senseless gun violence. https://t.co/YePuP1ZXBX#NetNeutrality protections end today, eliminating the internet as we know it.

And for the safety of all those involved in this tragic situation. https://t.co/SjllUsFtgtThe photos of flooded streets in South Florida don't lie. And neither does the water that’s sometimes past your ankles when you’re walking around some of Florida’s coastal communities. https://t.co/nMKnU82djbThis is big news – @NASA says it has just discovered new clues in the mystery of whether life once existed on Mars. This is yet another reason why we need to get our astronauts to the Red Planet as soon as possible as part of our venture into the unknown. https://t.co/mAdzUWYlTZCongress has officially approved our bill to rename a Tallahassee VA clinic in honor of Sgt.

I can think of no more fitting tribute to his extraordinary service to our country. https://t.co/vePbIdo5x7Thanks to the NASA bill we passed last year to allow commercial space companies to expand their activities on NASA properties, SpaceX is now building a major new facility at KSC that will bring more jobs and provide yet another boost to the local economy. https://t.co/ZTr4R3SsfPThe administration has gone to court to take the guarantee of health care coverage away from 7.8 million Floridians with pre-existing conditions. That’s outrageous. And I’m going to fight it with everything I have until the cows come home. https://t.co/ihokA6M41gSent a letter to President Trump urging his administration to stop this inhumane practice of separating children from their families at the border. Also filed legislation to ban the practice altogether. https://t.co/XvDVNJzUzfNet neutrality protections will be eliminated in 4 days.

That’s why @marcorubio and I introduced a resolution today supporting the United Bid. https://t.co/dibmMRwP1KJust introduced new legislation to prevent the Trump admin. from opening up any new areas off of FL's Gulf Coast to offshore oil drilling until at least 2027. Drilling off FL's coast poses a real risk to our state and it’s a risk we shouldn’t have to take. https://t.co/Wyb3DXC51f https://t.co/hkTku7ZX1WAccording to @NOAA, the U.S. just experienced the warmest May ever on record. It's not an exaggeration to say that climate change and sea level rise have already impacted our lives - it's reality.

Like us, Big Oil doesn’t believe Florida is really “off the table” to new drilling – despite what Scott and the Trump Administration keep saying – and now they are making a new push to drill closer to Florida’s shores. We can’t let that happen! https://t.co/s9gDhYh0q5So proud of @FSU_Softball – way to go Noles! 

https://t.co/9mIzjbmpnhFlorida’s citrus industry is a vital part of our economy. But if we don’t find a cure to citrus greening soon, we won’t be growing oranges in Florida much longer.

Here’s the letter I just sent to Secretary Zinke: https://t.co/hzFoItAgJzThis is just one more reason why the U.S. needs to keep the pressure on Maduro’s criminal regime – we must help the Venezuelan people restore their democracy and stop these atrocities. https://t.co/d2nya8q1R3This administration’s unbelievable policies are ripping families apart. We must return to our true American values by treating those seeking asylum with dignity and respect and keeping families together. https://t.co/FrOHfmGoDvHow do you miss over 4,000 deaths?

They can search the records, but only by hand. That’s ridiculous. I filed a bill today to change that &amp; help them solve crimes quicker.It was great talking with @davidhogg111 and @charlie_mirsky this week about the steps we can take to make our communities safer and protect them from gun violence. https://t.co/BO6FLjxgXrNOAA predicts 10 – 16 named storms this hurricane season. And this disturbance heading into the Gulf could be the first. If you’re in Florida, please be sure to keep an eye on this storm and heed any warnings from local officials. We are monitoring closely. https://t.co/bg2DwzEBjgThe cancellation of this summit reveals the lack of preparation on the part of President Trump in dealing with a totalitarian dictator like Kim Jong Un. We’ve seen similar lack of preparation by the president in dealing with the leaders of China and Russia.We know Russia interfered in our elections two years ago and if we don’t act now, they could interfere in the elections coming up. But the state of Florida hasn’t taken any of the federal funding available to them to improve election security. That just doesn’t make sense.In March, Congress passed a bill that authorized $19 million to help Florida election officials strengthen their security and update equipment. At least 12 other states have applied for and received funding, but the state of FL hasn’t even applied for one single dollar. Not one. https://t.co/WkVu2KzId6We still don’t know the cause of the FIU bridge collapse, but it’s reassuring that the NTSB is laser-focused on the cracks in the structure. The victims’ families and the public deserve a thorough examination of this tragic event to prevent it from ever happening again. https://t.co/OW1ODyZZeAThe state of Florida’s refusal to expand Medicaid coverage to 800,000 Floridians is unconscionable. Their decision not to act means $66 billion of Florida taxpayer dollars are going elsewhere, while Floridians go without coverage. https://t.co/wqS09BVuqlWe can’t allow what happened in Parkland and in Texas to become the new normal in this country. I just announced that I will be filing new legislation to hire more mental health professionals at schools across the country to ensure any student who needs help is able to get it. https://t.co/SaWLRRlD1BThe administration is taking some steps to prevent Maduro’s cronies from profiting on the sale of state assets – but we shouldn’t stop there. The U.S. should prohibit the importation of Venezuelan oil until constitutional order there has been restored.The president has been bluff and bluster on trade - now it appears China has gotten the best of him. No advance on trying to stop unfair trade with China.To all the brave men and women who are serving, or who have served, in our nation’s armed forces: Thank you from a fellow vet #ArmedForcesDayTomorrow’s snap election in Venezuela is nothing more than Maduro’s desperate attempt to cling to power. The U.S. can and MUST do more to help the Venezuelan people restore their democracy – and bring Josh Holt home.Black women are three times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth as white women.

It’s a step in the right direction, and very much needed in this community.Without meaningful support for affordable housing at all levels of government, we risk condemning a whole lot of Americans and Floridians to a life of distress and despair.Over the years, the state government in Florida has siphoned money away from trust funds designed to increase the supply of affordable housing—using that that money instead for other purposes. That’s shortsighted and it hurts hardworking Floridians.Now, Florida is experiencing an influx of people coming from Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria, inflaming an already troubled affordable housing problem — a problem compounded by mistakes made at the state level.In Florida, around 7 in 10 of low-income renters pay more than 40% of their income to rent. To make matters worse, the growth of low-income renters in Florida has far outpaced the creation of new affordable housing units. https://t.co/Tar2W5Y3pOThe less affordable housing gets, the more unstable our communities become. In fact, studies show unstable housing conditions lead to health risks, higher rates of crime, poor academic performance, psychological costs, and the loss of community.For too long, affordable housing has been treated like a luxury, rather than a basic need. When folks can’t afford to stay in their home, they’re forced to choose between food, medicine, and a roof over their head. No one in Florida should have to make that kind of choice.It’s a great day for seniors In Melbourne! Cutting the ribbon today at a newly-renovated affordable housing complex to help provide housing to seniors on a tight budget. https://t.co/yXOv9Ow8DNThe RESTORE Act is working as intended: Escambia County just received $1.6 million to help make water quality improvements and Bay County just received funding for a new boat ramp. Proud to have sponsored this bill with Sen. Mary Landrieu to help us recover from the BP oil spill.Each and every veteran here today has done their part to serve our country, and I’m going to make sure our country does its part to serve them.And that’s why, together with Sen. Rubio and @SenJackReed, we’re working to enact legislation to help reduce veteran homelessness here in Florida and across our country.That’s why, together with @SenJackReed, we’ve introduced legislation to require the @DeptofDefense to provide the full details of any and all chemical and biological tests that our soldiers may have been exposed to while serving abroad, including in areas such as Vietnam.These brave warriors put their lives on the line to defend our country. And I believe we, as a nation, have a responsibility to provide them the very best care when they return home.One of the greatest honors I have serving as senator is getting to meet some of the brave men and women who have served in our nation’s military. Their strength, courage and dedication to our country never ceases to amaze me.Great to be here at the Orlando VA Medical Center at Lake Nona with @SenJackReed, touring the facilities and honoring local veterans on the 50th anniversary year of their service in Vietnam. #VietnamWarVeteransDay https://t.co/HpRhPFWYBuGreat to be here in Fort Lauderdale today after the congressional delegation was able to secure federal funding to build a new federal courthouse.

This is an increase over the previous year, where for every 1,000 newborns, 11 are born suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.Great roundtable in Tampa, hearing from students and administrators about how we can keep our schools safe from gun violence.

I joined them in calling on Congress to take action to make our communities safer. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/EVLCXOSGebWe must do everything we can to make sure tragedies like what we saw at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Sandy Hook, and Columbine never happen again. #NeverAgainI’m hopeful we can continue to work together on a universal background check requirement for anyone who wants to buy a gun and find a way to get these assault weapons and high-capacity magazines off our streets.We’ve shown how we can get things done to prevent gun violence – if we just work together. The fight doesn’t stop here – we need to do more if we really want to reduce the gun violence problem in our country.This includes the Fix NICS Act, which strengthens our background check system, the STOP School Violence Act, which funds programs to help keep our schools safe, and finally we can let @CDCgov do the necessary research on gun violence.With this spending bill, we’re moving a little closer to turning the voices of the students marching across the country into action. While we still have so much work to do, I am happy to see some movement on bipartisan legislation to help address gun violence in our country.Since Columbine, more than 187,000 students have been exposed to gun violence at school. When are we going to say enough is enough? https://t.co/QEuD9hftn6 #NeverAgainThis Saturday, students will lead marches across our country to demand action and pass commonsense gun safety legislation. They just want our schools and communities to be safe. That is certainly not too much to ask, we owe it to them to get something done. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/2mTVx1OMQKJoined courageous freedom fighters @RosaMariaPaya, @cocofarinas, @PatrideCeballos, and @RJaureguiA to discuss why we need to keep up the pressure on the brutal Castro and Maduro regimes, and excited we saved funding for democracy programs in Cuba and Venezuela from proposed cuts! https://t.co/t9ZuGMkKAzThrilled to announce that @NASAKennedy is in line for a huge boost to modernize its launch facilities! Not only could it create hundreds of jobs, it will help us get to Mars quicker and safer. https://t.co/t7zn5LJarnThis spending package is great news for Florida! It includes funding to protect the Everglades and repair the Hoover dike, a new Hurricane Hunter jet, funding to fight citrus greening and the opioid epidemic, and key steps to address gun violence. https://t.co/8TjXdjBDRjJust learned that funding for another Hurricane Hunter jet is in the $1.3 trillion spending bill Congress will vote on this week. I've been relentless on this because 20 million Floridians are in the potential path of a hurricane &amp; data from this aircraft saves lives &amp; property.Thank you @RosaMariaPaya, for speaking out against the abuses of the Castro regime. Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at @freedomhouse! https://t.co/iydRU4XacAGreat to see that fellow Floridian @CarltonWard held a @NatGeoMuseum talk in DC last night. His stunning photography does a great job highlighting the critical conservation issues facing our state. Protecting Florida means protecting the habitat our unique wildlife depend on. https://t.co/3KnHerT1hQNTSB chairman just told me they’re leaving no stone unturned in its probe of the FIU bridge collapse. Here’s the latest: https://t.co/3fEzlv2YLOThe Senate just passed legislation to crack down on online sex trafficking. An untold number of women and children in Florida and across the U.S. are being sold into sexual slavery via the internet. It’s unacceptable and wrong. We can't sit by idly any longer. https://t.co/Cs46Z5t3lzMore evidence that Russia is propping up Maduro and his cronies while the Venezuelan people suffer. We must show Putin and Maduro that we will not tolerate this behavior. https://t.co/95JsYCuY6iMet with @HispanicFed this afternoon, six months to the day after Hurricane Maria tore a path of destruction across Puerto Rico. It is totally unacceptable that more than 100,000 people are still without electricity. They're our fellow American citizens! https://t.co/1U9o45OOl5Mr. Brangman’s presence at today’s hearing is a stark reminder of the human cost of these defective airbags and a reminder to everyone – especially @NHTSAgov — that we need to pick up the pace on these recalls before anyone else loses a loved one. https://t.co/bdkjd50W4UIn 2014, we held our first hearing on defective Takata airbags, and more than three years later, there are still too many of these deadly airbags on our roads. We need to get these recalls moving, lives are at stake.FEMA is too slow in Puerto Rico. And if you did not have electricity 6 months after the storm, you'd be upset. https://t.co/iYz7KI7QxKNearly 6 months after Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, lives are on the line as more than hundred thousand people are still without electricity. As hurricane season approaches, our fellow American citizens desperately need help. https://t.co/kKlG2Ci54tI’m joining my colleagues to ask why the Army Corps of Engineers is drawing down the number of utility repair workers in Puerto Rico, despite many still without power in Caguas, Vieques, and elsewhere. https://t.co/MQRhG3SzxzGlad to see the administration heeded my warning last week about the need to crack down on the criminal Maduro regime’s use of cryptocurrency. Maduro must not be allowed to circumvent U.S. sanctions. https://t.co/yleJ2yzq0yThe Mueller investigation must not be impeded or obstructed in any way. The American people deserve to see this through to its conclusion.The manatees need our help. We must do more to protect these gentle giants that grace Florida’s waters, which is why I've filed legislation to get @USFWS to help ensure we protect these magnificent creatures. https://t.co/nHBMLBFFOx https://t.co/mlTRhvaE3QThe first #StPatricksDay was not in Boston in 1737, nor was the first St. Patrick's Day parade in New York in 1762. It was just discovered that the first St. Patrick's Day in the New World was celebrated by an Irish priest in St. Augustine, Florida in 1600, with a parade in 1601. https://t.co/YGESZzuHKPThis week I asked my colleagues to take up legislation immediately to treat gun violence as the public health crisis that it is and fund the necessary research at the CDC. Gun violence is hurting our communities -- we need to take meaningful action and this is an important step. https://t.co/dx3hOqSiI7Just asked @USDOT to turn over records related to the engineering, design, construction, safety and inspection of the bridge that collapsed yesterday at @FIU. We need a clear understanding of who had what role in this tragedy and hold them accountable. https://t.co/Qb8DzAoyisGreat news for Florida! Not only will this strengthen our national security, it will be a boost to the central Florida economy! https://t.co/pnI2ExPw58My condolences go out to Lt. Caleb Nathaniel King’s and Lt. Cmdr. James Brice Johnson’s families and the entire @USNavy. I’ve asked the Navy to investigate the cause of the crash immediately. https://t.co/hcZ2NkNuZnAgree with Marjory Stoneman Douglas student @Emma4Change, arming teachers is a really bad idea. https://t.co/SiIgQ0DQgvGreat meeting with the next @USCG Commandant, Vice Admiral Karl Schultz this week. Thankful for the brave men and women of the Coast Guard for assisting nearly 38,000 people last year alone, including almost 12,000 people during hurricane season. Semper Paratus. https://t.co/JGgPD5rm07Just talked to @NTSB Chairman Sumwalt who confirmed he’ll be launching and leading an investigation into the bridge collapse at @FIU.My heart goes out to the victims and the families affected by this tragic bridge collapse at @FIU.@iamsharpe @FIU I asked Sec. of Transportation Chao to start an immediate investigation and assist the university as it is going through this tough time.Just spoke with the President of @FIU, Mark Rosenberg, regarding the collapsed pedestrian bridge and offered to help in any way I can and I'm calling Sec. of Transportation Chao to ask the NTSB to investigate what went wrong. https://t.co/hnFYiesOTpIt’s becoming clear that no one really knows what offshore drilling deal Secretary Zinke cut with the governor of Florida, including Zinke himself. More and more, it’s beginning to sound like no deal really exists and, as feared, it’s all one big political sleight of hand. https://t.co/tQybDsLokeWhy did it take the Trump administration so long to impose any sanctions at all on Russia? Eight months ago, Congress passed legislation to impose sanctions by an overwhelming vote. This should have been done months ago and we still have work to do to hold Putin accountable. https://t.co/eaa3JY25EVArming teachers is a terrible idea.
https://t.co/co5LjqMv3fLet’s keep building on this momentum. We can create the change we seek, we just have to keep at it. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/4eGXPy7dUQKeep on marching and keep on speaking out. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/DbJW3f5rqlMet with @leagueofcities this morning about expanding broadband internet access, restoring voting rights to folks who have done their time, making our cities safer through commonsense gun safety measures, and how investing in infrastructure moves everyone forward together. https://t.co/HY2BcD0c6hJoined the students protesting out front of the Capitol today. So much energy and determination in these kids. They’re counting on us to act and we can’t let them down. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/1pEINKjBlsSaddened at the loss of a brilliant man who overcame impossible odds to help us understand the mysteries of the cosmos. https://t.co/N9DfYFqP9MThese students continue to amaze and inspire us. Now, we must turn their voices into action. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/zNLIXv0o2NStanding with all the high school students in Florida and around the country on #NationalWalkoutDay who are demanding action to make sure the gun violence that we saw in Parkland never happens again. #NeverAgain https://t.co/e3lgLUNHfDWe must accept the reality that the climate is changing. Not only must we recognize this reality, we must take action. #TimeToWakeUpFact: Seas are rising. https://t.co/jHQfB2X2fnFact: Sea surface temperatures are rising. https://t.co/VlmRCRvZadFact: Global surface temperatures are rising. https://t.co/7kZHVgNDBkFacts are facts, and they’re not up for debate. Here are some climate facts that we just can’t ignore:.@NASA recently released climate data showing that 2017 was the second-hottest year on record after 2016, and now 17 of the 18 warmest years since record keeping began have occurred since 2001. https://t.co/rtJdzq5Bjy https://t.co/EKwHNw8LdPClimate change also threatens our national security. The Dept. of National Intelligence's new Worldwide Threat Assessment states that climate change and threats to our environment are "likely to fuel economic and social discontent -and possibly upheaval." https://t.co/UCGpLNXcgvA new report is also sounding the alarm that sea turtles are already feeling the effects of climate change. Almost all sea turtles being born now are female.
https://t.co/lx4r388KK6While some want to deny the reality of climate change, or that it is some far off problem for future generations to address, doctors in Florida are sounding the alarm to the public health risk it is posing today, right now. https://t.co/72eEhbDqzbClimate change is real, and we must take action to protect ourselves. Denial of this scientific reality is simply not an option, especially in Florida.From the rising seas that flood our cities, to bleached coral and more frequent and ferocious hurricanes, we must take action to combat climate change now. The longer we put it off, the harder it will be to protect ourselves. https://t.co/FCMAF6mcUNJust joined @SenWhitehouse and a group of my colleagues on the Senate floor to urge action to combat climate change. We can't sleep on this issue, it's #TimeToWakeUp to the threats of climate change.Is Florida on or off the table when it comes to offshore drilling? Depends on the day, it seems. Sec. Zinke just admitted in front of a Senate committee that Florida is "still in the process," confirming his previous announcement was a political stunt. https://t.co/8kKDvq7m68 https://t.co/M3tESIJFHuThere is chaos in the Trump administration’s Department of State. Now Secretary Tillerson is gone, and an undersecretary just got fired. It's time to clamp down and become professional in our foreign relations. https://t.co/c0JHyVcScIThere are many pieces of bipartisan legislation I’m supporting as first steps, but none have come to a vote. We need to get something done. And if we’re serious about stopping gun violence, we need to get assault rifles off our streets and require universal background checks. https://t.co/oQn3u6PRURArming teachers is a terrible idea. It’s not what the students want, it’s not what the teachers want, it’s not what law enforcement wants, and it’s not what the American people want. https://t.co/wnxlMI021yGreat meeting with the Florida delegation of @JDRF today. These bright kids caught me up to speed on the technological breakthroughs being made in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes, like the artificial pancreas. We must continue funding these programs, so we can find a cure. https://t.co/eYAqgu1VSXJust sent a letter to Sec. Mnuchin to ask what steps @USTreasury is taking to ensure that the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela, which is responsible for numerous human rights violations, cannot undermine sanctions through the use of cryptocurrencies. https://t.co/0TupFjqRxfThe answer to protecting our kids and communities is not more guns in our schools or arming teachers. That's a terrible idea. We should be focused on expanding background checks and getting these military-style assault rifles off the streets.Florida’s waterways should stay clean and clear of toxic chemicals. That’s why @RepTedDeutch and I asked the EPA to make sure there’s public input. And they need to take public health into account, especially for our children and seniors. https://t.co/aoGJvZYBrMSea turtle nesting season is upon us! Help protect these spectacular creatures by leaving your flashlights at home if you're on the beach at night, keep an eye out for posted signs about sea turtle nests nearby, and as always, keep our beaches clean. https://t.co/6vfDCfScHJ https://t.co/3fqKwHX32XMany residents of Immokalee walk or bike to work and school, but unfortunately a lot of the roads do not have sidewalks or streetlights, making it dangerous. Great working with local leaders to help secure funding to make Immokalee safer &amp; more accessible. https://t.co/FTR6ISjq58Today marks 11 years since Bob Levinson disappeared while working in Iran. We've got to keep up the pressure on Iran to help bring Bob home, and I urge the Senate to take up legislation I've sponsored to punish those involved in taking Americans hostage. https://t.co/TiaBsOrm7gHelp #ProtectOurCoast from offshore drilling by submitting a public comment opposing @Interior’s reckless plan that threatens our state. The public comment period closes tonight; speak out now to help protect our beautiful beaches: https://t.co/LdZ9q7kPSy https://t.co/IQ5t6UW11fBefore the comment period closes tonight, I just sent another letter to @SecretaryZinke to stress the importance of not allowing oil drilling off Florida’s coast. In addition to the economic and environmental risks, it poses a direct threat to our national security interests. https://t.co/k6VRHHUNBqCongratulations to Vasundara Govindarajan, an incredibly talented 8th-grader who won her 4th Miami-Dade Spelling Bee in a row and is now headed to compete in the National Spelling Bee! The future is bright with young women like Vasundara leading the way. https://t.co/GkQ00Jt7on@SenCortezMasto I've met so many courageous young women speaking out following the tragedy in Parkland, Florida. Students like @Emma4Change, @JaclynCorin, @delaneytarr, and so many others I've met over the last few weeks make me so hopeful for the future of our country. #InternationalWomensDay@SenCortezMasto An important sign of progress in recognizing the important role that women have had in Florida is the passage of legislation paving the way for civil rights icon Mary McLeod Bethune to be honored with a statue and represent Florida in the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/AS2uSXqjIhToday, I’m cosponsoring a Senate Resolution introduced by @SenCortezMasto that recognizes the contributions of Hispanic women to the United States and the work that still needs to be done to ensure Hispanic women have the same opportunities as their male counterparts.Since my first days in the Florida House, I've fought to protect women and make sure they're treated equally under the law and continue that fight in the U.S. Senate today.Women make our communities strong, and I’ll tell you I’m not sure what I would do without my wife Grace as my full partner. I’m in awe of her dedication to give back to the community every chance she gets. https://t.co/r403pre2V4Today is #InternationalWomensDay! Women across the world, the nation, and the state of Florida are a critical part in making the world a better place. We must always fight to ensure women are treated equally, because we all benefit when everyone gets the respect they deserve.Florida is growing by a thousand people a day and desperately needs infrastructure improvements. You can’t toll your way out this problem, so I've joined my colleagues to develop a plan that works. Read our plan here: https://t.co/JopCw8NSyQ https://t.co/Gmete8CXljWATCH LIVE: Join us as we hear testimony from Marjory Stoneman Douglas student @davidhogg111, @fred_guttenberg, and others affected by gun violence who are demanding action to protect our communities. https://t.co/30pbr3SEUe #AmericaSpeaksOutJoin @SenStabenow and I at 4PM ET as we host a hearing today with Marjory Stoneman Douglas student @davidhogg111, @fred_guttenberg, and others affected by gun violence who are demanding action to protect our communities. We will be streaming the hearing live. #AmericaSpeaksOut https://t.co/tl8tp8f6ILEnjoyed speaking at the @OceanLeadership forum today. I discussed how the Deepwater Horizon disaster forever changed our state, what we learned from it &amp; how legislation like the RESTORE Act can secure funding to advance ocean science and technology that benefits us all. #PPF2018 https://t.co/5Uz0XbQ9MGFEMA is currently providing shelter to more than a thousand families in Florida who fled their homes after Hurricane Irma. This program expires in just a few days, and I hope the state of Florida and FEMA work together on an extension so these families can get the help they need.Russia’s cyber operations are an attack on the very foundation of our democracy, and we ought to start defending ourselves. Until the Trump administration takes action, Vladimir Putin is going to continue to get away with this. https://t.co/nnubpwMgsRCitrus growers in Florida are hurting after their groves were devastated by Hurricane Irma, and the disaster assistance they need has yet to arrive. Talked with Sec. Perdue at USDA about speeding up this process, and he said help will arrive within weeks, not months.Always great meeting with the hardworking and courageous firefighters that risk their lives to keep Floridians safe. From supporting research into cancers that affect too many firefighters to working to make healthcare more affordable, I've got their back. https://t.co/JF89lKDpdjWhat happened in Parkland must never happen again and this bill, like many other bipartisan proposals I’ve supported, is a commonsense measure that helps advance the conversation and congressional efforts around school safety and comprehensive gun reform. https://t.co/4MgBx6BToTIt's been nearly six months since Hurricane Irma hit Florida, and almost a month after Congress passed the disaster funding to help Florida's fisheries, citrus growers and communities across the state. They're still waiting to get the help they need, which is simply unacceptable. https://t.co/ZzmDFK0qvcJust called Commerce Sec. Ross and urged him to help get the NOAA disaster funding provided by Congress to areas of Florida still recovering from Hurricane Irma. Our fishermen need help, and debris still litters the canals and is threatening to damage coral. https://t.co/xWqTb3y0LOJust signed onto a bill to require the FBI to notify state law enforcement within 24 hours if someone who fails a background check tries to buy a gun. https://t.co/wCh475AGFLThese military-style assault rifles inflict such severe damage, they should be relegated to the battlefield. They simply don’t belong on our streets. https://t.co/FEOv1CLwn9Happy Birthday, Florida! It's an incredible privilege to represent the people of this great state in the U.S. Senate. https://t.co/YRCztc1oWdMet with a group of local teachers and school administrators in Tallahassee today to hear from them and discuss what needs to be done to make sure another tragedy like the one we saw at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High never happens again. #NeverAgain https://t.co/mEmEgL6bcFGreat talking with @JoeNBC this morning on @Morning_Joe about what we need to do to enact commonsense measures to combat this epidemic of gun violence. In order to solve this problem, we’ve got to bring people together – not divide people. https://t.co/KtYEm4xwxEVladimir Putin is no friend of the United States. He's an old soviet-style KGB officer who is trying to use this video as an intimidation tactic. And until the Trump administration starts cracking down on Russia, Putin is going to keep getting away with this. https://t.co/JBKCUO4iMGArming teachers is NOT the answer. https://t.co/2bZq7kJNn3Massacres like this shouldn't happen in a school, in a nightclub, in a church, or at a concert. It shouldn't happen at all. So, why does it? Our refusal to act. We can’t let what happened fade into a memory like so many other tragedies. Let's do the right thing and take action. https://t.co/Ss4KEXmDI4Thinking of everyone at Marjory Stoneman Douglas as they return to school today. Your courage and determination in wake of this tragedy has been tremendous; and we are all with you as you return to class today. #NeverAgainGreat talking with members of Disabled American Veterans today to discuss how we can improve the quality of care we are providing our veterans when they return home from the battlefield. https://t.co/Ymz8Kh0tv1It’s time for us to come together – not as Republicans or Democrats, but as human beings – to enact commonsense gun safety measures to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/gpqkYC1vWaMet with some courageous young students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School visiting D.C. today. Their hope gives me hope. Their determination gives me determination. We need to do everything we can to make sure another tragedy like this never happens again. #NeverAgain https://t.co/6EDIucfTs2Powerful words from one of the doctors who treated some of the victims of the Parkland school shooting on why we need to get these military-style assault rifles off our streets. https://t.co/m1ZeGkHdr5
