That is intolerable in a free and democratic society.Family separation cannot be replaced by family incarceration&amp;imprisonment.Ending family separation would be a welcome&amp;humane step, but the solution cannot be the immoral&amp;unlawful detention of children.

Look at the facts.The more President Trump tries to use tomorrow’s report to claim FBI bias, the more ridiculous his supposed justification for firing FBI Director Jim Comey looks. (As if it ever passed the laugh test to begin with.) He said it himself: it was “this Russia thing.”President Trump’s allies will try to convince the American public somehow that the FBI’s decision to release information about the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server but hide what they knew about his ties to Russia…somehow makes him the victim? What?!I’m calling it now: no matter what the DOJ IG report actually says, President Trump’s sycophantic supporters will try to claim that somehow he is the victim of FBI wrongdoing&amp;bias. Talk about fake news.Spoiler alert: President Trump’s cronies have already readied their talking points to exaggerate&amp;distort the facts of tomorrow’s DOJ IG report and spin them into a false narrative about the Special Counsel investigation.Special Counsel filing asserting that Russia will interfere in this year’s midterm elections backs up what we’ve been hearing from U.S. intelligence for months: the Russians attacked our democracy in 2016&amp;they’ll do it again in 2018 unless we take immediate action to prevent it.Today, the DOJ told me “we have to find ways to raise costs of malicious and malign behavior by foreign states” when I asked about Russian interference in the 2018 midterms. I agree: the Russians need to pay a price for past meddling to prevent future attacks on our democracy.Filing today by Special Counsel seeks to protect investigation against possible continuing Russian interference. Judiciary Committee witnesses conceded it will happen, if Russians pay no price. https://t.co/ZB6r0wtoSFThe new Trump Administration policy making it nearly impossible for victims of domestic&amp;gang violence to seek asylum is hideous, noxious, and a betrayal of American values.

It's unthinkable in this great country, and already legally indisputable.That statement was short, but it sure wasn’t accurate - it was a lie meant to cover up the truth about meetings between President Trump’s top campaign advisers and Russian operatives peddling damaging information about his political opponent.After months of denials, stunningly clear admission that President Trump dictated the misleading statement his son gave about meeting w/Russian agents during the campaign.The President’s lawyers contend that having him testify “demeans the office.” No. This President’s actions demean the office, and this absurd assertion demeans our entire system of law.Special Counsel cannot be dissuaded or deterred from subpoenaing President Trump by lawyers' fallacious, farcical memo. Uncover the truth. Follow the facts and law.The legal assertions in this document are no longer laughable - they are terrifying to anyone who believes in the rule of law.President Trump’s lawyers cite out-of-date statutes, magical legal thinking&amp;unconstitutional assumptions, but ignore this core truth: no one is above the law.Donald in Wonderland: through a legal looking glass, no President can be prosecuted because whatever he says is the law. Too absurd even for fiction. In fact, no one is above the law.Republicans colleagues must join in sounding the alarm, loud&amp;clear.

What don’t we know?What is the Foreign Emoluments Clause? Before the President receives any gifts, payments, or benefits from foreign governments he must first receive the consent of Congress. Pretty simple, right? Not for this President.President Trump has repeatedly&amp;flagrantly violated the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause. He has thumbed his nose at its plain text, and in doing so, thumbed his nose at the American people as well.One week out from oral arguments in our case to compel the President to obey the Constitution of the United States.

It is not the strategy we need to stop the Iranian regime's malign agenda.Great to welcome @RideOnTeam26 as their rolling rally from #Newtown arrives in Washington.

He's on the wrong side of history, and the wrong side of the American people.Regardless of Trump's pandering to the NRA, young people are championing a new social change movement to end gun violence - sweeping the nation and saying "our blood, your hands."Pres. Trump squandered a golden opportunity to call for commonsense solutions to the gun violence ravaging America – instead trotting out more tired talking points and appalling excuses. This is what moral bankruptcy looks like.While Pres. Trump doubles down to the NRA, we redouble our fight for commonsense reforms - universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders &amp; bans on assault weapons/high-capacity magazines.Pres. Trump would rather stand with the NRA - and cheer Congressional complicity in gun violence - than survivors &amp; loved ones demanding action. His fatal fidelity to the gun lobby is despicable.After chastising fellow Republicans for fearing the NRA, Pres. Trump parrots their tired talking points to rapturous applause. A profile in cowardice that should outrage every American.If Pres. Trump truly wanted to confront gun violence, he'd use his NRA address to call for the commonsense reforms Americans want to see.

Senate must pass Judiciary Committee bill to #ProtectMueller and ensure his vital work continues.Last week, a bipartisan Judiciary Committee majority cleared bill to #ProtectMueller - rightfully putting rule of law above politics.

I’ll withhold my judgment on Jackson, but Americans are right to question this Administration’s failure to fulfill a basic obligation.Yet again, this Administration fails to fully vet a nominee of enormous importance. This troubling pattern insults the American public and undermines faith in our nation’s most vital institutions. https://t.co/Yzkp88j0UAQuestions surrounding Jackson only deepen doubt about his ability to lead our government’s second largest department – one of profound significance to millions of veterans &amp; families.Serious, swirling questions about Jackson underscore the Trump Administration’s abject and repeated failure to properly vet nominees – a tremendous disservice to veterans and all Americans.On this day 31 years ago, the L’Ambiance Plaza disaster in #Bridgeport claimed 28 lives and forever changed many more.

His regressive views on reproductive rights jeopardize women’s healthcare around the world. These are not the qualities we need in a Secretary of State.America needs a top diplomat who values diplomacy and knows how it's done. Mike Pompeo's record of prioritizing military might over constructive engagement shows he is not right for this job.On @Morning_Joe today, I discussed our historic obligation to protect the Special Counsel and why I’m opposing Mike Pompeo’s nomination as Secretary of State.

Turning our back on children &amp; families seeking refuge is a shameful affront to American values.An effective response to the crisis in Syria cannot just be a military one - what remains lacking are robust diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian efforts.Assad should be held accountable -  tried and convicted of war crimes. His Russian and Iranian enablers should be held responsible as well.A military response to Assad’s brutal use of chemical weapons was well-merited, but Pres. Trump must come to Congress and set forth a consistent strategic path forward.Syria strike still lacks a coherent strategy - sending a message without real effect on Assad’s war capability.Hope you’ll join me and FCC Commissioner @JRosenworcel in #EastHartford this Sunday (4/15) for a Town Hall on #NetNeutrality - the foundation of our free and open internet. https://t.co/CSH6jrxfLhThanks to everyone for joining today’s Town Hall discussion in #Meriden - and for continuing to raise your voices.

Zuckerberg needs to bring that approach to protecting consumer privacy.Facebook’s failure to protect users after being provided this app’s terms and conditions is strong evidence that the company recklessly violated FTC’s consent decree.Zuckerberg admitted at today’s hearing that no one on Facebook's app review team was held accountable for approving the app used to sell user data to Cambridge Analytica.

He should be prosecuted, in absentia if necessary.Humanitarian aid must be unfrozen - some of $200 million suspended by Trump - to aid Syrian victims of this heinous, inhumane chemical attack.If Pres. Trump truly wants to lead, he can start by standing up to Russia and ending the freeze he placed on $200 million in Syria relief funds Congress provided. https://t.co/5wWMyEwpkVWe cannot avert our eyes. Time to confront this horrific crisis with action to hold Assad - as well as Russian &amp; Iranian enablers - accountable for barbaric brutality.Time for real leadership from Trump. More than merely words, action is necessary to hold Russia, as well as Syria &amp; Iran, accountable. https://t.co/YqiKmkBUIgAt gun violence Town Halls across America, students are speaking out and showing the way to commonsense change.

FTC must show wronged consumers its mettle and seek meaningful monetary damages and other remedies. https://t.co/QRkLUpxLbVNext week’s Commerce/Judiciary joint hearing is a good first step toward instituting some vitally necessary rules of the road for Big Tech - something that can and ought to be a bipartisan priority.Glad Zuckerberg has agreed to face the music.

Its betrayal of trust, sabotaging privacy protection, squanders the coin of its realm.High noon for Facebook - and Big Tech. A reckoning moment for privacy protection. Whose side are they on?Facebook shamelessly shredded privacy rights through its failure to protect users. Rigorous rules of the road - vigorously enforced - are vital, now.
