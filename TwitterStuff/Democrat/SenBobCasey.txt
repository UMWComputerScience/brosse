The Senate should only consider this nomination when a new Senate is seated in January. https://t.co/O2Tz39U5eAStopping the assault on workers and labor unions in Congress, state legislatures and now the United States Supreme Court is vital to increasing incomes and strengthening the middle-class.If all workers benefit, it is only right that everyone contributes a fair share fee.  This effort in the courts was nothing more than a well-funded attempt by corporate billionaires to dismantle unions.If someone directly benefits from the negotiations by a union, it makes sense that they should pay a fee to cover the costs associated with this work and not get a free ride.By overturning 40 years of precedent, the U.S. Supreme Court is showing its opposition to the rights of working families and commonsense.Unions provide a path to the middle class for working people by increasing their income and the economic security of their families. To this end, it’s important that we do all we can to empower workers to organize, not make it harder. https://t.co/wCcUUe0VudWhat did corporate America do with that tax break?

I’m joining a new effort led by @RonWyden to demand one https://t.co/8FWeH6mrDUI am disturbed by what I saw on the video, and I have numerous questions about exactly what happened and why.

I grieve with them, and the communities of East Pittsburgh and the Woodland Hills School DistrictI’m joining an effort headed up by @SenJeffMerkley to call for Senate hearings on the Administration’s cruel treatment of migrant children. This isn’t over and there must be accountability and oversightSubstituting a lesser form of cruelty for a greater form is still crueltyDetaining families indefinitely, possibly in violation of the Flores Agreement, is not a valid alternativeHow can you claim your EO will end family separations when it does not explicitly prohibit them?Why would you want to modify this agreement when you already have authority to enforce the law and ensure children are kept safe and healthy?The Flores settlement agreement, which you intend to modify, simply requires that DHS meet basic child welfare standards and ensure children are held in the “least restrictive conditions” and released “without unnecessary delay.”Why are you using taxpayer money for this form of detention rather than looking to alternatives like the ICE Family Case Management Program (FCMP), which had a 99% court appearance rate for familiesYour EO states families will be kept together subject to the law and appropriations. According to the Center for American Progress, daily detention costs range from $126 to $182 per person, while alternatives range from $0.70 to $17 per dayFamily detention is bad for children. How will your EO ensure children are kept safe when DHS facilities do not meet basic child welfare standards? https://t.co/uy5GVMRt0hWhat steps are you taking NOW to ensure that every migrant child cruelly ripped away from their parents is reunited with them?Here are some questions I have for the Administration about the executive order (eo) and their current policyThe fight for justice for migrant children ripped away from their parents is not overThere are no excuses. Every child that was cruelly separated from their parents, from months-old babies to young teenagers, must be reunited with their families.The Administration has an obligation to ensure that children whose health has been adversely impacted by this policy receive appropriate medical services. Congress must demand that the Administration take steps to reunite every child that has been separated from their parents.This hellish policy was a choice and there must be a full measure of accountability for those officials who ordered it, defended it and carried it out.The Admin, aided by the complicity of extreme congressional Republicans, made a proactive decision to enact a policy that harmed children, told falsehoods about the origin &amp; scope of the policy &amp; for days held the fate of these kids hostage in order to extract policy concessions.These medical experts have said that the long-term impacts of this barbaric treatment could be lifelong health problems, such as heart disease and substance abuse disorders.Nearly 2,000 children have been subjected to what the American Academy of Pediatrics has called, ‘toxic stress’ and ‘amounts to child abuse.’Family detention is far from the only or best solution for the majority of families at the border. In addition, for thousands of children, the damage is already done.It is long overdue for President Trump to amend the most egregious element of his cruel and inhumane policy of ripping migrant children from their parents. But substituting a lesser form of cruelty for a greater form is still cruelty.We, as a country, are failing these kids.

I will fight like hell to protect Pennsylvania families and all Americans.They want to use the courts to enact the rest of their health care scheme—starting by allowing people to be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition and charging older Americans more for their health care.It is now abundantly clear that in passing a massive tax giveaway to the wealthy, Republicans also believe they signed into law permission for insurance companies to once again come after basic protections for the middle class.This suit is an outrageous assault by the Administration and congressional Republicans on older Americans, people with disabilities and the 52 million adults with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/K78VslQHiXWe also discussed my support for the AFG Program, legislation that would work to establish specialized national cancer registry for firefighters and my pending legislation that would restore and improve the deduction for union dues, which was suspended in the GOP tax bill.Last month, my Children of Fallen Heroes Act was signed into law, which establishes scholarships for children of first responders who lost their lives in the line of duty. https://t.co/PMykG45nUII’m grateful for the opportunity to hear from the brave men and women of the Chester FD and discuss my work on behalf of first responders. https://t.co/T8FKDHMFKvEach day, thousands of Pennsylvanians willingly put their lives on the line to keep us safe.

I urge my colleagues to reject this nomination.As a Senator representing more than 12 million Pennsylvanians, I refuse to be a rubber stamp for the extreme right.Instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to put mainstream individuals on the bench, this Administration and the Senate Majority Leader are demanding that the Senate confirm judicial nominees who advocate a hard-right ideology to appease their corporate donors.I have worked in good faith to move forward mainstream nominees whose judicial philosophy I disagreed with, including this Administration’s nominee for a Third Circuit seat in Philadelphia.My bipartisan work to recommend highly qualified individuals to the federal bench, both Republicans and Democrats, including five individuals nominated to the District Court in Pennsylvania by this Administration, is second to none.He has also praised a ruling that sought to overturn portions of the Violence Against Women Act. Our courts must be guardians of civil rights, of our values and of basic protections for workers.His published works reveal an ideology that will serve only the wealthy and powerful as opposed to protecting the rights of all Americans. Mr. Porter has argued against the Constitution’s Commerce Clause, which has guaranteed civil rights protections to millions of Americans.David Porter has no judicial experience so one of the only ways to assess his fitness for the second highest court in the nation, the U.S. Court of Appeals, is through his writings.https://t.co/Df0dUmCee4The @NAACP oppose the nomination of Mr. Porter. https://t.co/gKTZzBX3rzThe @civilrightsorg oppose the nomination of Mr. Porter. https://t.co/D8dAn3bb4MThe @NCJW oppose the nomination of Mr. Porter. https://t.co/nBJ0n47HC0The @Peoplefor the American Away oppose the nomination of Mr. Porter. https://t.co/ArYzlbLGLBThe @LCVoters opposes Mr. Porter's nomination. https://t.co/gMCRfeQGqoI refused to submit this blue slip because Mr. Porter has demonstrated a far-right ideology that will serve only the wealthy and powerful as opposed to protecting the rights of all Americans. https://t.co/UwKVRBvbsOThe Senate blue slip process for judicial nominees dates back to 1917.

That means we have less than two hours left to convince one more Senator to help us #SaveTheInternet.The White House should stop blocking the release of this health study. People in Bucks and Montgomery Counties, as well as areas across the country, deserve to know the health risks their families have been exposed to. https://t.co/H9H3yeyY9XWishing Pennsylvanians observing Ramadan a peaceful and blessed holy month.I have signed this letter as well. @realDonaldTrump should be fighting for PA jobs and wages- not putting China first. https://t.co/SIStXacBmOI am proud that the Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act was signed into law in March. I introduced this bill to help children of fallen law enforcement officers and first responders afford college by making them eligible for the maximum Pell Grant.We in Congress must continue to champion policies to keep officers safe, while also providing support for the families of the fallen.During Police Week, as we remember the men and women who have lost their lives in the line of duty, my thoughts are with their families and loved ones who have sacrificed alongside them. #PoliceWeekWe discussed my efforts to combat the lack of investment in our Commonwealth’s children and to hear more about the ongoing burdens facing middle class working families. https://t.co/WocQ5ujwqNJoined by County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and State Representative Jake Wheatley, I convened a roundtable with local families, health care advocates and child care professionals in Pittsburgh. https://t.co/NrRnkbnEyHWith Mother’s Day approaching, the Trump Administration still has not fulfilled its promises on child care and has proposed new rescissions to CHIP. https://t.co/omMgaV3tYAFamilies across Pennsylvania struggle with the cost of health care and child care, forcing many parents to choose between going to work and paying for their children’s care. https://t.co/w916S3PzfhThe bill would assist farmers and ranchers by reimbursing them for the costs to produce, harvest, pack, process, store or transport to foodbanks food that is safe for consumption but does not have access to a retail market or supply chain.Just introduced the Farm to Food Bank Act. This legislation is designed to establish food recovery networks in each state to incentivize farmers to donate their product directly to food banks to be distributed to those in need. https://t.co/MPgcjoP0kfWe have 50, we need just #oneMoreVote to pass the Senate resolution to save #NetNeutrality https://t.co/U83SGnRXL1Today we’re filing a petition to force a vote to save #NetNeutrality We need just one more vote, are your senators on this list? https://t.co/keHftsWtoyBy taking a step that violates the JCPOA, President Trump has taken a drastic step that will increase the possibility of Iran resuming its pursuit of a nuclear weapon and make it much more difficult to reach a diplomatic agreement to constrain North Korea’s nuclear program.Pursuant to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, the Administration is required to report to Congress if there is a breach of the deal. That has not yet happened.I have also worked to ensure full verification and enforcement of the Iran nuclear agreement and strongly counter their non-nuclear destabilizing actions.I supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) because it was the best available option to substantially constrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions and to improve oversight of their technology.In the Senate, I led efforts to sanction and hold the Iranian regime accountable for its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, its development of ballistic missiles and its support for terrorist proxies.In testimony before Congress in April 2018, Secretary Mattis specifically referred to the intrusive nature of our ability to examine Iran’s nuclear capabilities.On October 3, 2017, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis spoke about the agreement and said, “I believe, at this point in time, absent indications to the contrary, it is something the President should consider staying with."This Administration’s national security leadership has repeatedly confirmed this.U.S. military officials, past and present, have said that Iran is complying with the nuclear agreement and that it is in the best national security interest of our nation to keep it in place.I strongly disagree with the President’s decision to end U.S. participation in an agreement that constrains Iran’s nuclear program and helps prevent the regime from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability.This is absolutely unacceptable. I will continue to fight for CHIP funding, and I hope Republicans will join me.This proposal is a shameful betrayal of children. This Administration and congressional Republicans passed a massive tax giveaway to their donors and big corporations, and now they want vulnerable children to pay for it. https://t.co/3PSIE4vYUpThey represent America's future and the racists who attacked them don't. I urge @realDonaldTrump to send a powerful message and use his platform to denounce the attacks on these bright young minds.Mikayla Sharrieff, India Skinner and Bria Snell are an inspiration to our nation. We, as a country, should draw inspiration from and celebrate these self described “Hidden figures in the making.” https://t.co/oqFtUemBPeToday, @RepDwightEvans and I convened a listening session to discuss ways we can achieve these goals. https://t.co/9NUwnMeLmZI want to work closely with farmers, advocates, and stakeholders to insure that this bill benefits not only Pennsylvania’s farmers, but also continues to support those who participate in critical nutrition assistance programs, such as SNAP.Through my role on the Senate Agriculture Committee, I will continue to be involved in the crafting of the next Farm Bill.Tax reform could have transformed the lives of working families and children. Instead, the GOP tax law is allowing big corporations to funnel obscene amounts of money to wealthy shareholders. https://t.co/icjKh010YTWorkforce Inclusion Is A Strength For Any Company via @forbes https://t.co/D2zKQsK0jPCould not have said it better myself... https://t.co/zPyBTdMGOeFrom the Scranton @timestribune Editorial Board: https://t.co/8gMx2o6vHMI am saddened to hear that more than 20 people, including several journalists, were killed in Kabul bombings early this morning. Just days before #WorldPressFreedomDay, this is another tragic example of journalists who are imprisoned or killed covering war and exposing corruptionPerhaps most importantly, she has shown the Senate how important it is to have staff members who have developmental and intellectual disabilities. She's helped reshape the culture of the Senate. I am proud to have had her on staff and look forward to more fellows like her.And she helped organize a first of its kind Pennsylvania Disability Employment Summit with over 250 participants.She called attention to the need for accessible supports and services for students and employees with disabilities on college campuses who have been sexually assaulted, which resulted in a bill (S. 2530) I introduced in the Senate. https://t.co/0jKp4570ynLiz helped me hold the administration accountable for disability stakeholder input into key programs.This week, Liz Weintraub completes her fellowship with my office. She has helped lead the way on disability policy in a number of significant ways. https://t.co/x4vwU3PMcGGo 'Cats! https://t.co/UT0wBNzzYcThis is supposed to be a government by the people, for the people. Not a government of the thieves and the money changers. Mick Mulvaney is a disgrace. https://t.co/0RyViQLXwM...not someone with a record of divisiveness and a tendency to support policies that make us less safe. For those reasons, I will oppose his nomination.While I appreciate Director Pompeo’s willingness to serve and plan to work with him to protect U.S. interests if he is confirmed, I simply believe that the threats facing our Nation today need a Secretary of State with greater diplomatic experience...Most military and intelligence experts agree that torture is ineffective and makes us less safe.Director Pompeo has refused to rule out torture as an intelligence gathering mechanism, saying that he would consider whether extreme practices outside the Army Field Manual need to be revisited.We need a Secretary of State who will represent all Americans to the international community.Director Pompeo supports policies that I believe will make our Nation less safe and his record on issues like torture and the Iran nuclear agreement, as well as his prior statements regarding American Muslims are troubling.After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State.I look forward to working in a bipartisan way with my colleagues throughout Congress to ensure that the Opioid Crisis Response Act is passed and signed into law.Whether working to prevent illicit fentanyl trafficking, helping opioid-dependent mothers and infants or assisting in the implementation of plans of safe care, these bills will do a great deal to strengthen our defenses as we continue to fight the opioid epidemic.I’m pleased to see these important measures be included in the Opioid Crisis Response Act, which received a favorable vote by my colleagues on the Senate HELP Committee. https://t.co/zDZBGUppNpSpecial Trump tax provision gives $17 billion break to millionaires, gov't report finds https://t.co/zlcrfJwh7RI offered an amendment that would have ensured these companies increase worker wages at the same rate they increase payouts to their executives and stockholders. Not one Republican supported it.On the same day Wells Fargo is ordered to pay $1Billion in fines for mortgage and auto lending abuses, the @AP reports that the top six banks were rewarded with $3.6 billion in tax savings last quarter from the GOP Tax Scam. https://t.co/T79tfBjSgECongratulations to the @AmRevMuseum on a successful first year! I highly recommend you visit the next time you’re in Philly! https://t.co/yYdRsNR8cf@JasonZocchi I am hopeful we can do that by working together in the same spirit we are coming together today.@JasonZocchi Many of us are committed to enacting a whole range of policies that put families first across our nation. This means making child care more affordable, making paid family leave a reality and making flexible work arrangements a standard option for workers, among other priorities.@SenDuckworth This an important step forward for the Senate. It's also one way to demonstrate this nation’s commitment to working families and policies that allow children to get off to a strong, smart start to their lives.Congratulations to @SenDuckworth on the new addition to her family and a welcome visitor to the Senate floor! https://t.co/8cfuLDV6wwFrom its outset, Israel has faced a myriad of challenges, which it has navigated successfully and against all odds. Israel continues to remain America’s strongest ally in the Middle East, as well as a central pillar of our strategy to achieve peace and stability in the region.I want to extend my warmest congratulations to the State of Israel on its 70th anniversary. Since its independence in 1948, Israel’s promotion of democratic values has helped forge a thriving society and represents freedom in a region where that value is all too scarce.Always fun to have a visit from @militaryofficer leader and Westmoreland County Commissioner Chuck Anderson. Thank you for everything you do for our military and their families! https://t.co/L5sDd2BajUSaddened to hear of the passing of the former First Lady. My thoughts are with President Bush and the entire Bush family. https://t.co/AJTxFN15LGWhat we saw last week is that discrimination and bias, both explicit and implicit, continue to pervade our society.  All of us, including businesses, community leaders, public officials, must work to root out discrimination in all its forms.It is my hope that their outlined measures to strengthen staff training regarding implicit bias and in re-affirming its position against discrimination and racial profiling will prevent another such incident from happening.During the call, Mr. Johnson outlined steps that are being taken to address what occurred. The steps he outlined were positive ones and I will be watching closely to ensure there is follow through.Over the weekend, my office was in touch with officials from Starbucks to underscore the troubling nature of this matter.This afternoon I spoke with Starbucks CEO, Kevin Johnson, to express my significant concerns about the treatment of two black men at a shop in Rittenhouse Square last Thursday.$250 billion in corporate stock buybacks that overwhelmingly benefit wealthy shareholders and CEOs - not workers. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/WFPJKRpBLRThough the Republican tax bill was sold to the public as a “middle-class miracle,” the benefits have flowed mainly to corporations and the wealthy. https://t.co/UBYXlPPOXt #TaxDayTax cut riches have gone to execs and investors over workers by nearly 3-to-1 margin https://t.co/NluTd8I25RI’m very concerned about what happened in this situation. My office has been in touch with Starbucks to get an explanation. All customers have a right to be treated equally and with respect. https://t.co/RJB7pbDuT7The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, which authorized military action in Afghanistan and Iraq, are outdated and must be replaced.Beyond the immediate situation in Syria, it’s time for a sustained debate and vote on a new AUMF that allows our nation to destroy terrorists and fight threats to U.S. national security, but doesn’t result in endless war.The Administration should seek an authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) by Congress if it wants to continue to military actions against Syrian forces - the same way President Obama sought authorization in 2013 in a similar circumstance involving Syria.Continued violence in Syria creates a safe haven for terrorists and emboldens our adversaries, Iran and Russia. Sporadic missile strikes and saber rattling on Twitter by President Trump is not a strategy.The Administration should work towards a political solution that meets the legitimate expectations of the Syrian people and leads to a constitution, elections, rule of law and functioning government ministries.There is no purely military solution to the Syrian conflict. What’s needed is a diplomatic plan to bring an end to this crisis and hold the Syrian government, the Russians and the Iranians fully accountable for their conduct.Despite being in office for fifteen months, the Administration has not taken steps to outline a comprehensive strategy for Syria. Further, the Administration has failed to request an authorization from Congress for further military action against Assad’s regime.In April of 2017, when the Trump Administration first carried out strikes against Syrian forces in response to the use of chemical weapons, I said that additional action required an authorization from CongressWhile Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable for his unlawful use of chemical weapons against civilians, the strikes that are being carried out are being done without an authorization from Congress, which is unacceptableThe GOP tax scam.... https://t.co/wZWMkV6AbBOn Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor survivors &amp; pray for those who were killed.
