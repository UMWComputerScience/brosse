I stand with all marchers across the country - especially those in NV - taking a stand against @realDonaldTrump's heinous border policy that flies in the face of our American values. We will not rest until every family is reunited &amp; treated with humanity! #FamilesBelongTogetherWe know #CourtsMatter &amp; the next #SCOTUS justice could eviscerate the rights of workers to organize &amp; bargain collectively for a fair wage. We must make our voices heard &amp; protect the future of our Supreme Court!Pleasure meeting with Col. Cheater, Wing Commander of @Creech_AFB and the Creech leadership team this week. Glad to advocate for your drone pilot program in this year's and the last NDAA bill. I will always fight to ensure you have the resources &amp; tools needed. https://t.co/6Ikny5bvcTGiven evidence by the Chinese gov't to undermine democratic institutions in the U.S., it's critical we protect our nat'l security. My &amp; @marcorubio's bill
sets requirements for the gov't to investigate &amp; report on potential Chinese government influence https://t.co/wuZ9WlpaMmExcellent news! @SunCountryAir
will offer non-stop flights from @RenoAirport to @flypdx of Portland. This announcement will serve as a great boost to Reno's tourism economy.
https://t.co/vbwGE5pbJG#TitleX funding is what millions rely on for affordable, preventative care &amp; family planning services. @realDonaldTrump's #gagrule is another pathetic attempt by him to defund @PPFA. That's why I joined @SenFeinstein &amp; other Senate Dems in a letter, calling on him to abandon it.I applaud the Department of Interior for awarding nearly $27 million to NV's rural counties through the PILT program—an increase of $800k from last year. These funds are vital to local gov'ts to provide essential services &amp; enable local leaders to invest in development projects.That's right @amyklobuchar. Stricter penalties with robocalls &amp; enforcement are needed to protect Americans from being defrauded by those who are knowingly violating the law. Our DO NOT Call Act will help ensure it. Thanks for joining us too @SenSchumer @clairecmc @SenatorHassan https://t.co/n9z2MuL0kENV's police, first responders, fire fighters, &amp; law enforcement have worked tirelessly to help our community recover from the #1October massacre. I'm glad they will be fully reimbursed with $2 million from DOJ. I'll continue to do all I can to support them
https://t.co/LJzjaW6OIhNevadans have spoken loud &amp; clear: they do not want a nuclear waste dump in their backyard. Glad my request to exclude #YuccaMountain funding in the 2019 Energy &amp; Water Development Approps bill was granted. I'll continue to fight to ensure Yucca remains a hole in the ground.The Colorado River is vital to the health &amp; well-being of NV's families &amp; economy. I'm proud to help guarantee the continuation of the System Conservation Pilot Program through language I inserted in the 2019 Energy &amp; Water Development Appropriations bill passed this week.Whoever fills the #SCOTUS seat could upend over 40 years of precedent &amp; drag America back to a time when women could be prosecuted as criminals for exercising their reproductive rights. It's going to take us all to protect a woman's right to choose, so make make your voices heardThis morning was the Change of Command Ceremony for the 99th Medical Group of @NellisAFB at Mike O'Callaghan Military Medical Center. Thank you to Colonel Virginia Garner for your incredible service and a big welcome to Colonel Alfred Flowers Jr. https://t.co/Le9WiwLKPVOver 2,000 children woke up at our southern border today terrified &amp; desperate for their parents. We must keep fighting to ensure the Trump admin reunites them. Thank you @familiesbelong @womensmarch  for coming to the Senate to demand it. This IS what democracy looks like! https://t.co/s9LUrOlnREProud my &amp; @senrobportman's amendment to create a permanent interagency rural council that would ensure NV's rural needs are heard was included in the Senate #FarmBill2018. Our amendment will encourage smart growth &amp; the innovative use of technology in rural areas.Let me be clear: a woman's right to choose is on the line with our vacant #SCOTUS seat. And now, we need to fight like hell to protect that right. 

More in my interview with @PodSaveAmerica on #SCOTUS &amp; my recent trip to the southern border. https://t.co/rlykWczxDaHeartbroken over the developing news out of Annapolis, MD. My heart is with the families of all of those impacted by this horrific event. We must work together to end the gun violence across this country. When will enough be enough? https://t.co/UbyUT5chZYThis admin must outline a clear plan for how they're reuniting these separated families &amp; ensure there's regular phone contact with one another. The Trump admin needs to fix the crisis they created. Our legislation will hold them accountable &amp; ensure these families are reunited. https://t.co/RIE9THHxsQWe're four months away from an election. We must allow the new Congress that'll be seated in January to weigh in on a #SCOTUSnominee. We must wait until the American people have a say, especially when a woman's right to choose is on the line. #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/znFM7sBlYZI'll be following up w/ the VA on the IG's findings that the Southern NV Healthcare System referred vets in need of prosthetic care to outside vendors, despite having a sufficient supply. We must ensure tax dollars are spent wisely &amp; vets get quality care https://t.co/J9IZCudhQsOur immigration system should show the world who we are. It should never be used as a tool to spread fear or punish parents for doing what they know is right for their kids. @realDonaldTrump's border policy flies in the face of this.
My @marieclaire op-ed https://t.co/n1lPCnH2ocAnother completely disturbing &amp; heartbreaking result of @realDonaldTrump's border policy.  Listen to a 7-yo boy, who's been separated from his family for nearly a month, as he breaks down speaking with his mother. We must continue to fight for these kids. https://t.co/rw3LUUbuL2We must use every tool we have to ensure we’re fighting for a qualified, balanced, &amp; independent-minded nominee. We must also fight to ensure the American people’s voices are heard in the November elections &amp; only consider a #SCOTUS nominee after the new Congress is seated.But let me be clear here: Nothing less than a woman's right to choose is on the line with this vacant Supreme Court seat.Justice Kennedy honored his oath to support &amp; defend our Constitution &amp; faithfully discharged his duties as a Justice on the #SCOTUS for 30 years. While I have not agreed with every decision he has signed his name to, I honor his service &amp; wish him the best in his retirement.We are a country of values &amp; laws. One of the things we value are our children. Whether they’re ours or someone else’s. We do no harm to children. What the Trump admin's doing at the border flies in the face of this. More from my border trip w/ @KNPRnews https://t.co/NE9l71tdQpThis decision will weaken working people's ability to join together in unions to improve their workplaces &amp; collectively bargain for the benefits they’ve earned. I'll continue to fight for middle &amp; working class families. The rights of union workers must remain strong &amp; protectedUnions have always been a powerful voice for better wages, safe working conditions, &amp; equal pay for equal work. Today’s #SCOTUS #JANUSvsAFSCME decision hurts American workers &amp; will further economic inequality in America. 
https://t.co/pprJuai5HEOn Monday, I tried getting into a "tender age" detention facility in Brownsville, Texas. I was denied access. Red flags went up everywhere. What's this admin hiding? What's their plan to reunite these families? We need answers. More from my border trip --&gt; https://t.co/uVKFWeCqmCThis decision allows @realDonaldTrump to continue threatening the lives of vulnerable women across America. Women deserve to know the qualifications, or lack thereof, of the ‘providers’ who they turn to for support in making their health care decisions. https://t.co/xsq0RptsWbThree years ago today, #SCOTUS ruled in favor of the right of every American to marry the person they love. While this was incredible progress in our fight for equality &amp; acceptance for all, we must continue to fight. And always push back against hatred &amp; intolerance. #LoveWins https://t.co/ljoNGZKwr3The chaos &amp; trauma I witnessed at the border falls solely on @realDonaldTrump's shoulders. The stories I heard were gut-wrenching. We must fight to ensure these families are reunited, treated w/ humanity, &amp; get a fair chance to make their case before a judge. More from my day --&gt; https://t.co/bNPKk4Wj3MOur immigration system should show the world who we are. It should never, ever be used as a tool to spread fear or punish parents for doing what they believe is right for their kids. If you agree with me, learn what you can do in my op-ed with @marieclaire https://t.co/n1lPCnH2ocThis #SCOTUS decision flies in the face of our nation’s founding principle of religious freedom. @realDonaldTrump's #MuslimBan serves only to incite recruiting for ISIS &amp; undermines efforts to protect our country. This is not who we are as Americans. https://t.co/UZike07N1cThere's a disconnect b/t what the Trump admin is telling us - &amp; what is currently happening on the ground. @HHSGov @DHSgov said @ICEgov Port Isabel Detention Facility would be the family reunification center. I was there yesterday. The staff had no idea. https://t.co/i0IobaDVJwYesterday, I was at the southern border in Texas. The stories I heard - &amp; the conditions in which immigrants are being detained in - were absolutely horrific. I'll never forget it. We must continue to demand answers from this admin. We must demand every family be reunited now. https://t.co/RMucbNAqmiHere's a recap from my day at the border. As I sit at the airport, I am overwhelmed by what I saw &amp; the stories I heard today. The most heartbreaking: parents still having no idea where their children are. We must keep fighting. We must ensure this admin reunites these families. https://t.co/WzVrohZE8HThe choice of the detainees I spoke to was to either stay in their home country &amp; be killed - or their children be killed &amp; raped - or come to this country where we have asylum laws. Pres. Trump has done away w/ this now &amp; it's not who we are as a country https://t.co/Sd1nl8BGwFThe detainees @ICEgov Port Isabel Detention Facility told me that authorities would change the TV channel when news about family separation came on. When I told them that a majority of this country knows what this admin is doing - &amp; are outraged - they smiled. They had no idea.I'm not sure how anybody could not have listened to the stories I heard &amp; have a dry eye - &amp; not want to protect these kids &amp; reunify them w/ their families. These mothers were told either you put your child on a bus or @ICEgov is going to. Makes me sick what this admin has done.Every story was heartbreaking, but THIS is what alarmed me most after speaking with these women: There are other mothers who are locked up in holding cells next to them that are STILL talking about families being separated. 

My God. I hope not. @realDonaldTrump, is this true?The six women &amp; three men I met with have all been separated from their children &amp; most have no idea where they are. And one thing was clear as day: the Trump admin has NO plan in place to reunify them. WATCH--&gt; https://t.co/ZCDRnARnPT Cc: @TheNVIndy @MichelleRindels @LuzGrayNVI spoke with mothers who have all been separated from their kids. Their kids are all under age 12. Most of them hadn't heard from their kids in weeks, or even know where they are. They told me they have not heard of any process to reunite them. Pres. Trump, this is unacceptable!I just came from the Port Isabel @ICEgov Detention Facility were I spoke with mothers who fled to the U.S. because of gang violence. Some lost family members to gang violence. They left their home country to seek asylum because they were terrified they - or their kids - were next https://t.co/gmsgEsdCOnI was scheduled to visit this children's detention facility in Brownsville, Texas but was asked to leave immediately. Something is happening here that they don't want the public to know. https://t.co/ogTM5VX1tkI'm headed to an @ICEgov facility in Los Fresnos to try &amp; speak with parents who have been separated from their children by this admin. Do they know where their kids are? Have they been in contact with them? When will they be reunited? They deserve these answers, @realDonaldTrump@realDonaldTrump I'm at the Casa el Presidente detention facility in Brownsville where this admin is holding "tender age" boys. They won't let me in. We told this admin last week we'd be coming. What is this admin hiding? When will these children be reunited with their families? We need answers! https://t.co/qfwfasMDQzToday, I'm at our southern border in Texas to demand answers from this admin &amp; see the impact of @realDonaldTrump's barbaric border policy for myself. I'll be trying to get into a children's detention facility in Brownsville soon. Follow along here throughout the day for updates.Incredibly honored to present retiring U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie Cooke with a Congressional Record, celebrating her 19 years of dedicated service. I had the privilege of working with her as AG. She embodies the NV values of leadership, service, &amp; hard work. Congratulations! https://t.co/guwuEcA3MaNV firefighters' dedication to their jobs is unmatched &amp; their courage to run towards danger saves lives everyday. I'm glad to have met with @TMFPD today &amp; tour one of Reno's newest fire stations. I'll keep fighting in Congress to ensure our firefighters have the resources needed https://t.co/XHr4wY9OjQOrganizations like @OurCenterReno is crucial to providing resources &amp; empowerment to members of the LGBTQ community, who need support when discriminated against with housing, employment, &amp; signing up for healthcare services. Grateful for the tour &amp; insight during our roundtable. https://t.co/WNOMw0foNxI'm grateful to see this mother &amp; child reunited, but it shouldn't have had to happen to begin with. @realDonaldTrump's heartless policy of separating families at the border will leave permanent emotional scars on them for a lifetime. This admin must reunite every family now. https://t.co/xMTUPVpXGSThe Nevada Urban Indians nonprofit provides comprehensive social services to northern NV's Native American communities - including medical care, victim advocacy, substance abuse &amp; suicide prevention counseling as well as housing &amp; food support. Thank you for the tour &amp; all you do https://t.co/W1HuXB3WqgNV voters made it clear they favor regulation &amp; taxation of marijuana in our state. The federal gov't must respect the rights of states who choose to legalize &amp; regulate marijuana. That's why I'm a proud original cosponsor of the #STATESAct to ensure it. https://t.co/SDgGn8HAIyWow. Complete chaos. This admin needs to do whatever it takes to reunite these kids with their families! 

This dark chapter @realDonaldTrump has written in our nation's history will be with us for generations. Certainly not the America my grandfather crossed the Rio Grande for. https://t.co/pWKp9CYujNDefense Secretary Mattis said what we've all been saying - North Korea has not taken any steps to denuclearize. @realDonaldTrump needs to back his claims up with real actions on denuclearization. https://t.co/zNLeXFZhHn.@DeptVetAffairs must continue to monitor the conditions our aging veterans live in &amp; work to improve the quality of care provided in poorly run nursing facilities. I intro'd an amendment that requires the IG to conduct an investigation of VA nursing homes with a one-star rating. https://t.co/qTgZStD0iSTo be clear: the Executive Order @realDonaldTrump signed was him doubling down on his heinous anti-immigrant agenda. Thousands of children are still separated from their parents, some in tents &amp; behind bars. We must continue to demand the admin reunite these families immediately.I applaud those airlines that have chosen morality &amp; humanity over profits. And refusing to take any part in helping execute this admin's anti-family, anti-immigrant agenda. Cc: @AmericanAir @UnitedAirways @SouthwestAir @FlyFrontier @Delta @SpiritAirlines 
https://t.co/90RMifnLECYou can guarantee I'll continue to fight like hell to get to the truth - &amp; demand the Trump admin reunite these children with their families. 

The President better believe I'm not giving up here. I'll go the mats for these kids. That's why I'll be at the border on Monday. https://t.co/dYxk1VvNNo.@SecNielsen has supported Pres. Trump's heinous border policy &amp; anti-immigrant agenda every step of the way. Any person that believes ripping a child from its parents' arms - &amp; detaining them - is no leader at all. 

It's time for @SecNielsen to resign. https://t.co/fIyr1McR6BI, along with many, have been completely horrified &amp; heartbroken over what's happening to families at our southern border. This admin has manufactured a crisis using kids as political bargaining chips for their own political gain. It's egregious &amp; immoral. https://t.co/Lv9b5hOP6pThanks to all for speaking out. But let us remember - this admin still has NO plan to reunite the thousands of children who were separated from their parents. We must continue to demand this admin reunite these families &amp; that they're treated with compassion &amp; not like prisoners.@realDonaldTrump's Executive Order still maintains his "zero tolerance" policy that prosecutes asylum-seeking parents - those fleeing extreme violence to save their kids' lives. Let's be clear, the President doubled down here. This will still keep children behind bars. MORE --&gt; https://t.co/3cPyJ9oVaJTo be clear, the Trump admin has no plan to reunify thousands of children with their parents - &amp; many have no idea where each other are or if they're okay. And the conditions they're being detained in are still barbaric. I'll be at the southwest border Monday to see it for myselfOn #WorldRefugeeDay, I strongly urge the Trump administration to heed the words of Pope Francis as the humanitarian crisis they created at our southwest border gets more heinous &amp; inhumane by the day. #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/6QKJfCAOkIWe must continue to speak out against this atrocity the @realDonaldTrump administration is inflicting on these families. While it can be overwhelming - we must not give up. We must roll up our sleeves &amp; fight like hell for these children &amp; the values this country holds so dear. https://t.co/EcOrJBca5x"Play rooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis" - this is how lawyers &amp; medical professionals described the "tender age" shelters detaining toddlers 5 &amp; under. The physiological &amp; emotional scars being inflicted on them will be felt for a lifetime. https://t.co/ynIbHgciR0My &amp; @SenatorCollins' BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act sets the tone that this is a public health crisis &amp; we're creating an infrastructure that's necessary for that coordinated plan that's needed. We have a system in this bill that we can all tap into. That's the key. https://t.co/9HlYD8go8BThe President needs to stop spewing his ridiculous lies. This humanitarian crisis is one he created the moment AG Sessions announced their evil "zero tolerance" policy. He could end this atrocity today. All he has to do is say the word. Instead, he continues to use kids as pawns. https://t.co/1r3HKYsf2jOn #Juneteenth we commemorate the emancipation of the last enslaved Africans in America &amp; celebrate the fulfillment of independence. As we honor the sanctity of freedom, we recommit ourselves to taking action to challenge the ignorance &amp; cruelty that perpetuated American slavery. https://t.co/mIbvKXa5cW.@realDonaldTrump, these families are fleeing extreme violence. They'd rather take this journey then stay in their home country b/c if they stay, that means they or their family members could end up dead. You must end this evil policy of separating them. Where is your conscience? https://t.co/zSYjl5PI2UThe Trump admin's policy of separating families at the border is downright evil. I'm not afraid to get loud about this. And will continue to do so until every child is reunited with their parents. Join me &amp; demand @realDonaldTrump put an end to this!  https://t.co/a5ywB15huGI second that, @SenJeffMerkley. Absolutely gut-wrenching &amp; beyond disturbing. I'm still in shock this is happening in THIS country. It's got to end. https://t.co/e36W2vr7zAJust today alone, nearly 97% of the calls my office has received on the Trump admin's vile policy of separating families at the border are OPPOSED to it. This is an American issue about who we are as a nation. 

Urge your representatives to SUPPORT the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct! https://t.co/mJkG0LOxsPThis humanitarian crisis falls solely on the shoulders of the Trump admin. There is no law on the books that mandates separating families. Instead of doing the humane &amp; moral thing by ending this policy, @realDonaldTrump continues to lie &amp; use children to score political points. https://t.co/NNhduznxNk"This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart." Thank you, @laurawbush, for speaking out against this heinous policy. It is an affront to the heart &amp; soul of our country. The Trump admin &amp; his GOP allies must heed your words. https://t.co/xYrAxuStiR@SecNielsen This is a blatant lie. We must continue to speak out &amp; demand the Trump administration end their barbaric policy of separating families at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogetherHappy #FathersDay to all of NV's fathers &amp; to those who are father figures for many.

Today is also a reminder of the cruelty of the Trump admin's policy of separating families at the border. We must continue to fight back &amp; speak out to #KeepFamiliesTogether #FathersDayofActionWe must ensure internships are not out of reach for anyone. This is a great step. I'm also proud my provision requiring the Senate Placement Office establish an Internship Opportunities Bulletin was approved, ensuring more accessibility to internships. https://t.co/cvhT6lbNDsFallon FORGE did a fantastic job in promoting Nevada's geothermal resources.

I'm delighted with his commitment in doing so. It's critical we are engaging local stakeholders as we look to deploy broadband &amp; much needed infrastructure updates. https://t.co/eomYlmTk7dThe Trump admin's anti-immigrant agenda has forced #DACA recipients to live their lives in fear &amp; put their futures on hold. On the 6th anniversary of #DACA, I say to #DREAMers &amp; their families: YOU are what makes us great. I stand with you. You belong here &amp; you're #HereToStay https://t.co/LwPoZB1r6qThank you, @TMFPD, for helping to get the word out in what we can all do to play our part to help prevent wild fires. And more importantly, we're grateful for the lifesaving work you do to keep us safe! https://t.co/GizIyvAEliNevada voters made it clear that they favor the regulation &amp; taxation of marijuana in our state. The federal gov't must respect the rights of states to do so. As an original co-sponsor of the #STATESAct, I thank @GovSandoval for supporting this effort. https://t.co/6pFaoVB0B9But let me be clear: it's @realDonaldTrump who could fix both these crises today if he wanted to. He says he "hates to see separation of parents &amp; children" - but let's be honest: the only thing he hates more is working with Democrats to keep them together #FamiliesBelongTogetherRepublican leadership continues to ignore the bipartisan solutions right in front of them in favor of purely partisan tactics, just to throw red meat at their base. Congress could fix these problems if @realDonaldTrump &amp; his GOP allies got out of the way &amp; let us do our jobs..@realDonaldTrump created a crisis when he ended #DACA. @realDonaldTrump created a crisis when he implemented the barbaric policy of separating families at the border. @realDonaldTrump refuses to accept that he's the one to blame here. https://t.co/PNt7KkJvZbThe Trump administration's policy of separating families at the border, including those fleeing extreme violence &amp; horrific conditions, must end. We must continue to raise our voices &amp; demand @realDonaldTrump  put a stop to this cruelty. Every single day, I'll fight until he doesI come from a family of proud @USArmy veterans. My father &amp; grandfathers answered the call of duty. They learned the virtues of service, integrity, &amp; respect. On the Army's 243rd birthday, we thank all those that have served &amp; are currently serving for your sacrifices #ArmyBDayProud to fight alongside @familiesbelong demanding the admin end its barbaric policy of separating families at the border. Let's be clear: this crisis wasn't caused by Congress. It was caused by Pres. Trump. And you can bet I'll keep fighting like hell b/c #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/WPtHUeyjQTHAPPENING at 5:45pm ET/2:45pm PT --&gt; I'll be joining @familiesbelong to call on @realDonaldTrump to put an end to the manufactured crisis his administration created by separating families at our southwest border.

Here I thought I was horrified before. After reading this thread, I felt physically nauseous. I am outraged. I am disgusted. And my heart is breaking. But I promise this - I will fight like hell to help end this #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/T69864nRxdWe have always been a country that helps those in need. The Trump administration is trying to slam our doors on women &amp; families fleeing violence or horrific circumstances. 

I refuse to stand idly by. RT to show @realDonaldTrump you won't either! #FamiliesBelongTogetherAcross the country, thousands are organizing rallies, marches, &amp; vigils to protest the cruel separation of children from their parents at the border &amp; holding children in detention centers. @realDonaldTrump could end his barbaric policy today. Join me to demand he do it! https://t.co/YOjZcO7Ce3The Trump admin's openness to nationalizing our 5G network is extremely alarming &amp; could have serious consequences. Today, I pressed the NTIA Administrator on whether he believed doing so would have a chilling effect on the private sector. Watch to hear his response --&gt; https://t.co/ifnyRzpDdDDeeply concerned with Saudi-led forces assault in Yemen today. Millions are already near famine &amp; this vicious campaign could make the situation even more catastrophic. The Trump admin must do more to bring peace &amp; humanitarian goods to save lives in Yemen https://t.co/4evCKrBZveA recent study found the death toll in Puerto Rico after #HurricaneMaria is over 4,600 - nearly 70x more than what the Trump admin's reporting. Yet, we hear nothing but crickets from FEMA &amp; HHS. I joined @SenWarren in a letter demanding answers from them. https://t.co/thV3JmiaoBLooks like @realDonaldTrump is borrowing a page from racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s playbook. And while Arpaio may have gotten a pardon for his disgusting actions; history will not pardon the racist &amp; inhumane actions of this admin. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Yr2ABY0b9vI agree, @SenatorMenendez. It's inhumane, it disgusts me, &amp; it flies in the face of our American values. The Trump administration must put an end to this barbaric policy immediately. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/mDR0n6KqYDThanks @PattyMurray for demanding answers of HHS Sec. Azar on what his agency is doing to ensure that kids being cruelly ripped from their parents' arms at the border are safe &amp; what his plans for reunification are. We won't stop demanding answers because #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/QRG0sOB8sdI'm encouraged to see diplomatic negotiations take place, but it would be foolish to trust a regime that's broken the same promises before. Until we see progress, sanctions must remain &amp; the admin must develop &amp; share with Congress a clear &amp; robust plan on how they'd implement itAG Sessions' reversal of this important - &amp; sometimes lifesaving - precedent closes the door on thousands of vulnerable people threatened by violence. Sending refugees back to their home countries is a death sentence. This sickens me &amp; isn't who we are. https://t.co/LspvhsNUpB#SCOTUS decision to allow states to purge eligible voters from voter rolls turns voting in to a “use it or lose it” scenario. This is a dangerous attack on low-income &amp; minority voters especially. Our democracy depends on fair &amp; equal access to the polls https://t.co/PoQ4E5yt4nThe internet doesn’t belong to @AjitPaiFCC &amp; @realDonaldTrump, it belongs to the American people. If you agree, take action TODAY and fight to save #NetNeutrality! We have a bipartisan solution to #SaveTheInternet &amp; @SpeakerRyan needs to bring it to the House floor for a vote.Today, @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect. There aren't many bipartisan solutions to big problems in Washington these days, but the Senate's bipartisan CRA to #SaveTheInternet is one! @SpeakerRyan just needs to bring it to a vote b/c the internet belongs to us all.Nations around the globe do seek to influence public opinion &amp; policy debates beyond their borders. But the Chinese efforts go well beyond this. I led a bipartisan letter to the Trump admin urging them to craft a comprehensive strategy to counter this. https://t.co/YMfApSIXxV55 years after President Kennedy signed the #EqualPayAct on this day, gender wage discrimination still exists. The pay disparity hampers women's ability to help provide for their families. It's past time Congress pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to close the gender pay gap.Separating a child from their parents has a traumatizing impact. The @realDonaldTrump admin's policy in separating families at the SW border is inhumane, barbaric, &amp; completely defies our values as Americans. I joined @SenateDems calling on Pres.

You gave the Las Vegas community something that we'll forever be grateful for: healing, hopefulness, &amp; unity - at a time when we needed it most. Thank you for that. #VegasStrong https://t.co/DKtLpHrubJThe tragic deaths of #AnthonyBourdain &amp; #KateSpade is a reminder that suffering from mental health issues doesn't discriminate. We must destigmatize  mental health issues. We must talk about them. We must ensure resources are available to those that need it. And we must be kind.@ChrisVanHollen @Capitals @SenDeanHeller we may be down 3-1, but we're certainly not out! ready for game 5 in my hometown...the comeback starts tonight, my friend! #goknightsgo #nocaps #battleborn https://t.co/hIEKqKLhJ1NV's caregivers make personal &amp; financial sacrifices so their elderly loved ones can live in comfort. We must ensure these unsung heroes receive the financial support they need to keep their family members safe &amp; well cared for. Proud to partner with you &amp; @maziehirono on this. https://t.co/CQAIsbXPOcNV voters have made it clear that they favor the regulation &amp; taxation of marijuana in the state. The states who legalize &amp; regulate marijuana should be respected. That's why I'm proud to cosponsor @SenWarren @SenCoryGardner's #STATESAct to ensure they are https://t.co/dvHlbhA7BBThis is yet another example of Mick #Mulvaney doing whatever he can to gut the Consumer Bureau. Once again, he's putting the interests of the #BigBanks ahead of the everyday consumers the agency was created to protect. https://t.co/7JNU2QzHxXI commend @USDOT for prioritizing the revitalization of three of NV's rural airports in Ely, Elko, &amp; Battle Mountain. The $14.8 million will go toward improving their runways &amp; updating other vital #infrastructure needs. 
https://t.co/433vHW2U8SSeeking asylum in the U.S. isn't illegal. It's written in our immigration laws to ensure those with a credible fear of persecution can present their case. Families need access to a fair process &amp; the ability to seek asylum without the threat of separation #FamiliesBelongTogetherI was honored to be included, @ChrisMurphyCT! Thank you for inviting me. These bright community leaders &amp; activists inspired me greatly. Your Latino Leadership Academy program is helping to ensure these folks have the tools they need to run for public office &amp; it's critical! https://t.co/Rc4lVxHeoFThis #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, we honor the immigrants &amp; refugees from around the world that have fled oppression, poverty, &amp; persecution - &amp; traveled to America in search of a better life for themselves &amp; their families. #IStandWithImmigrantsThis is my grandfather. He was born in Mexico &amp; crossed the Rio Grande to pursue the American Dream. He proudly served our country in WWII, settled in NV, &amp; became a baker. Now his granddaughter's serving as the 1st Latina Senator. This is what makes us great #CelebrateImmigrants https://t.co/A4woO1nQ57The Trump admin is playing politics with people's lives by acting as if they have no choice but to pull babies from their mothers' arms. This heinous practice lacks all humanity. LISTEN to what I'm doing to #KeepFamiliesTogether in my interview w/ @npratc https://t.co/8xSvqoTwqhThat's why it's absolutely critical that we not lose sight of our obligation to demand &amp; implement reforms that will make real, fundamental, &amp; meaningful change. I am glad @JerryMoran has committed to hold additional hearings with the new leadership in these organizations. https://t.co/w5HLeFKCZsBut the focus now must be on changing the culture so it protects young athletes in the future. Never again can we see this type of systemic failure where there's actually a breeding ground for predators that are taking advantage of our young athletes. We need reforms now. https://t.co/QoerFouYvmThe USOC, USA Gymnastics, &amp; the governing boards failed our kids when they turned a blind eye to assault. Worse, there was a lack of opportunity for these young people to come forward because they didn't feel safe. Today, I pressed a former USA Gymnastics employee for answers. https://t.co/HP3e7bEiriNearly 75% of the area around Lake Tahoe is public land managed by @forestservice. And with the increasing outlook for significant wildfire potential in northwestern NV, it's critical the USFS' taking precautions to help safeguard it. WATCH my exchange with the agency's Chief --&gt; https://t.co/eYCZQDU0BSYou are right, @SenTinaSmith - when woman are at the table, we all benefit. Congratulations on your maiden speech! https://t.co/BTYZGGVbjZThank you, @ChrisMurphyCT, for your persistence in pressing @BetsyDeVosED to acknowledge that teachers can't report undocumented students to ICE. My letter with @SenatorMenendez @RepEspaillat to her outlines that ALL students have the right to a public education. Period. https://t.co/PIvJzhuuZWIf @realDonaldTrump won't abide by our Constitution, courts must require him to do so. Nearly 200 Members of Congress will ask the courts to do just that on June 7th. #NoOneAboveTheLaw  https://t.co/g86Xqjy5fM.@BetsyDeVosED' comments have families fearing deportation at the hands of school personnel. @SenatorMenendez, @RepEspaillat &amp; myself call on her to correct the record &amp; clarify that all kids have a right to an education, no matter their immigration status https://t.co/aZ2bNewXoq https://t.co/gRHowIbCm8This. https://t.co/WYmjBmBBM9Nobody is fooled by @realDonaldTrump's lies. The inhumane &amp; cruel policy that's separating families at the southern border is in fact a direct result of this admin's relentless attacks on immigrant families. Only President Trump can end it. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/J12xdkbxUgthat's right. let's do this! #goknightsgo #nocaps #homemeansnevada https://t.co/a5rngNEoP9Thank you, @gbbco for the tour of your impressive Reno facility last week. It's critical we help ensure small brewers can compete, which is why I was glad the Craft Beverage Modernization &amp; Tax Reform Act was included in the spending bill. Oh, &amp; I also enjoyed the tasting, too! https://t.co/tN5fkbwYOIToday, #SCOTUS had the opportunity to take a stand against discrimination. I'm disappointed it didn't take this opportunity to say so unequivocally. We must continue to fight for the #EqualityAct to ensure protections for LGBTQ Americans. Discrimination has no place in America.You can apply for a #DACA renewal even if your last application was rejected, specifically due to not meeting the October 5, 2017 deadline. Apply → https://t.co/GejjEPfZ48Right now, you can still apply to renew your #DACA status. If you meet the requirements to apply for DACA renewal, you should apply → https://t.co/GejjEPfZ48 https://t.co/Rk28ZCyJIw.@Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, told Congress that users own their own data. So, why did Facebook allow device makers to access users' friends' information without their consent? This raises even more questions about whether Facebook complied w/ the 2011 FTC consent agreement. https://t.co/VfG00AZLjgI had a great time touring @KimmieCandy's factory in Reno last week. They're best known for their Sunburst &amp; ChocoRocks treats - which we give out to visitors in our DC office &amp; are a hit! Thank you to their CEO, Joe, for showing me around &amp; teaching me more about your operation. https://t.co/IkY7gk3Ek4Thank you for having me! https://t.co/Zsmvf91XOdWelcome! And thank you to Admiral Zukunft for your service. https://t.co/8ACRjXiu9QAlzheimer's is one of the most debilitating diseases. It's critical we understand its challenges &amp; how best to educate on early prevention. I was honored to host a roundtable in Reno on exactly that &amp; discuss my BOLD Act w/ @SenatorCollins that would help address these elements. https://t.co/JHA1Rp8JlcJenny with @MomsDemand is right. #GunViolenceAwarenessDay is about taking action. If you want to see commonsense gun reform - continue speaking out, continue organizing, &amp; continue demanding that Congress act to prevent gun violence. When will enough be enough? #WearOrange https://t.co/GPcAehcKXoBorn out of the Stonewall riots that rocked our nation almost 50 years ago, #PrideMonth celebrates truth, honors courage, &amp; embraces love. I honor the sacrifices so many LGBTQ Americans have made in the fight for equality &amp; stand by them in the march toward that &amp; acceptance. https://t.co/OAL7FJKDtqIncredibly honored to be a part of the Moving Wall ceremony at Eastside Memorial Park in Minden today. A replica of a smaller version of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, this gives Nevadans an opportunity to honor &amp; pay their respects to the brave Americans who perished in the war. https://t.co/HwaZw8buDLThe practice of separating children from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane &amp; cruel. Seeking asylum is not illegal. It is written into US immigration laws to ensure that those with a credible fear of persecution can present their case. #FamiliesBelongTogetherImmigrant families fleeing violence &amp; danger from their home countries should not have to experience additional suffering by being torn apart from their loved ones. Today I stand in solidarity with thousands of Americans who understand that #FamiliesBelongTogether!The epidemic of gun violence is a national crisis. We've seen it in Sante Fe, Parkland, my hometown of Las Vegas...the list of communities devastated by gun violence is long. We must continue to demand Congress step &amp; act to reduce gun violence #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay https://t.co/4lvSqINvsYI've always believed that diversity makes our country great &amp; we are stronger for it. We must remain committed to fighting for immigrants’ rights, protecting the immigrant community &amp; reforming our broken immigration system. #IHM2018 https://t.co/b34LXLkuzqThe Trump admin's practice of punishing parents who are trying to save their children’s lives, &amp; punishing children for being brought to safety by their parents by separating them is fundamentally cruel &amp; un-American. #FamiliesBelongTogetherNV's public lands belong to us all. And they're critical to our outdoor economy. We must protect them for generations. That's why yesterday, I was pleased to join @patagonia &amp; NV conservationists in Reno discussing the importance of civic activism, including with 10 yo, Robbie! https://t.co/6a6IlwwQ5WHonored to tour Eddy House in Reno today. Many of NV's homeless youth have found care &amp; shelter in Eddy House. The services they provide are crucial to putting vulnerable kids on a pathway to stability &amp; success. Eddy House is an example of how to best address youth homelessness. https://t.co/vdqd0hOsx6The Trump admin's policy of separating families at the border is inhumane &amp; not who we are as Americans. Worse, the "zero tolerance policy" means families fleeing violence are being torn apart, leaving parents with no way to contact their kids. It must end https://t.co/EeDKpwLskvIt's critical we build on the momentum NV currently has in advancing tech &amp; innovation in our state. I was pleased to sit down with stakeholders in Reno today to discuss how best NV can integrate tech, transpo, service delivery, housing, &amp; workforce development. #InnovationState https://t.co/Yz1Op42ZjjWe must ensure that NV's students are equipped with the skills they need to succeed in a 21st century economy. I was delighted to tour @BestBuy Teen Tech Center in Las Vegas &amp; meet teens taking advantage of this resource through hands-on activities that explore their interests. https://t.co/ddyrlFiX9Rwe've got you! next one is ours. #goknightsgo #nocaps https://t.co/UgR3nSEqnpMy discussion today with women veterans in the Southern NV community served as a reminder that women veterans face a unique set of challenges while transitioning out of the military, like accessing affordable childcare. We must ensure our veterans have the support they need. https://t.co/fbr9orWInNAs NV's AG, I saw firsthand what happened when the #BigBanks engaged in risky behavior &amp; predatory lending practices because of lack of oversight &amp; regulation. The road that allows banks to police themselves again is a dangerous one we shouldn't go down. https://t.co/pLEPD9sYDeLast week, I sat down with my friends @lpackard @Jbmlv702Joe who say the #ACA saved their lives. But @POTUS &amp; the GOP are adamant in sabotaging this law. And right now, #junkplans &amp; skyrocketing premiums are hurting Nevadans. WATCH to hear what they think about #ACASabotage ➡️ https://t.co/H85xdOBJrdThrilled to tour the Boulder Highway Collaborative Community Campus today. This state-of-the-art complex is a product of a partnership between Nevada HAND &amp; community orgs. Also a great example of how federal &amp; state investments can support the work of nonprofits helping families https://t.co/07zOjES0D4Thank you, @MIW_Nevada for discussing a growing problem in NV - the rising cost of childcare. The cost of childcare in NV is one of the highest in the country. We must ensure working parents don't have to choose between leaving a job they love or pay outrageous childcare costs. https://t.co/HvnCzwxpm1It was an absolute pleasure to meet these three bright young people, in Las Vegas today, that I nominated to the Service Academies. I look forward to learning about your promising futures in the years ahead! And we're grateful to you for your future service to our country. https://t.co/CTPzEP0l2gWhile I'm glad @united has changed their policy in storing pets in overhead bins, the FAA should prohibit all airlines from doing so. My &amp; @SenJohnKennedy's #WOOFF Act would do that. We must ensure the well-being of our pets is protected when traveling. https://t.co/xglrxmrPIa👏👏👏#GoKnightsGo! https://t.co/AzZFQnGawWI was honored to join the families of some of our faithful veterans today at Bunker's Woodlawn Cemetery's #MemorialDay ceremony. The sacrifices their loved ones made in service to our country will never be forgotten. https://t.co/rfGmx6sIIxStill can't believe we're getting to cheer you on in the #StanleyCupFinal! We're so proud of you, @GoldenKnights. Let's do this! #GoKnightsGo https://t.co/7Wblly9ttPToday, we recognize the bravery of our fallen servicemembers &amp; remember their dedication in defense of our freedom. We will never forget your commitment to our nation’s values &amp; can never repay your sacrifice. I offer my deepest gratitude to our fallen heroes. #MemorialDay2018 https://t.co/buW59MLh4kOver 400k Nevadans have gained healthcare coverage through the #ACA. But @realDonaldTrump's relentless efforts to sabotage this law is hurting Nevadans. And they deserve better. After hearing from patients &amp; advocates today, I'm more committed than ever to ensuring we protect it https://t.co/KkCr7RpGOlThank you @MomsDemand @Everytown for your conversation in Las Vegas today. Your advocacy in working to end gun violence couldn't be more important. I stand with you in calling on Congress to step up &amp; pass legislation that will help to end gun violence &amp; save lives. https://t.co/QWCWFjRSFVThanks to @realDonaldTrump's #ACA sabotage, junk plans have been extended &amp; healthcare premiums are skyrocketing across the country. 

If you're a Nevadan - learn how you can find a safe, affordable, &amp; quality healthcare insurance plan today --&gt; https://t.co/Z44R54o7XuEvery NV student &amp; educator should have access to the unlimited knowledge &amp; vital services the internet offers, but too many counties lack access.

 https://t.co/TBr7xqQZJxCongratulations to Battle Mountain High School for placing 10th in @SIFMAFoundation's 2018 #CapitolHillChallenge! I was proud to sponsor you - &amp; Skype with the team to learn more about it last month. What a great way to round out the school year!.@BetsyDeVosED comments this week on leaving it to schools to decide whether to report undocumented children are plain wrong &amp; completely reckless. Every child in this country has a right to a basic education, regardless of their immigration status. Period https://t.co/px6ktQUdAWIn 2015, #TitleX provided contraceptive care for 3.8 million women. And in NV alone, there were 17 #TitleX family planning clinics that received funding, providing care for 10,310 women. @realDonaldTrump's move to gut this funding is an attack on women's health &amp; freedoms. https://t.co/HekBiut5rcWelcome, Colonel Craddock! And a big thank you to Colonel Murray for your outstanding work at Nellis AFB &amp; in the southern NV community. https://t.co/yw2ZDVz28jIn NV alone, a recent study predicts premium costs for Nevadans on the healthcare exchanges would cost them an additional $843 next year. Hardworking NV families cannot take on costs like this. And we have @realDonaldTrump's #ACA sabotage to thank for it.
https://t.co/t3KeyI1FZ5Did you know that the renewal process for #DACA is still available for some? Visit @UnitedWeDream’s website and learn all about the resources you need. #HereToStay --&gt; https://t.co/9glrQubbCfAll #DACA recipients need to know the information available to them about renewals. @UnitedWeDream has created this website to help you navigate this difficult process. #HereToStay --&gt; https://t.co/9glrQubbCfHotel &amp; casino workers work behind the scenes &amp; in the front of the house to keep our city thriving - &amp; showing why Las Vegas hospitality is the best in the world. Our workers deserve to have their rights upheld &amp; to demand better working conditions &amp; better pay. https://t.co/vqPZT1wqBmWe appreciate the @NCAA suspending its championship host policy. But @SenatorMenendez &amp; I urge a permanent change to be made, which would provide certainty in the bidding &amp; hosting process moving forward. https://t.co/sNc7FUa5PbExcited Las Vegas' first @WNBA team will be playing in Washington, DC tonight! You know who'll be rooting for. Go, @LVAces! https://t.co/lFWAiyP8MtForeign investments help grow our economy &amp; promote jobs, but they must be met with responsible oversight. Countries like China use investment to undermine our security. I’m proud my amendments protect our military bases, businesses, &amp; democratic institutions from those threats. https://t.co/XeNZ8OfFtxProud to support your amendment in the Banking Committee, @ChrisVanHollen. China’s ZTE violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea. This Administration is trading our national security for an empty trade deal that will only benefit Chinese workers. https://t.co/aYJnLCcS37We cannot turn a blind eye to the absolute human horrors of the conflict in #Syria. The U.S. has spent $14 billion to defeat #ISIS there.  It's imperative that @realDonaldTrump present Congress with a clear strategy for Syria. Yesterday, I introduced legislation calling for it.The Consumer Bureau was created to level the playing field &amp; empower consumers to make informed financial decisions. The public nature of the database is critical to making this system work. Recently, I joined in a letter calling on #Mulvaney to protect it https://t.co/Vh1f1q3eRSIt’s reprehensible the Consumer Bureau has no interest in fulfilling its mission to protect consumers &amp; is instead looking out for the special interests. Americans should be offered the same rates based on their credit; not terms based on their skin color. https://t.co/yCK7H4sHLBThough Congress has yet to appropriate any funds to the NRC around #YuccaMountain, I'm concerned the NRC is moving in a direction to use allocated funds for a purpose that hasn't been authorized. I sent a letter to the NRC Chairman asking her to outline the NRC's intentions. https://t.co/u44euVgwUzMandatory arbitration does not only favor employers, it also disproportionately affects women and minority employees.

This decision is a step backward. Congress must act to ensure employees can collectively enforce their rights.

https://t.co/l3F6G0s5YtAmazing!! Congratulations, @GoldenKnights! https://t.co/UKJfjlUXJYHappy 50th Anniversary, @unrmed! Thank you for leading the way to better health for Nevadans across the state. And congratulations to the graduates of the #Classof2018! #UNRMed50 #PackPrideHoping folks got to take advantage of the exciting new @limebike fleet in Reno on #BikeToWorkDay! Glad my staff was able to attend the launch this week. This year-long pilot will provide many with the opportunity to watch their carbon footprint, while getting some exercise, too! https://t.co/tX5TEAL39yHere we go again. @realDonaldTrump continues his war on women's health. This is an attack on @PPFA &amp; an attack on every women's right to choose. A women's healthcare decision is between her &amp; her doctor - &amp; them alone. No politician - or @POTUS - has a right to stand between that https://t.co/TpUYli2EAMHeartbreaking news out of Santa Fe, Texas. My heart goes out to the students, faculty, and their families. Once again, another community is left devastated by gun violence. When will enough be enough? This must end.Individuals overcome with addiction shouldn't be met with fake recovery programs &amp; harmful treatment scams. By empowering the FTC &amp; state attorneys general to punish bad actors, my &amp; @SenCapito's bill will help ensure addiction victims have access to safe, effective treatments. https://t.co/KDgu5wxKwwI welcome this news from @NCAA suspending their championship host policy. Last year myself, @SenatorMenendez &amp; @SenBooker called on @NCAA to reevaluate its position preventing championship play in sports betting states. Soon, I'll be calling on them to make this change permanent. https://t.co/JY3Kc6pGftOn Infrastructure Workers Appreciation Day, we thank our transportation workers for their hard work in building &amp; maintaining our roads, highways, &amp; bridges that we travel on every day. It is past time we address some of our nation's crumbling infrastructure in a bipartisan way.#GinaHaspel chose to be an accessory to the CIA's illegal &amp; unconstitutional torture regime, supporting waterboarding, &amp; the outright humiliation of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. Her complicity darkened the light of our legal system &amp; rule of law to the entire world. I voted no https://t.co/MGQO9rNDbHThis isn't the Salem witch trials. This is about protecting the integrity of our elections. It's about ensuring Mueller's ability to find the truth. And @SenatorBurr says Russia interfered in our elections. 

@SenateMajLdr, the time is now to bring #ProtectMueller bill for a vote https://t.co/doDHpg6nIAThat's right @SenJoniErnst. The commission proposed in our bill will provide guidance on how we cultivate AI to help ensure we stay ahead of countries like China in this space, while also building guardrails to make certain the U.S. gov't responsibly uses artificial intelligence https://t.co/l1DZ3U0bm9.@realDonaldTrump, would you speak that way about your ancestors? Let me tell you something: When you attack immigrants, you're attacking me. You're attacking my grandfather who crossed the Rio Grande to pursue the American Dream. RT to tell Pres. Trump you stand with immigrants! https://t.co/nPeI4mqBdAPowerful message during #NationalPoliceWeek @WashoeSheriff. NV's police officers work tirelessly to make sure our communities are safe &amp; secure. Their hard work, courage, &amp; sacrifice should not go unnoticed. We are grateful to you. https://t.co/a06kvk7cvhCouldn't agree more, @JRosenworcel! https://t.co/p7PPaQH3y2We know the environmental benefits to fuel efficient cars. But Nevadans want more fuel efficient cars to save them money, too. I've met with automakers who've stressed that they don't want to roll back auto CAFE standards. I pressed the NHTSA Administrator nom on the Admin's plan https://t.co/Re7qbj9SZlIf #YuccaMountain were to be revived, it wouldn't just be Nevadans' backyards that would turn into a nuclear waste dump. 75-90% of the nuclear waste would travel by rail across the country. Today, an NTSB nominee confirmed that if an accident happened "it could be devastating." https://t.co/uWlH77KU8cNot if we can help it! Thank you to all of you that raised your voice to protect #NetNeutrality, we got the votes we needed for it to pass. But this fight isn't over, we must keep the pressure on the House to vote to save a free &amp; open internet as we know it. Keep speaking out! https://t.co/KefBn0eelzSOON, the #Senate will be voting on a bill that would save #NetNeutrality. If there were ever a time to raise your voice to save a free &amp; open internet, that time is now! I urge you to speak out &amp; call, tweet, email your Members of Congress telling them to protect #NetNeutrality! https://t.co/2bqgVX2e36The #Senate will vote TODAY to save  #NetNeutrality! This will be one of the most consequential votes on the internet we've taken in modern history &amp; it's going to be close. 

That's why I need YOU to raise your voice to help democrats save the free &amp; open internet as we know it! https://t.co/3Sbkd0w4FcI expect members of @realDonaldTrump's Cabinet to challenge his decisions when they're wrong, &amp; reject his worst instincts &amp; ignorance. In my view, #GinaHaspel is not up to that job &amp; will not have my vote. https://t.co/zdLldl8wjSI'm proud to co-sponsor a resolution recognizing #NationalPoliceWeek, including honoring Chad Parque &amp; Charleston Hartfield, NV officers killed in the line of the duty last year.

A happy birthday to my hometown! https://t.co/6M662h9UVC.@realDonaldTrump wants to help ZTE “get back into business." That means: spying on America’s military &amp; intel community, stealing U.S. intellectual property, &amp; shirking Iran &amp; North Korea sanctions. I’m calling on the Administration to protect our national security &amp; economy. https://t.co/meWkisN78DIt's concerning that Hispanics make up just 7% of #tech employees. Diversity makes us stronger, &amp; it makes our tech companies more competitive &amp; profitable. I stand with the @HispanicCaucus in calling for #DIVERSITYinTECH. #LATISMTomorrow, the Senate will vote on a CRA to save #NetNeutrality.

He beat his opponents in the boxing ring, took on the mob in Nevada, and moved bills in the Senate that no one believed could be done. He'll beat cancer too. I wish him a speedy and successful recovery.#DoddFrankRollback repealed critical housing reporting requirements that shed light on lending discrimination. My amendment would have protected them. This report shows it's still happening at an alarming rate. This is plain wrong &amp; we need to address it. https://t.co/xd2XOgZugnWe're on the clock.

Today - &amp; everyday - we are grateful to you. #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay https://t.co/V59EPWhM8mPleased to see the FCC is aggressively enforcing the law against abusive &amp; unlawful robocalls.

And will never see the light of day. https://t.co/l6fSrKfyMiThe House can vote all they want to revive #YuccaMountain, but let's be clear - any bill that would turn Nevadans' backyards into a nuclear waste dump is dead on arrival.

#OurHomesOurVoices #CutsHurtThe Trump administration’s #ACAsabotage is reversing the monumental gains made by the Latino community under our healthcare system. @realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP need to stop working to undo what's working &amp; start building upon what is. https://t.co/aKCmWkYZ6LEnding cost sharing payments, expanding #junkplans, cutting funds to help Americans #getcovered, putting insurance companies back in charge &amp; more; it’s all part of the GOP’s work to dismantle our healthcare system &amp; allow #Trumpcare to wreak havoc on Nevada families. https://t.co/RFwXr2YzuyLet's be clear: the GOP blew up our deficit in order to give big corporations &amp; the top 1% a tax cut they didn't need.

Once again, proof Mulvaney has no business leading the @CFPBMulvaney admitted to his 1,300 closest banker friends that his Congressional office sold access to lobbyists who contributed to his campaign.
