There was no better way to kick off my day this morning than having a conversation with our future leaders!5 years ago today, the Shelby County v. Holder decision gutted the Voting Rights Act, leaving states like Alabama vulnerable to voter suppression laws. We must protect voters from those who attempt to infringe on their rights as citizens of our great country.GREAT news! The amendment @BillCassidy &amp; I introduced to require greater transparency about VA-run nursing home quality just passed in the Senate! This is a step forward to provide the care our veterans deserve and have earned.Got to sit down with @finebaum today—no word on who Alabama will start at QB against Louisville, but he did promise to tailgate with me the next time #SECNation is in Auburn or Tuscaloosa! https://t.co/R27DFdwNaKREMINDER: TODAY is the @fema registration deadline to apply for federal disaster assistance following the storms of March 19-20 in Calhoun, Cullman, and Etowah counties.

A pioneer for women in science, this year we continue to see her legacy in all the ways women have &amp; continue to break down barriers. https://t.co/fjzBJkLsL7Tearing families apart is contrary to our American values. We must stop this cruel policy, but also work toward long-term solutions that will actually address the underlying problem. Read my statement here about my support for the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, which is a 1st step. https://t.co/X0wb6djeSkHappy #FathersDay to all the dads and granddads out there!

I wish you a happy celebration to the end of your peaceful month of fasting.It’s appalling to me that someone could use the Bible to justify tearing children away from their families. This @TheJusticeDept policy is not a law—HUGE difference—and it defies our values as Americans. I’m exploring every option available to halt this policy.Calling all Alabamians! Next time you’re in DC, I hope you can stop by one of my “Donuts with Doug” events to catch up over a cup of coffee &amp; donut. The first one is this TUESDAY, JUNE 19!

We need to recognize the importance of this program for Alabama and the U.S. by increasing resources for another LCS in the Senate’s Defense bill. https://t.co/V6z4a3FyPKA smart, commonsense bill I’m proud to cosponsor, @SenWarner’s SAME Act shuts down the excuse that it is “too late” to expand #Medicaid by ensuring matching federal funds for states regardless of when they choose to expand.The failure to act on #MedicaidExpansion has taken a toll on Alabama - hitting Alabamians hard with hospital closures spanning 10 counties already. It’s time to shed light on the true costs of refusing #MedicaidExpansion. https://t.co/lhc4zQ3PdgRead more about this commonsense legislation I introduced today here: https://t.co/wKAA6kPaIiThe Smart Choices Act would shed light on exactly how much taxpayer $$$ states have turned down by not expanding #Medicaid. I’m committed to improving health care in Alabama, and that means #MedicaidExpansion to help 200k Alabamians access care &amp; bring our tax dollars back home. https://t.co/7z7LCxytIuMaking history as the oldest living American president &amp; doing so with grace - happy birthday, @GeorgeHWBush!Glad that the Farm Bill includes a bill I joined @SenBooker &amp; @SenCapito to introduce that will improve wastewater infrastructure in rural areas. I’m looking forward to seeing this bill pass in Congress and start helping Alabamians. [2/2]Every family deserves a safe home to live in, free from the serious &amp; costly health risks of inadequate sewage systems. [1/2]Last month, @SenatorWicker, @SenHydeSmith, and I introduced legislation to commemorate Medgar Evers’ home as a national monument, which will help preserve his legacy for years to come.#OTD in 1963, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was murdered for being courageous enough to challenge the status quo.

 In his pursuit of equality and fairness, he showed us the power each of us can have when we stand up for what we believe in – and fight for it. https://t.co/CrRcg5aIaWStarted off my day w/ a group of motivated students visiting D.C. w/ the @ALRuralElectric youth tour.

 The Senate has already voted in favor of #NetNeutrality. It’s time for the House of Representatives to do the same.No one should feel that suicide is the only answer.

They have work to do, and so do we. #SantaFeThis #NationalPoliceWeek, we honor and remember the law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. We also thank the officers, and their families, who sacrifice so much to protect our communities in Alabama and across the nation every day. https://t.co/0Cuv5c8Z5kAlabamians in rural communities and small towns can’t continue to lose access to health care at this pace.

This site is a powerful recognition of the sins of the past, a reminder of how far we’ve come, and the work left to be done. https://t.co/oRXKouXEjUTomorrow is National Prescription #TakeBackDay -- bring in any unwanted/expired/unneeded medications for safe disposal at a location near you. Find your local drop-off sites here: https://t.co/jNGeTuQNcwProud to work on this bipartisan bill with @SenBooker and @SenCapito. It would help people in rural areas access the resources they need to build safe wastewater systems. Good news for the health and safety of AL families facing this tough situation. https://t.co/uwYMac6n14This morning, I sent a letter to the Int'l Trade Commission asking to testify at its July 17 hearing on newsprint tariffs that are hurting our local community newspapers. In AL, these small papers remain at the heart of their communities and we can't afford to lose them.We have a responsibility to put pressure at the state and federal level on payday lenders who are engaging in predatory tactics. But we also need to provide low income communities with the tools to lift themselves out of poverty like raising the minimum wage. #BGOVInSiteAny conversation about infrastructure has to start with broadband. For rural communities, high speed internet has the ability to change their outcomes on health care, education, and attracting job creation. #BGOVInSiteAlabama did not expand Medicaid because of politics. We've got to get health care to place that is not governed by politics because our rural communities are in desperate need for coverage. #BGOVInSiteWe got to start changing the narrative when we talk about guns. If we can get to a place where we're having a conversation, rather than an argument, we can find common ground. #BGOVInSiteOn #TaxCutsandJobsAct: In the long-term, if those deficits are real and impacting our economy, I'm afraid that folks are going to try and cut domestic programs. #BGOVInSiteEducation as a public official is a two way street. You have to do more than tell you're constituents what you're doing, you have to listen to them and the issues they're facing. #BGOVInSiteGlad to be at #BGOVInSite this morning to talk about what we're doing in the Senate and the great state of Alabama. https://t.co/roJGzNDFD6Senator Doug Jones Statement on Support for Pompeo to be Secretary of State: https://t.co/U7jFTWh71CToday I wrote a letter to Secretary Ross to explain the importance of our local newspapers and why we have to protect them. https://t.co/akHIQDiNweGreat economic and environmental news for Greenville and Sheffield. $600k grants will help these communities safely clean up and sustainably reuse contaminated properties. https://t.co/Gse01KG4u5Thanks @AlabamaCRNAs for coming by today to talk about how we can expand access to care in Alabama and to combat the opioids crisis more effectively together. https://t.co/LmYMgoyUiFStarting off today at the HELP Committee hearing on a comprehensive bipartisan bill that I’ve cosponsored to combat the opioid epidemic. Watch here: https://t.co/5iuXqGzUSw https://t.co/CdWyregtjaThanks @katiecouric and @GoldsmithB for the great conversation today and for calling me a *young* Senator. The bar might be a little low, but I’ll take the compliment. Podcast episode coming out this Thursday - tune in! https://t.co/QGZpLVyDHqHaving the tools to detect threats is critical to our national security. Proud that @AuburnU is at the forefront of the effort to accomplish this important mission. https://t.co/yAPFuSaay6Glad to meet with several of our fire chiefs from Alabama today to talk about what I can do to support them as they serve our communities. https://t.co/xb4UObEIGk$120 million economic investment + 746 news jobs at the new @AutocarTruck facility in Birmingham.

Quality early education is vital for our children's future and our economy.

On behalf of Alabama and our nation, I thank you all for your service. https://t.co/hl8fXnh9eqNext week, the FCC will take the 1st steps toward ending #netneutrality -- a move that will undermine the principles of a free and open internet.

Read more about his story here: https://t.co/IJBz0ZZPnd https://t.co/3PvT5dcbYoWish I could be there today for the make-up game, but my better half Louise will still be there to cheer on the Barons! https://t.co/o1kBOQdss7Was really looking forward to throwing the first pitch tonight, but I hope to get back for another game soon! Stay safe everyone, and keep an eye out for flash flooding during the storms. https://t.co/2irbWGzy8LFinally, I am grateful for the capable service of the Alabama airmen who supported this mission in Syria last night. To them and their families, I share my continued appreciation for their sacrifices on behalf of all of usand to do so with the assistance of our allies.  It is my hope, as General Mattis stated last night, that Assad gets the message this time and that further action, which should be done with Congressional approval, will not be necessary.Bashar al-Assad's repeated use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians -- so many of them children -- was an atrocity and must be stopped.  I fully support the President’s actions last night to strategically target Assad’s capacity to use chemical weaponsThe future of our economy is dependent on having access to a free &amp; open internet. That's why we have to work together to protect #NetNeutrality https://t.co/1n3MygkvRBDoors are now open and I'm looking forward to talking soon with folks about #netneutrality https://t.co/gcoSdRhD0IGreat to be at UWA today talking about how we can expand high speed internet access to every region in the state.

See y'all soon. #RollTide https://t.co/SfUfduAgMoToday I had a chance to talk w/CFPB's Acting Director Mick Mulvaney.

Tune in live on Weds at 10am ET/9am CT: https://t.co/5iuXqGzUSwResearch has shown that having consistent work improves the likelihood that addiction treatment will be successful. Through this job-training initiative, we are taking steps to help people thrive in recovery and break the dangerous cycle of addictionThe opioid epidemic has devastated too many families across our country and in Alabama. That’s why I joined @timkaine and @SenToddYoung today to propose a pilot program that integrates job-training with addiction recovery. https://t.co/KHjJU1Jy2WIt's not every day you get to see Coach Saban and the entire @AlabamaFTBL team at the White House ... but somehow it feels like this does happen nearly every *year* #RollTide https://t.co/zmQUoC3JPmThank you @AmeriCorpsNCCC for sending a disaster response team to Etowah County to help with ongoing tornado recovery efforts. With so many dedicated folks pitching in, I am confident our impacted communities will rebuild stronger than before!2/2: We have a duty to take action when women aren't compensated fairly for their work. That's why one of my first actions as Senator was to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairnessAct: https://t.co/emhBORMXKx1/2: Women make up half of our workforce yet they only make 80 cents for every dollar their male counterparts earn across the country. In Alabama, the #paygap is even greater. Alabama women earn 74 cents on the dollar for the same work. #equalpaydayIt was great to stop by the @hudsonalpha Institute for Biotechnology this weekend in Huntsville to hear about how they're making a positive impact on our economy &amp; advancing biotech research. https://t.co/s7Cx1CXykxCongrats Jessica! You've already made Alabama proud, but we can't wait to see what you accomplish at @WestPoint_USMA and beyond.
https://t.co/wCEdcXEUxdDr. King's influence extends to nearly every aspect of our lives today: where our children learn, where we work, and where we live. So much progress has been made in the 50 years since his death, but it's clear we've got plenty more work to do. #MLK50 https://t.co/YsZ2l2XpAVFifty years after his passing this week, we must honor Dr. King’s legacy by working to ensure our nation lives up to its creed of dignity, respect, equality and justice. #MLK50 https://t.co/xCKCGShI4eToday, I'm honored to join @uofmemphis and @EricHolder for this celebration of Dr. King's remarkable life. Fifty years after his death, his legacy lives on in the hearts of all those who continue the fight for justice and equality. #MLK50 https://t.co/rEmpY8YncuEaster is a reminder of the power of redemption and renewal. We should aspire to those values as we reflect today. From my family to yours, Happy Easter to all those celebrating.Looking forward to joining @GStephanopoulos on @ThisWeekABC tomorrow morning from Birmingham. Check your local listings and tune in: https://t.co/ndMDgvniht.We have to be able to have open conversations if we are going to find common ground.

Take steps to protect yourselves in the beginning: get multiple estimates, do your research, &amp; don't make substantial payments up front. If you suspect contracting fraud, report it here: https://t.co/g8sZGGTvd2.Linda Brown was just a child when she helped to change the course of our nation's history. The courage shown by her &amp; others in Brown v. Board of Education, helped end school segregation and set the stage for the Civil Rights Movement that followed. https://t.co/4EYemdFCtoThank you for inviting me to join you. The Oxford PD have done an outstanding job helping those affected in the wake of the storm. https://t.co/fKtVJZ78oUThis is a good step by the Administration. Congress should also go on the record about this deadly accessory by passing legislation. https://t.co/o2rC5Az9ghYesterday, we heard young people raise their voices to demand action for safer communities. Let's continue that conversation by working together to find common ground and take steps we can all agree on. Here's where I believe we can start: https://t.co/oAOioOIPweSpent time with folks in Jacksonville today who were hard hit by the tornado last week.  Such a resilient community — already working hard to rebuild even stronger! https://t.co/wFS1BTdkFF@caseyparks @Blavity @SenKamalaHarris Hi @caseyparks, the funding was included in the omnibus spending bill that was just signed into law. Thanks for asking!Proud to support this agreement which provides funding for programs that will increase access to affordable health care, help our kids get a quality education, encourage job growth, and will benefit Alabamians from Decatur to Dothan. https://t.co/8V7ImPRUlHThis is great news for Huntsville. A new, safer, and more efficient federal courthouse building is long overdue. https://t.co/6S9Fh978xWYou can watch the video here as well: https://t.co/tIPW2GXl5vHUD's proposed budget cuts programs that help support rural and urban communities alike. It also puts badly needed fixes for rural Alabama water infrastructure at risk. Read my full Q&amp;A from today's Banking Committee hearing with @SecretaryCarson here:
https://t.co/unsNNu4fAMAlabama's 15 #HBCUs are are integral to our world-class university system. Proud to say in today's omnibus spending bill we helped secure a 14% increase for both HBCUs &amp; HB grad institutions.At the end of the day, we're all Americans who are united by a bond of shared values and love of country. Let's work together to find common ground where it exists, and begin to make our country a safer place. https://t.co/CUTpoJRFKFThanks y'all for joining me for my first speech on the Senate floor. I hope we can continue the dialogue and find common ground on this important issue. We have to have the courage to seize this moment. Let's work together to make it happen.I ask all of my colleagues to consider this question – what is our collective legacy as representatives of the American people and as the members of this hallowed institution? I believe it is to leave this body and our country better than we found it. https://t.co/47GFo7gCyHWe can seize this moment by changing the conversation and our country.  

Let’s start a productive dialogue and work toward a comprehensive bill that includes ideas we should be able to agree on. There are already a half-dozen proposals in the Senate that have bipartisan support.I stand in that moment now.  So do you.  So does our country. I believe we have finally reached a tipping point regarding gun violence now.I wish I could turn back time and do something that would have prevented it altogether. Had I or anyone else had that moment, it might very well be one of those girls giving this speech today and not me.My career has been defined by prosecuting the killers of children. It was September 15, 1963, when a bomb placed outside the ladies lounge window of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham exploded, killing four beautiful young girls.https://t.co/ZGtPDApVmUWhile I know that guns and gun control are difficult issues for this country, I can tell you they’re complicated for me, too. But as a Senator, a member of the legislative branch, I have many obligations. And I believe that the 1st obligation of gov't is to protect its citizens.Those two concepts are not mutually exclusive.We must acknowledge the deadly consequences that can follow when a gun is in the wrong hands, but also recognize and respect the freedom to own and enjoy guns by law-abiding citizens as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution.In the wake of yet another mass shooting, and the rising voices of young people across the country, it is our responsibility – our duty – to have a serious discussion about guns and gun safety.  But that conversation has to be two-fold.Today, I rise to speak about an issue that has evaded broad bipartisan discussions and moderation -- an issue where folks quickly take sides and criticize anyone who disagrees. https://t.co/WGRGzUDpbwI'm headed to the Senate floor now to give my first speech! You can tune in on CSPAN2 or at this link: https://t.co/HE5VeFAmel. https://t.co/ktiGstgRhpPutting the final touches on my first Senate speech today.

To join the pilgrimage now as a United States Senator from Alabama -- and helping lead this delegation -- is very heartwarming to me.This weekend, I'll serve as co-host for the @FaithNPolitics Pilgrimage, which has become such an important part of the celebration of the Selma to Montgomery march.

My advice to you, is to do the same. You can't find common ground and you can't find solutions, if you're unwillingly to engage with folks who might not agree with you.It's so exciting to see the engagement happening across Alabama &amp; our country. We need your perspective &amp; your enthusiasm. - AL YMCA Youth Legislature. https://t.co/yl77zQb0dENothing better than spending an afternoon meeting with a whole room full of Alabama's future leaders at the YMCA Youth Legislature. https://t.co/a3MRG3iYfzRedstone Arsenal in Huntsville is home to thousands of men and women working in national defense, federal law enforcement and, yes, even space exploration.

Our adversaries, including Russia, will not stop trying to influence our elections. We must accept this reality and take steps to protect our 2018 elections immediately.What we should understand is that this isn't just about attempts to tamper with election equipment and alter ballots. It's about Russia's intention to manipulate public opinion, create chaos, and undermine the values that we share as Americans—to make us doubt our institutions.If you care about election integrity, this should absolutely get your attention. https://t.co/VFu7gxRChRI'll be visiting with folks about issues that impact our communities -- from healthcare and education to jobs and defense.Just announced my first official week-long state tour in Alabama.

Read my full statement here: https://t.co/b7T5x2sfaDThis resolution honors their sacrifice, their commitment to economic equality, and their often overlooked, but essential, contribution to the Civil Rights Movement.In 1968, after enduring years of poor working conditions and low pay, 1,300 African-American sanitation workers in Memphis risked their livelihoods and joined together to put an end to the discrimination they faced every day at their jobs.Right now on the Senate floor, I'm joining @SenAlexander to introduce a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Memphis sanitation workers' strike -- an historic event in the Civil Rights Movement.This is bipartisanship at work. Together, our Common Sense Coalition has proposed a bill that will both protect DREAMers and strengthen our borders.

Happy #FatTuesday, everyone! #AlabamaThe women who survived Rob Porter's abuse were brave to speak up. Like others who have come forward, they've inspired women who have felt ashamed and scared to share the truth. Now, it’s on the White House to step up and show leadership in protecting victims of assault.Abusers have to be held accountable and this is a moment where the White House can send that message loud and clear. I hope they step up, but as a Congress &amp; as a nation, we cannot look the other way. Today, victims have found their voices and I stand w/them to call for justice.Great speaking with my friend @JeffWVTM13 today about my 1st month in office &amp; working across the aisle to pass legislation that will help Alabama. https://t.co/vneBqAQzeMThanks for stopping by, @SpaceCampCEO!

By rejecting that bill today, and as a result of yesterday's Senate compromise, we can take action on the Senate's bipartisan bill, which is better for AL.Great meeting today with Chris Reynolds &amp; Stephen Ciccone from Toyota to discuss the new Huntsville plant &amp; how we can work together to continue growing Alabama’s booming automotive sector. https://t.co/63FTnEGmgkThis long-term funding agreement is important because it shows that bipartisan efforts work – and they are the only way we can move forward together to solve our biggest challenges. @mynbc15 https://t.co/kzgrmPDXctThis is a strong, bipartisan bill that invests Alabama’s priorities like community health centers, #CHIP &amp; our military. I encourage my colleagues in the House to pass it, so we can move forward together to address the important challenges we face. 
https://t.co/DLwA3maT5RCommunity Health Center funding expired in September 2017. Congress must reauthorize it immediately to make sure these centers can continue to serve the 9 million Americans who rely on them for health care. #RedAlert4CHCs https://t.co/RdQE1Yfrc1Great to meet with the AL Primary Health Care Association today to discuss the importance of extending funding for our vital community health centers. Funding expired in Sept 2017 — without it, 350k Alabamians are at risk of losing their access to care. https://t.co/jUNLYMQuvYLast night, I called on Senate leadership to extend funding for our Community Health Centers. If Congress doesn't act, 350k Alabamians are at risk of losing access to health care: https://t.co/Q4vDUmg1SB https://t.co/AQrNn2UE6hWe've got to do all we can do to level the playing field -- this bill is a strong step in that direction. #PaycheckFairness https://t.co/KPFHv1Z5ZhRosa Parks’ legacy lives in the progress that we’ve seen in our country. But if she was with us today, she would remind us there is still much that remains to be done. We can honor her and all those who fought for equality by continuing that work. #RosaParksDay #BlackHistoryMonthIt’s been one month since I was sworn into the US Senate. Alabama — it is a privilege to serve you and to be your voice in Washington.Happy #BlackHistoryMonth! https://t.co/d3q54gJjNCLouise and I are praying for all those impacted by today’s tragic train accident in Virginia. We’re thankful to hear our Alabama delegation is safe, and grateful for the first responders who are helping the injured.Thanks @almedassoc for inviting me to stop by today to talk about issues we all care deeply about — supporting our rural hospitals and expanding access to quality healthcare and telemedicine. https://t.co/E27XOfF5CPIt's been 5 decades since the Equal Pay Act of 1963 &amp; women still make an average of 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Proud to join my colleagues to co-sponsor The Paycheck Fairness Act. https://t.co/wYmE691MtJI’m hoping and expecting that the President will deliver a presidential address, not a campaign address…I’m hoping he’s going to reach across the aisle. #SOTU https://t.co/oCw8mDrdEMLooking forward to joining @CBSThisMorning in a few minutes to talk about what I’d like to hear in tonight’s State of the Union. #SOTU https://t.co/r9oL0v3xD4Good luck to the @ASUHornetNation @aamuedu and @milescollege marching bands! I know you'll represent Alabama well at the Battle of the Bands tomorrow. #HBOB https://t.co/uXqYDORwUpMilitary spouses serve our country in their own very important way. Thank you for all you do to support our men and women in uniform as they work hard to protect all of our families. https://t.co/LWy4l47HMeWhile I may not be as musically gifted as you two, I am a big fan of good music -- so much of which comes from Alabama's proud musical tradition. Glad to join this effort to protect our songwriters and ensure plenty more great music for years to come. https://t.co/QLBfUms07KIt was great to meet with these Alabamians today who are committed to supporting at-risk youth through mentorship programs. Welcome to DC and keep up the great work on behalf of Alabama’s kids. https://t.co/CSZXeLMWP8Thanks for the great conversation — and the coffee! https://t.co/zQilNosV14@SenDuckworth Congratulations! Louise and I wish you and your family the very best. We can’t wait to meet the new baby soon!Tune in tomorrow morning to @MorningEdition on @NPR at 7am ET / 6am CT where I’ll be talking about the way forward after the shutdown and how Senate moderates are working together to find common ground. See you in the morning, @NPRinskeep.The Senate still needs to pass a long-term funding plan that addresses the many critical issues facing our nation, but I'm pleased to announce we were able to rise above partisan politics and find consensus: https://t.co/5Bycn3xKi0Headed to more bipartisan talks this morning with @timkaine and @JeffFlake. We’re working to find common ground and end the #shutdown immediately. https://t.co/7lZo1Iibm9I've participated in discussions w/ colleagues from both sides that have focused on finding a bipartisan path forward to keep the gov't operating. I'm encouraged by the comments made by @SenateMajLdr acknowledging our efforts &amp; the broad interest in finding common groundToday I called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hold a vote on a measure to ensure U.S. military Service-members and their families will continue to be paid during the federal government shutdown: https://t.co/S5KFMQAE6WAround the world and here at home, our military and their families continue to serve during the #shutdown. @SenateMajLdr should stop blocking @clairecmc’s bill -which I cosponsored - that ensures they will still get paid for their sacrifices on our behalf.A functioning American government isn’t negotiable. We need to find common ground to end this shutdown immediately. I’ll be working every day until we get the gov’t running again, so we can get back to the important work our constituents expect us to do."Because of CHIP and the many families in Alabama and around our country that would be put in jeopardy by a government shutdown, I felt compelled to vote yes." -Senator Jones statement on the federal government shutdown. https://t.co/a9YJhVJG9GI couldn’t agree more, @SenateMajLdr. Kids aren’t a political bargaining chip. But the rest of my message was that Congress should have renewed CHIP months ago. https://t.co/4U7qsmg4a4“In Alabama like many rural states, our rural health care is disappearing. 
We need to work together to address immediate health care needs for people in those communities.” https://t.co/XWGJEcAsxFSen.

We are grateful for the legacy he built as he served the communities of Lee and Russell, and our state, with honor and integrity for more than 20 years. https://t.co/LEV4qvFzFPToday I signed on to protect #NetNeutrality. It's the right thing to do for Alabama consumers &amp; our small businesses. https://t.co/Ggtoat8rh2“We have a responsibility to continue fighting for the American dream, Dr. King’s dream … to ensure that we live up to the ideas of equality &amp; justice … it means that children growing up in every community should have the same opportunities to succeed.” https://t.co/8q0bGHJi13More than 150k Alabama children depend on #CHIP. Let's do right by them and pass the Keep Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act. https://t.co/3rrz8zWtK1"The challenge should not just be on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Day. The challenge is working everyday to ensure every Alabamian &amp; every American has an equal opportunity for success." - 2018 MLK Wreath Laying Ceremony at Kelly Ingram Park https://t.co/eXm5I90X1d"We must use this moment to do more than just remember those who came before us. To truly honor their legacies, we must continue to do as Dr. King would do, and reject hatred, violence and fear. We need to listen and learn from one another." - Senator Jones"Together, we have a responsibility to continue fighting for the American Dream and to honor the legacy of those who came before us by working to ensure Alabama, and our nation, live up to the ideas of equality and justice that we hold so dear." - Senator Jones"For more than three decades, these breakfasts have served as an opportunity for people to come together to remember the sacrifices made by so many in the ongoing struggle for equality and opportunity." - Senator JonesSenator Jones joins the city of Birmingham for the 32nd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Unity Breakfast https://t.co/k53GyGNFDoDidn't have much luck this morning but it was great seeing sunrise over the ridge in Bibb County. https://t.co/HRSeKctmeOSenator Jones is live on @WBRCgoodday discussing his 1st co-sponsored bill which funds #CHIP &amp; protects healthcare for 150k Alabama kids. https://t.co/4lizqwSDss#TuneIn to the Senator on @WIAT42 w/ Art Franklin as they discuss his support of #CHIP legislation &amp; the importance of the Toyota/Mazda plant for Alabama. https://t.co/upDZvnUPAbI've said all along to that my top priority was to protect the children who depend on #CHIP. Today I'm proud to announce the 1st bill I'll co-sponsor does just that: https://t.co/PX8RXVdTT3Today's announcement that Toyota/Mazda will invest $1.4B to create 4k new jobs sends a message to companies everywhere that Alabama is open for business https://t.co/f5rggnbrgIToday marks one week since @SenTinaSmith and I were sworn in as United States Senators.
