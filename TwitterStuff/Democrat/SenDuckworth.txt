The reality is that the Trump administration is choosing to rip children &amp; infants away from their parents and then holding them hostage. They may think it's a political winner or a game, but they're playing with innocent children's livesPay attention when you hear this, because it‚Äôs the Trump administration admitting that the reason they‚Äôre doing this is because they want to send a message.

His nominee to be @CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has done much worse (incl directly supervising the torture of detainees &amp; helping destroy video evidence of those abuses)Rather than taking serious steps to ensure stability or fill our diplomatic corps, once again Donald Trump has chosen chaos over the kind of leadership the American people desperately need and deserveIt‚Äôs troubling that Donald Trump‚Äôs reaction to Tillerson‚Äôs support of a close American ally facing threats from Russia was to fire him https://t.co/UMQBieOCEbHappy #GirlScoutDay!
