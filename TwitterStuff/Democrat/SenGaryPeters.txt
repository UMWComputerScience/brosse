Meanwhile, Congressional Rs are boarding charter buses to celebrate tax cuts for corporations &amp; CEO’s https://t.co/UfxEZYMLd1Republicans are saying corporate tax cuts will raise wages. Here’s why that’s not true. https://t.co/bLrAa2jcSmIn 1986, our last major tax reform bill passed Senate 97-3 after 36 days of public hearings over 10 months. 
 
This time? The bill was written completely behind closed doors, no input from Democrats, and is being rushed to meet an artificial, self-imposed deadline. (5/5)GOP tax bill blows $1.4 trillion hole in our deficit, leaving our children and grandchildren to foot the bill while hamstringing long-term funding for our military, Medicare &amp; Social Security (4/5)Health care costs for middle class families will go up &amp; number of insured will increase by 13 million. For the sickest Americans, health insurance costs could make coverage simply unattainable (3/5)This bill overwhelmingly favors the wealthy &amp; corporations with permanent tax cuts that CEO’s admit will go to shareholders  -  not passed down to workers. Since the Senate passed its version, $70 billion of stock buybacks have already been announced. (2/5)THREAD: The Senate is set to vote on the Republican tax bill tonight. I can’t support this plan b/c it’s not a good deal for Michigan middle class families (1/5)No stamp can do justice to the beauty of  @SleepingBearNPS, but glad people across the country will be able to enjoy even a small part of this Michigan treasure https://t.co/WHOsSZKrovProud to join my colleagues in introducing a resolution to restore #NetNeutrality protections and fight against the FCC’s decision that harms MI families and small businesses who rely on open internet access https://t.co/v21K476e5OThe Senate has had 3 bipartisan hearings on fish &amp; Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization. But we’ve had zero hearings on the Republican tax bill. Fisheries are important, but c’mon folks...It would be unconscionable to rip health care away from children during the most formative years of their life &amp; increase costs for working families trying to keep their kids healthy. #ExtendCHIP https://t.co/cdNX4OOwabUniversities &amp; companies across MI are creating new jobs &amp; developing the next big thing in transportation. Once self-driving cars can operate in Michigan snow &amp; ice, then we’ll know they are truly ready for anything! https://t.co/YzoJ2YHlhtI completely oppose the FCC’s vote to scrap #NetNeutrality and stand with the thousands of Michiganders who called my office opposing this anti-consumer decision https://t.co/GwsF1yqSzx@jbarro FYI, I'm the one with the beard https://t.co/MOS2HP7gAaLet me be clear – repealing #NetNeutrality is…
 
❌ Anti-innovation
 
❌ Anti- competition
 
❌ Anti- consumer https://t.co/tZyG1g5z2SMI is taking another step forward as the world leader in auto innovation with the opening of @acmwillowrun! Companies &amp; researchers from around the world will test self-driving cars here in MI to get them ready for our roads https://t.co/YNRlZYe3R4If #NetNeutrality is rolled back, large corporations that can pay for internet fast lanes will have unfair advantages over small businesses and startups that are the backbone of American economy https://t.co/epygdjKLB1Wishing my friends in the Michigan Jewish community a #HappyHanukkah May these nights be filled with light and celebrationStartups create millions of new jobs every year. Eliminating #NetNeutrality protections will limit small businesses’ ability to take risks and share innovative ideas with the world https://t.co/JJJAmtmO7rEnough is enough - Congress needs to #ExtendCHIP now &amp; ensure that more than 100,000 children of Michigan’s working families will still have health care next year. https://t.co/tBjhqnYIQdThe wait was far too long, but the award is much deserved.

For over 60 years, you’ve battled on the frontlines to protect workers’ rights, improve workplace safety, and help all Americans access health care and retire with dignity. T/y for all that you have doneBecause of that, my colleagues and I are calling on the FCC to delay its 12/14 vote to eliminate these crucial protections. Something as important as #NetNeutrality should not be dismantled through a flawed, compromised process. https://t.co/7fqZWg6nNwYou can’t make this up: fake comments from bots may be drowning out voices of real consumers calling for #NetNeutrality protections, and thousands of complaints seemingly disappeared from the FCC’s record. https://t.co/HHvhmd4HjXSandy Levin has been a mentor &amp; role model for me, his dedication to public service will be missed in Congress &amp; SE Michigan. Sandy’s lasting legacy will be his commitment to improving the lives of working people. My full statement on his retirement: https://t.co/ai4P1suuFOThe Senate had an opportunity to craft bipartisan tax reform that truly focused on middle class families &amp; helped to raise wages. Instead, the GOP rammed through a bill written behind closed doors that will force our children to foot the bill for their financially reckless planOur tax code should be fairer, simpler &amp; fiscally responsible. Unfortunately the bill passed this morning adds over $1 trillion to nat’l debt to pay for permanent corporate cuts that benefit wealthy shareholders- w/ middle class families only receiving small, temporary tax breaks@UM_DCOffice Thank youAlways enjoy getting a visit to my DC office from @mayorbliss and hearing about the great things happening in @CityGrandRapids. Thanks for stopping by! https://t.co/TXRF5PfLMYEven under the rosiest projections, the #GOPTaxPlan would still add over $1 trillion to the national Debt. That is not fiscally conservative, it’s fiscally irresponsible.For many working families, the #GOPTaxPlan means a change of less than $100 per year – that is not a middle class tax cut. https://t.co/38ecClFmX8CEO’s and the @federalreserve chair agree: #GOPTaxPlan will boost corporate shareholders, not workers’ wages. https://t.co/w0LBIDTwGC https://t.co/oH2ImcCrcnHeaded to the floor right now to speak out for tax reform that is fair, simple and fiscally responsible.
