The Bristol Police do a tremendous job on land &amp; water, &amp; this new boat can help them quickly &amp; effectively respond to a variety of marine emergencies. https://t.co/EynOCGCZ7TPres Trump wants another 1 percent for the richest 1 percent. 100 percent irresponsible.

https://t.co/CawU4SpUToThe U.S. Senate voted to honor the late Army 1st Sgt P. Andrew McKenna, a courageous &amp; decorated Green Beret who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, by passing legislation to name a U.S. Post Office in Bristol as the “First Sergeant P. Andrew McKenna Jr. Post Office.” https://t.co/Kg4i6c91kkPres Trump keeps choosing Putin’s word over the US intelligence community’s &amp; giving Kremlin a green light to undermine U.S. democracy &amp; elections. It needs to stop. But will continue as long as GOP majority in Congress goes along.My statement on Justice Kennedy’s retirement &amp; the fight to #SaveSCOTUS: https://t.co/PWldC7ezoAReminder: EVERY American benefits from the work of Unions: Minimum wage – #Union. Safer workplace – #Union. Overtime – #Union.  Fair treatment on the job – #Union. While the nature of work has changed over time, the need for organized labor hasn't.Everyone should have the right to a safe workplace, fair wages, decent benefits, &amp; the ability to organize &amp; have their voices heard. Unions uplift living standards for everyone. Today's SCOTUS #Janus decision makes it a heavier lift for workers, but America is still #UnionStrongToday, 5 Republican-appointed Justices acknowledged the President’s rhetoric unfairly singled out one religion, but still upheld his #MuslimBan. Today it’s Muslims, tomorrow it could be your religion. My statement: https://t.co/ziuwWP3dJ7Americans shouldn’t have to pay an age tax, but the Trump Admin’s policies are forcing Americans age 50 to 64 to start paying higher health premiums &amp; weakening protections for all people w/ preexisting conditions. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/xvfAfaZdmxThree years ago today, the Supreme Court upheld the #ACA as #Constitutional. We must fight efforts to sabotage people's #healthcare &amp; continue working to ensure more Americans can purchase affordable health insurance &amp; improve the way health care is delivered. #ProtectOurCareBreaking ground on new @GDElectricBoat #submarine manufacturing facilities at @QuonsetRI.

This is another example of Trump Admin prioritizing offshore oil &amp; gas drilling interests ahead of public health &amp; #marinelife.After falsely claiming he couldn’t end family separations, Pres Trump reversed himself. But his latest policy is still costly &amp; ineffective. Trump Admin must immediately take steps to reunite these kids &amp; their parents &amp; stop using family internment as a political bargaining chipThanks to the folks at @PanCAN @PanCANRI for your tireless work to push for research funding to accelerate breakthroughs, improve patient care, &amp; #DemandBetter in the fight against #PancreaticCancer. #PANCAware https://t.co/wFZHaD6G3gPresident Trump chose to cruelly &amp; forcibly separate immigrant families at the border.

https://t.co/Fow0dwEqQuChag sameach, happy Easter, and a peaceful and joyful weekend to all!While a delay is helpful, it's disappointing that Pres.

https://t.co/nc1Q3ztCjYToday, the head of U.S. Cyber Command admitted that Pres Trump still has NOT directed him to disrupt Russian election hacking operations where they originate.

https://t.co/vJ5r423tQWCongress must lift the ban on federally funded gun violence research. Scientific research, facts, &amp; evidence can help us produce effective, evidence-based solutions to prevent &amp; reduce #gunviolence. Nobody should be afraid of facts &amp; data.The NRA represents itself &amp; gun industry. The 2nd amendment is safe without the NRA. Truth is: there are sensible steps we can take to strengthen gun safety laws, improve background checks, &amp; protect public health.

https://t.co/dPl3YjzLPySome House Republicans are proposing a false-choice, defense-only, lopsided approach to gov't spending that could damage our economy, hurt working families, &amp; leave our country less safe. That makes no sense and it's a non-starter in the Senate.

Restoring net neutrality should be a bipartisan priority. So far, 50 US Senators are on board. We need at least 51 to win the vote in the Senate. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/z3krbXNvR4ONE VOTE AWAY: We are close to overruling Trump Admin on #netneutrality in the Senate. So far, every Senate Democrat &amp; 1 Republican supports restoring net neutrality. Urge Republicans to protect your internet freedom &amp; consumer rights.

https://t.co/Og5xhjM9PBIt was my honor to help recognize June Guglielmi for her 50 years in education and 27 years teaching at North Scitutate Elementary. Ms. Guglielmi has made significant contributions to the students, school district, &amp; community. We salute her! https://t.co/i4PcbKSb1jGreat to be in Olneyville today kicking off 6-10 Reconstruction Project w/ @GovRaimondo @Jorge_Elorza @RIDOTNews &amp; others. This is a smart investment that will improve highway safety &amp; traffic flow &amp; spur new opportunities for economic development in the area.Due to Winter Storm Grayson, my Cranston and Providence offices are currently closed. However, my Washington, DC office is open and ready to assist you. Stay safe!Kids shouldn't be forced to deal w/ freezing classrooms. Public schools are crucial to our nation's future &amp; must be included in our nat'l infrastructure strategy. I intro’ed the School Building Improvement Act (S.1674) to help communities fix schools. https://t.co/emShUYuGPsWith severe winter weather approaching, I want everyone to stay safe &amp; warm. Now is a good time to plan ahead &amp; make sure you have an #emergencykit w/ essential items to meet your needs. https://t.co/OmNn3tDb84 #emergencypreparednessParticularly when it's this cold, there is even more of a need to help our most vulnerable citizens.

#MerryChristmas2017Merry Christmas to all the moms and dads out there who are still up working, and who work hard every day to help make our communities and our country a better place for all!   #MerryChristmasOn behalf of students, seniors, working families &amp; Main Street businesses who are the heart &amp; soul of our country and the backbone of our communities, I am voting NO on fiscally irresponsible #GOPTaxScam. 
https://t.co/zTp6r86DLiI oppose #TrumpTax bill because it is unfair and irresponsible.  It is an historic transfer of wealth from students, seniors, and working families to multi-national corporations and wealthy estates. #GOPTaxScamIf GOP prioritized tax cuts for #middleclass &amp; Main Street businesses, we could have passed bipartisan #taxreform to simplify #taxcode &amp; strengthen our economy. Instead, GOP rushed this #trickledown tax scheme through with a reckless disregard for facts &amp; independent analysis.https://t.co/7HxNFJbrkVOur hearts go out to the victims and families of the Amtrak accident in Dupont, Washington. Grateful to first responders. I will closely follow the NTSB investigation into this matter and continue advocating for needed infrastructure investments and safety improvements.https://t.co/JQTKWG2aSEGetting set to join RI delegation, pediatricians, &amp; children's health advocates at @MeetingStreetRI to urge GOP to #ExtendCHIP to ensure health coverage for all children. #FundCHIPNow Watch live at: https://t.co/qppTMahUaOThe #GOPTaxScam is an American job killer!

It's larded w/ incentives for corporations that ship American jobs overseas. But it eliminates tax relief working families rely on to help pay for college, health care, retirement, etc.

https://t.co/5WP0HT3RsuSchool districts from coast to coast need help to fix and build schools. Instead of  #GOPTaxScam, we need a federal infrastructure bill that includes real funding to help improve schools. That’s why I’ve introduced the School Building Improvement Act.

https://t.co/WPHuuRbudtFCC vote to repeal #NetNeutrality could be start of more restrictive access to the Internet. We can’t let that happen. Congress can overturn this decision &amp; ensure the Internet remains open &amp; free. Contact your Sens. Tell them to support a CRA invalidating FCC’s ruling. https://t.co/OsR44YjDJBThe Trump Admin just voted to repeal #NetNeutrality. But this isn't over. 
 
We will work in Congress to invalidate the #FCC’s action &amp; keep the Internet open &amp; free for all.
 
The vast majority of Americans support Net Neutrality. 3 FCC votes will not change that.5 years later &amp; our hearts still ache for #Newtown. These kids should be sitting in their 6th grade classrooms today w/ their teachers, but their lives were cut short by #gunviolence. Congress needs to act &amp; it can start by ending federal ban on gun violence research. #SandyHook https://t.co/nzlPnAdDEvIt’s not too late.  Tell the Trump Admin not to repeal #NetNeutrality. The Internet should be open to all…
https://t.co/BBKbMjBgPuhttps://t.co/zq3DykmjPNYou can’t make this stuff up: After calls from Pres Trump’s wealthy friends, Republicans will alter the corporate rate in #GOPTaxScam... to provide an extra tax cut for the wealthiest individuals. #ScroogeWouldBeProud #GOPShouldBeAshamed
