We need that again in 2018. If you‚Äôre worried about protecting the Mueller investigation, it‚Äôs time to make your voice heard in Congress NOW‚Äîbefore it‚Äôs too late.The ultimate goal‚Äîand the huge danger to our democracy‚Äîis for Trump to get Republicans in Congress to help slow or shut down this investigation, and to do so soon, before Mueller can get to the bottom of Trump's own activities.Now, @realDonaldTrump is bullying the Justice Department into making highly sensitive information about an ongoing investigation available to Congressman Nunes, who has a demonstrated intent and history of abusing information to undermine the investigation.Trump and shameless allies like Nunes are trying to paint the Mueller investigation as a frivolous, politically-motivated ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù with no end. But this is a serious investigation that‚Äôs already indicted 19 people and delivered 5 guilty pleas.THREAD: Something very dangerous is happening right now. @realDonaldTrump is trying to make the Mueller investigation into just another partisan political battle, to downplay its significance &amp; keep Americans from uniting against any wrongdoing that might be uncovered.We face real threats around the world, but I don‚Äôt think the American people want an endless, ever-expanding war. We need to take war-making off autopilot and put in place a framework that makes Congress do its job, even if it‚Äôs difficult. https://t.co/cqaKfKpizAClimate chaos is having a major impact in Colorado ‚Äì shrinking snowpack is hurting agriculture, water supply, and $5 billion ski industry.
