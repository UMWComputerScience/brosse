“With reasonable men, I will reason; with humane men I will plead; but to tyrants I will give no quarter,” – William Lloyd Garrison
 
The people of Massachusetts are ready to fight for justice for the children and parents on the border, and against the hate of Donald Trump. https://t.co/vRZUE5c0t0The humanitarian crisis created by Trump’s cruel zero tolerance policy is far from over. This weekend, I’m heading to the border to tour detention facilities and deliver hand-made cards from Massachusetts children to detained children and families.
https://t.co/qTAx0umcp1Families should stay #TogetherAndFree. Today, I’m joining some of the most organized and energized activists in the country in Boston to send Donald Trump a special message from Massachusetts – we won’t back down. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/6qXATDnsQiIf you couldn't attend last night's Climate Crisis Action Summit or missed the livestream you can watch the full event here: https://t.co/zdIHhoCgPS https://t.co/3QamljdPrKThe House resolution to restore #NetNeutrality is now up to 175 supporters! Momentum continues to grow. Thank you @RepPeteAguilar, @RepStephMurphy, @RepTerriSewell.And a special thank you to our amazing guests @GinaEPA, @tsterndc, and @Jpholdren who delivered rousing calls to action. https://t.co/itDZtquoNoThank you to everyone who came out to last night’s incredible Climate Crisis Action Summit in Belmont #MA. The people of Massachusetts are ready to return to their revolutionary roots and fight Donald Trump’s war on clean energy and our climate! https://t.co/zgsaz3rW7TThe clean energy revolution is a blue-collar job revolution. It’s the greatest force for blue-collar job creation in a generation. #ClimateActionCoal is losing because it can’t compete with renewables in the free market – it’s not conspiracy, it’s competition. In 2016, we created as many jobs in #solar energy as exist in the coal industry today – 50,000. #ClimateActionThe Republicans have a pretty clear agenda when it comes to #ClimateChange and clean energy: Deny, Delay, and Defund. So my approach is Fight, Fight, and Fight. #ClimateActionIf President Trump is waging an assault on clean energy and our climate, then we have to fight back.
 
We have to fight in Congress, in the courts, and in the streets with grassroots activism. #ClimateActionStarting soon: join me and the nation’s leading climate experts for a summit on one of the greatest crisis of our time: climate change. You can watch live here at 7 PM ET: https://t.co/R1nkb54CPNHart Senate Office Building is filled with ferocious and inspiring protestors right now because when families are being torn apart at the border, Americans come together to defend them. You can’t ask for freedom, you have to fight for it. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/G45eP0WRUqTONIGHT: Join me and the nation’s leading climate experts in Belmont #MA for a summit on one of the greatest crises of our time: climate change.

The Senate should not consider ANY Supreme Court nominee until after the midterm elections.#RoevWade is the law of the land and must remain the law of the land. Supreme Court vacancy or not.We are now 132 days away from the 2018 election. When Republicans committed to stealing Merrick Garland’s #SCOTUS seat, we were 269 away.Trump got a weaker deal with fewer commitments than any of his predecessors, and it is no surprise #NorthKorea is already taking advantage of its ambiguity. Congress is ready to step in to tighten the screws even if the President is not. https://t.co/QYsKIo8JZNThe 5-4 #SCOTUS #Janus decision may not be as high-profile as the #MuslimBan but it’s another big win for the right-wing in its decades-long war on the working class. The billionaires who want to lower wages and bust unions scored a major victory today.
https://t.co/n12IkQ3dTYIt’s disappointing that the SCOTUS Majority believes the First Amendment protects deception &amp; lies at the expense of women’s reproductive health. Despite today’s ruling, I’ll still work to #EndTheLies &amp; protect access to comprehensive women’s health care.

Has your representative signed the petition to #SaveTheInternet? Check here: https://t.co/zKI7sxSwGjToday, people are swarming Capitol Hill asking House Reps to support the movement to save #NetNeutrality. Comcast/Verizon/AT&amp;T/Charter and #BigTelco are relying on us to forget. Don't! The fight is still on and we can win!  #SaveTheInternetA Republican-controlled Senate steals a #SCOTUS seat &amp; confirms an archconservative Justice to a bench that is now enshrining Donald Trump’s legacy of hate with 5-4 decisions like today’s upholding his Muslim ban. This is the end result of a process that starts at the ballot box.This would be a welcome development - if it happens and actually lowers the threat. We must not let false concessions distract us, especially today, on the anniversary of the North Korean invasion of the South in 1950.

Thanks to everyone who came out to today’s town hall. https://t.co/BDqnkyl4ZRWelcome news about the reunion of families separated for decades by the Korean War. I hope #NorthKorea follows through on returning the remains of U.S. soldiers as well.
https://t.co/kQexLIbSI1The toxic stress children can experience after being separated from their parents can set them up for a lifetime of adverse health outcomes. Today, I met with Boston area doctors to discuss the impact Trump’s #FamilySeparation policy has had on children’s health. https://t.co/c2Cerpo5ZlPolice need a warrant to search an individual’s home, and that will now be the standard for mobile phone location records, as well. SCOTUS today updated the 4th amendment for the 21st century digital world.
https://t.co/o6ArdizVrRJust as we have, Donald Trump has seen the images and heard the children crying. But to him, they’re fake news because he doesn’t recognize migrants as real people. He has dehumanized them and wants you to do the same. Don’t. The suffering he has created is real and must end. https://t.co/BpeYSGehCBOur veterans deserve the best health care -- and full transparency from the VA. The VA must stop concealing important data such as rates of infection and injury and release all of this information so we can hold the agency fully accountable.

Here’s to another 50 of standing up for consumers. https://t.co/KdO0Gsupxz“Nice” internment camps are still internment camps. Children don’t belong there. https://t.co/70p4N3R4uyThe border crisis that Trump created is not over. Thousands of families may be imprisoned indefinitely, possibly in military-style internment camps. Thousands of children remain separated from their parents. 

How we respond will define the character of each and every one of us.The zero-tolerance policy is an anti-immigrant dragnet. We can only assume this executive order would imprison children in the same correctional facilities as their parents. They will be sleeping in cages instead of cribs.

Families and children don’t belong in jail. Period.Trump’s executive order doesn’t end the zero-tolerance policy of prosecuting anyone and everyone who crosses the border improperly, it reaffirms it. This evening, I’ll be on the Senate floor speaking out against this cruel policy. Watch here: https://t.co/5VtsjvFSTuThe weakening of California’s #NetNeutrality bill shows what the forces we are facing are capable of. Every state deserves gold standard rules. That’s why the House of Reps should pass my CRA resolution immediately to reinstate net neutrality nationally.
https://t.co/6daLeVsN7gThe executive order doesn't end the zero-tolerance policy that created this crisis. In fact, the President now wants to detain parents and children together indefinitely, and contemplates DoD building internment camps to house them. This is no solution to a problem Trump created.Declaring June National Ocean Month is a nice sheen on Trump’s ocean policy, but between opening up 90% of our coasts to offshore drilling and now repealing the #NationalOceanPolicy, his admin is doing everything it can to allow another BP oil spill.
https://t.co/LlAoUfVPIyPresident Trump’s leadership may be devoid of compassion and humanity, but the American people are not. On #WorldRefugeeDay, we should each promise ourselves to do everything we can to fight for the safety and dignity of the most vulnerable.Fleeing violence and seeking asylum is not illegal.

Ripping babies away from mothers doesn’t make our country safe and secure.

You are entirely to blame for this. And entirely capable of ending it right now. 

#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/HBpuakc1JRLive now! https://t.co/2pHch2DpQqEnough is enough. I’m asking for a ruling on whether the family separation policy is subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) process. If it is, @SenateDems can force a vote to end this policy with 30 signatures and pass it with a simple majority. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/qjZ2NFgqQIWithdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council is Donald Trump’s way of building a wall around the entirety of our country, not just at the southern border. This decision is yet another example of Trump’s fixation on asserting his rights rather than protecting the rights of others. https://t.co/owl2iIi0ET#NetNeutrality is the free speech issue of our time. At 4:25 ET, I’ll be on @washingtonpost’s @postlive with a great panel discussing what the repeal means for speech on the internet. You can watch LIVE here:
https://t.co/FuHQwUgbmL https://t.co/BR1OvD7bKhThe #AlzheimersStamp has raised an incredible $404,000 for @NIH-funded research since November 30th. Thank you to all who have joined the fight to Stamp Out Alzheimer’s. So proud to be a part of this effort and others like it to find a cure and #EndALZ. https://t.co/71SamnPLGTHealth and Human Services expects to take in 250 children at the border today. And tomorrow. And every day for the next two months. This is unconscionable. If Trump refuses to end this, Congress must by passing the #KeepFamilesTogether Act TODAY.
https://t.co/Wb6SnkgcXGIt would take Donald Trump basically the same amount of effort to end the heinous family separation policy as it did to pardon Joe Arpaio. #KeepFamiliesTogetherThe California State Senate is considering a bill that would set gold standard #NetNeutrality rules. But internet providers are working hard to weaken it. California lawmakers need to stay strong; everyone is watching. 
https://t.co/g0lsVGqHUDThe missions of the Space Force can be accomplished through other services, mainly the Air Force. Our Generals don’t even want it. In the context of a Trump vanity project, this is an especially bad idea, but even in a vacuum a Space Force is wasteful and unnecessary. https://t.co/HJf9GzWQRzIn 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen warned us of the dangers #climatechange would pose in the future. 30 years later, it is the future. Climate change is here. Three decades after we saw the terrible truth, we must recommit to acting on climate change.
https://t.co/alxfrVRbPuThis is a lie. There is no law. There is no court mandate. This is a policy made solely by this administration, and you can stop it right now. And every second you don’t you are directly responsible for unimaginable amounts of misery.  Period. https://t.co/nf0lF9VEoOFrom revolutionizing cancer treatment to addressing the #OpioidCrisis , #MA is leading the way in advancing the science necessary to tackle the most challenging #healthcare issues of our time. @NIH investments in MA today are helping to create the treatments &amp; cures of tomorrow. https://t.co/21XmQ7j8xIWe don’t want ICE using our local law enforcement officers to do its dirty work. Our local law enforcement wants to promote community safety, not undermine it by terrorizing immigrants.  
https://t.co/s5aI2K8ZOEThe horrifying stories of immigrants in America under Donald Trump are a disgrace to our nation. The “zero tolerance” family separation is a new low in inhumanity for this administration. #KeepFamiliesTogether
https://t.co/Z7SWsRo6iWDonald Trump has more respect and sympathy for homicidal tyrant Kim Jong Un than for the parents and children being ripped apart at the border. https://t.co/v2Omw1j3caSeparating families at the border is immoral and inhumane. I’m with leaders of our immigrant, refugee, and faith communities speaking out against the cruel “zero-tolerance policy” and discussing legislation that will #KeepFamiliesTogether. Watch here: https://t.co/nLEhqsfJkt https://t.co/MmtDcTXAtoThere is no law that requires the Trump administration to separate families. There is no court decision that mandates this. The decision to implement the barbaric “zero tolerance” policy is one the administration made on its own. https://t.co/TjuHw0aWQwThe @UN said as many as 250,000 people could be killed in this offensive. 18,000,000 Yemenis could be at risk of starvation by the end of the year. America must end its support of Saudi Arabia’s war in #Yemen. 
https://t.co/p8gfyLQ9L3An estimated 18 billion unwanted calls were placed in the U.S. in 2017 — that’s a 76% increase over the previous year.

Robocalls suck. That’s why Rep. @FrankPallone and I have introduced legislation to put an end to abusive robocall practices. 

https://t.co/pYPqVwS90p“I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America,” - John Kelly when he ran DHS. The policy of separating families is designed to make coming to America such a traumatizing experience that migrants would rather choose to endure violence in their home country. https://t.co/RF6Ba0xiLESeparating children from their parents as a form of punishment is barbaric. Prosecuting parents seeking asylum is medieval. We all have a moral obligation to take a stand against these horrors. #FamiliesBelongTogetherA new @Nature study shows that Antarctica is melting faster than ever and has lost 3 TRILLION tons of ice since 1992. This isn’t Earth’s natural cycle. Humans are causing climate change and only we can do something about it, but we must do it NOW.
https://t.co/WeiWZ6SbcWAfter school programs are excellent, but what happens during summer vacation? Families need affordable, high quality child care options in the summer months too. That’s why I cosponsored the Child Care for Working Families Act that will provide parents and kids with #SummerCare.Glad you agree. So you should have no problem with Congress passing my OPEC Accountability Act that instructs you to negotiate with OPEC, Russia and China and take action against any country that refuses to stop manipulating oil markets. https://t.co/mjG9jypRZbLast month, @realDonaldTrump quietly proposed gutting the rights of federal employees because, as he claimed, the bureaucracy was teeming with “waste, fraud, and abuse.”
 
If Trump is serious about ending the abuse of government resources, there’s an obvious place to start. https://t.co/hTZh3Qip3JKim Jong Un has the ability to vaporize hundreds of thousands of Americans and his regime has repeatedly expressed its desire to do so. A handshake hasn’t changed that. https://t.co/aYZK1rNQOrI’ll be on @MSNBC on @allinwithchris tonight talking #NorthKorea and today’s AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger ruling. Tune in at 8:15pm ET!SOON: With the #TrumpKimSummit behind us, I’ll be on @CNN with @WolfBlitzer at 6pm ET discussing the #NorthKorea negotiations and where we go from here. Tune in.The AT&amp;T-Time Warner ruling underscores the need for #NetNeutrality rules.

AT&amp;T will be free to block, slowdown, or charge fees to competitors like Netflix &amp; Hulu to favor their own DirecTV Now streaming service &amp; HBO content. @SpeakerRyan must hold a vote on #NetNeutrality NOW.Don’t let Scott Pruitt’s ethics scandals distract you, because they’re not distracting him from executing his agenda of dismantling even the most basic public health protections like keeping antifreeze chemicals &amp; paint strippers out of our drinking water.
https://t.co/OYkZuCWeGU.@realDonaldTrump wants $65 million for a new low-yield nuclear weapon that the military did not request and will make the world more dangerous. I’m introducing an amendment to the NDAA to cancel that program and put those funds toward nonproliferation activities in #NorthKorea. https://t.co/PhZVBShToDThis could be a death sentence for many. America has a long and proud history of providing protection to those fleeing violence, but the Trump administration is treating asylum seekers as if safety is too much to ask for.
 
https://t.co/1Zn2HieXxf6 months ago, the pundits &amp; lobbyists said my CRA was DOA in the Senate. Dems wouldn’t come together; Republicans wouldn’t cross the aisle; we didn’t have a chance. They were wrong.

I'm convinced we're going to keep proving the skeptics wrong &amp; save #NetNeutrality in the House.LIVE: As #NetNeutrality rules are rolled back today, I’m on the Senate floor calling for the American people to keep fighting for the free and open internet. 

We can still #SaveTheInternet. Watch here: https://t.co/nLEhqsfJkt https://t.co/5gApZhHth4I urge @SpeakerRyan to take an immediate vote on the resolution to restore #NetNeutrality. Until that happens, we will continue to demonstrate in the streets, write letters, make calls, sign petitions, and harness the power of social media.

This fight is far from over.The American people know they cannot trust their internet service providers to do the right thing and protect a free and open internet. That’s why we need strict #NetNeutrality rules in place.

#SaveTheInternetThere will be no eulogy for the free and open internet today. @AjitPaiFCC will not have the last word on #NetNeutrality, the American people will. Your representative needs to know how you feel about #NetNeutrality TODAY.

#SaveTheInternetThe repeal of #NetNeutrality officially goes into effect today, but the fight is far from over.

The people saying we can’t pass the resolution to #SaveTheInternet in the House are the same people who were saying we couldn't do it in the Senate.

Ignore them. Just keep fighting.Trump must understand this going into the #SingaporeSummit: there are 28K US soldiers on the DMZ. 250K Americans live within 10 miles. In a new conflict, US casualties would exceed those of the first Korean War in just a few days.

There is no military solution. Diplomacy works.WATCH: I’ll be on @FaceTheNation this morning discussing the #TrumpKimSummit as they arrive in Singapore.

To successfully transition back to their communities after their sentences, they need drug treatment. 7 of my colleagues and I are asking @USGAO to examine treatment programs offered at correctional facilities. https://t.co/JYV1CJJVJGCongress should pass my MASS Act that incentivizes other states to adopt tough gun laws similar to those in Massachusetts and implement our proven methods, which have been successful in reducing deaths from gun violence.

https://t.co/sg0stHs7CpIn Massachusetts, would-be gun buyers "must complete a four-hour gun safety course, get character references from two people", and have a one-on-one interview with a police officer.

These laws save lives and should serve as a model for the nation. 

https://t.co/4ZRyCV0NSFIn October, @SenWarren &amp; I asked DHS to verify the official death count in Puerto Rico from Maria fearing the actual count could be 10x higher. 

It’s 70x higher. This is either the result of shocking incompetence or a deliberate underestimation. Someone must be held accountable.Here’s what’s not confusing. Robert Mueller’s investigation has thus far resulted in 19 people being indicted or pleading guilty. Mueller is a top-tier investigator. If there’s crime, he’s going to find it. It’s not surprising that Trump is trying to undermine our justice system.Trump accuses those investigating Russian meddling in U.S. elections of meddling in U.S. elections &amp; still hasn’t said the same about the Russians... who meddled in U.S. elections. It’s confusing &amp; that’s the point. He wants to undermine faith in the effort to get to the truth. https://t.co/ALEJYCwmdMThe Trump @FCC’s #NetNeutrality repeal takes effect in less than two weeks. Has your representative signed the petition to fight back and protect the free internet? Check here: https://t.co/zKI7sxSwGjEach flag on Boston Common
today honors one of the 37,268 Massachusetts residents who died defending our nation since the Revolutionary War. Thank you to @MaMilHeroes and all of the Bay Staters who came together to make this stirring and solemn display possible. #MemorialDay https://t.co/B0dLZj1w2aToday, and every day, we honor the memories of those who have fallen and reaffirm our commitment to those who return home. As Americans, we must remember our duty to pay homage to their sacrifice not only with our words, but through our actions. #MemorialDay https://t.co/kGsA61a0cVIt’s time for you to pay your tab and get out, Scott. You don’t have to go to your lobbyist’s condo, but you can’t stay here.  #BootPruitt
https://t.co/QXjbD35RA3The EPA is supposed to work for the American people, but under Scott Pruitt it seems to work for shady special interests like the American Chemistry Council that seek to suppress science like this important formaldehyde study.
https://t.co/tmtOXFkQSAIt’s official! The Senate designated May as National Brain Tumor Awareness Month. Happy to join Sen. @SteveDaines, @SenatorCollins &amp; Sen. @ChrisVanHollen to raise awareness about brain tumors &amp; to support groups like @NBTStweets in their advocacy &amp; outreach activities. #BTAMStarting today, under the EU's new privacy law, Europeans’ data will belong to them, not corporations. I’ve introduced a resolution urging companies to give Americans the same safeguards. Americans deserve better than second-class privacy protections.
https://t.co/8ziq1O3kxs https://t.co/LAC6s7v0xgDrug manufacturers must be held accountable for their role in the #OpioidCrisis.

I’m asking @SecAzar and others to investigate if the industry’s profit motives are improperly influencing the education that prescribers receive &amp; endangering American lives.
https://t.co/bZ12aV4RgtTune in soon! I’ll be talking today’s #NorthKorea news. https://t.co/qzxIwdiE30I’ll be on @CNN with @WolfBlitzer at 6 ET. Tune in for a discussion about @realDonaldTrump canceling the #NorthKorea summit and where we go from here.Sec. Pompeo refused to acknowledge that the “Libya model” @VP and Bolton suggested for #NorthKorea confirmed Kim Jong Un’s suspicions and contributed to cancellation of the summit. We should be negotiating peace. Unfortunately, it seems that our chief diplomat is negotiating war.Offshore wind has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs in Massachusetts and up and down the East Coast, harness homegrown innovation, and reduce carbon pollution. https://t.co/4RjpkJHSJoYou can't begin a negotiation with NK by advocating for the worst conclusion for its leader &amp; expect that negotiation to succeed. President Trump did little to disavow this declaration from his advisors &amp; has approached this summit from the outset with naivete and inconsistency.When @VP Pence and John Bolton declared that Libya was a model for persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, they confirmed Kim Jong Un’s deep-seated fears that the upcoming negotiations would be nothing more than a tactic to invade &amp; disarm his country.I urge President Trump not to continue with the kind of threatening rhetoric that he used today in his letter, as it only serves to enflame and destabilize the region. While the challenges to a lasting agreement with North Korea are great, we should not abandon diplomacy.When people are sick, they get a treatment plan. America needs a nationwide treatment plan for fighting the #OpioidCrisis. The Opioid Milestones Act will provide national benchmarks for ensuring that our federal &amp; state resources pay lifesaving dividends.
https://t.co/iYw38VUsur https://t.co/xQdslOoMuHThe fight to save the internet is in full swing in the House. The Big Broadband special interests are counting on us to slow down and let up – don’t. 

You can check to see if your Rep. has signed the petition to force a vote to save #NetNeutrality here: https://t.co/zKI7sxSwGjMassachusetts just awarded the first contract to build an offshore wind farm off of our coast. This is such an important milestone. Rather than drilling for oil and gas off of the New England coast, we will find our energy future blowing in the wind.
https://t.co/kuBmiBW8w7Congratulations to Longmeadow’s own Brynn Cartelli for winning @NBCTheVoice, the youngest winner ever! All of Massachusetts was cheering you on and I’m sure you’ll continue to make us proud as you go on to do amazing things.America is exporting 2.5 million barrels of oil per day. Why send our oil overseas instead of keeping it here to benefit American families?

Because #BigOil stands to see $500 billion in new revenue over the next 20 years as a result of U.S. oil exports. 

https://t.co/Ml9COtfBXkAmerica is exporting 2.5 million barrels of oil a day to China and elsewhere while we import that exact same amount from OPEC and the Middle East. That only makes sense to the #BigOil executives getting rich while American families are getting turned upside down at the pump.OPEC, Russia, &amp; others have been conspiring to boost oil prices to hurt Americans. I’m introducing legislation that requires President Trump to negotiate with these nations to put an end to this cartel manipulating markets &amp; take action against any country that refuses to stop.LIVE: Gas prices have risen 25% since @realDonaldTrump took office. I’m with @SenSchumer, @SenatorCantwell and @SenatorMenendez calling on President Trump to take action and fight for American consumers, not #BigOil, OPEC, China and Russia.

WATCH HERE: https://t.co/gMLjDpDt0iMassachusetts is #1 in education in part because we pay our teachers fair wages. But for years, teachers across America have been asked to do more with less. This funding would improve salaries, upgrade classrooms, renovate schools and lift achievement.
https://t.co/jAJzgQeinKIn the Trump administration, it’s open season on any rule, regulation, or law that enforces even the most basic humanity or common sense in the way we treat our environment and wildlife.  
 
The only bears @realDonaldTrump seems to want to protect are in Russia. https://t.co/yFi8Guw9PtScott Pruitt can’t stay out of the headlines even when he’s specifically trying to stay out of some headlines. 
 
This is an affront to the First Amendment. Pruitt isn’t just outrageous, he’s downright dangerous, and he must be fired. 

https://t.co/UcXpvdPh4W-incoherent foreign policy that roils oil markets
-exporting American crude to China and elsewhere
-dismantling fuel economy emissions standards
-draining more than 1/3rd of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve

Trump and the @GOP’s policies are driving up gas prices for Americans. https://t.co/6Z1IFElbT9.@realDonaldTrump says his agenda is ‘America First’, but the policies he and Republicans are pursuing put #BigOil first and American consumers last. https://t.co/kyKDJGTVX7More and more American crude oil - now 2.5M barrels/day - is being shipped overseas, benefitting #BigOil and China at the expense of American consumers. That must stop. I’m introducing legislation that will put an immediate end to all new oil exports.

https://t.co/oRsEYcetzK https://t.co/vxdUvPTc33The Supreme Court just dealt yet another crushing blow to labor. Conservatives love private arbitration because it allows employers to deny legal rights to workers. 5-4 SCOTUS decisions like this are the clearest example of elections having consequences.
https://t.co/XFkkPrHSnZSince @realDonaldTrump took office, gas prices have risen 25% — that means the average U.S. consumer is now paying roughly $350 more/year to fill up. 

I have a plan to address rising gas prices: https://t.co/PQskqbAG5eChina has claimed that its South China Sea construction was for purposes like “meteorological observation, environmental protection, and fishery production service.” Which one of those includes nuclear-capable, long-range bomber flights?” 
https://t.co/SwGUN1lTioA nuke is a nuke, period. “Low-yield” weapons incinerated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Instead of leading efforts to reintroduce nukes into warfighting, America should continue to lead global efforts to reduce and eventually entirely eliminate nuclear weapons.
https://t.co/vvssOQnmApIt’s time Congress put limits on the President’s unilateral authority to launch a nuclear first strike. We should pass HR 669/S 200 by @RepTedLieu &amp; me which requires @POTUS to get congressional approval before launching a nuclear first strike. #MadamSecretary https://t.co/KDnYaFyhHbAs long as @realDonaldTrump has a Twitter account, the U.S. needs a nuclear no first use policy. #MadamSecretary https://t.co/BR4EfMqh6DFor any reason or for no reason at all, @realDonaldTrump could launch a nuclear first strike and no one could stop him. That’s wrong. That’s why @RepTedLieu and I authored a bill to require congressional authorization before we start a nuclear war. #MadamSecretary https://t.co/8EPgS8ipj3As soon as we see the name of a high school trending, we know it’s a school shooting. This isn’t normal and none of us should accept it as normal. #SantaFeHighSchoolYesterday, we found out @realDonaldTrump doesn’t know the difference between HPV and HIV.
 
Today, he will impose a new gag rule that threatens access to vital reproductive health care services through #TitleX.
 
This is an all-out war on women’s basic rights. We must fight back.Congress failed the victims at Sante Fe High School. I am disgusted and angry that we continue to fail our kids. I grieve with the families and friends who have lost loved ones.

But thoughts and prayers must be accompanied by real solutions. Otherwise, it’s an empty platitude.Gina Haspel ran one of the CIA’s first overseas “rendition, detention, and interrogation” programs in Thailand. The atrocities committed on her watch were barbaric, immoral, ineffective, and disqualifying. I will vote NO on her nomination for CIA director.On this, the one-year anniversary of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, let us not forget that the wheels of justice turn slowly, but grind exceedingly fine.

Let’s continue the conversation.This is the European Council President saying America’s helping hand is so small under Trump that America’s friendship is an illusion. “America First” is more than a campaign slogan, it’s a naive ideology that has consequences like the erosion of our most important relationships. https://t.co/QJIZQKOeJAThe people saying we can’t win on #NetNeutrality in the House are the same people who, just 5 months ago, were saying we could never do it in the Senate. 

Ignore them. Just keep fighting.Celebrate today’s historic #NetNeutrality victory in the Senate. But the fight in the House starts TOMORROW.

For our economy, our democracy, and for everyday Americans, there is only one choice: save #NetNeutrality.If we don’t save #NetNeutrality @AjitPaiFCC will turn the internet into a digital oligarchy.

https://t.co/qyZEXPFlWDSimply put, my CRA resolution will put #NetNeutrality back on the books because in 2018, access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a RIGHT.

#OneMoreVoteThird, the CRA will prevent ISPs from setting up internet fast and slow lanes. ISPs won’t be able to charge large websites for access to an internet fast lane while websites that can’t afford the internet EZ pass will load at a bumper to bumper pace.Second, the CRA will ensure ISPs cannot throttle, or slow down, a website of their choosing, especially a competitor.First, the CRA will protect websites from being entirely blocked by ISPs (internet service providers). That means an ISP cannot block a video chat service, just so you’ll use their own service. And it will prevent ISPs from blocking a website with a contrary political viewpoint.Next week’s vote on my resolution to *fully* restore #NetNeutrality will be the most important vote for the internet in the history of the United States Senate.

#OneMoreVoteThe American people are paying close attention to who is fighting for them and who is sitting on the sidelines.


This vote on #NetNeutrality is coming, and when it does, it will be crystal clear who is protecting corporate buddies and who is fighting for everyday Americans.Don’t be fooled by the voices that say this is all doom and gloom &amp; that the ISPs would NEVER block or throttle content. Mark my words, without #NetNeutrality, these are not alarmist &amp; hypothetical harms. They are real, &amp; without #NetNeutrality they may become the new normal.The fight to save #NetNeutrality is a fight for the most powerful platform in the history of the planet, the internet. And in 2018, access to a free and open internet is a right, not a privilege. 

#OneMoreVoteLIVE: We are entering the homestretch in the historic battle to save #NetNeutrality here in the Senate. Next week, we vote.

If there was ever a time to make your voice heard, it's NOW. https://t.co/C2uMv6k3MNThe reason why the @realDonaldTrump administration repealed #NetNeutrality is simple: it sides with the rich and the powerful first, and consistently, without fail, puts everyday Americans last.

But today, the internet is fighting back.

#OneMoreVote #SaveTheInternet#NetNeutrality ensures that those with the brightest ideas, not merely the deepest pockets, can thrive in the 21st century economy.

My full statement:

https://t.co/eWjV83xYQmLeaving the #IranDeal frees Iran to immediately re-start nuclear activities, encourages its rivals to pursue their own nuclear weapons programs, risks a calamitous military conflict in the Middle East, and bolsters Iran's hardliners.
