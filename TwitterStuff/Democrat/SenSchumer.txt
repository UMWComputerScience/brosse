What a month! Thank you to all the organizers, activists, marchers &amp; friends who made the #Pride events this month a huge success. We're in this together &amp; we will not give up the fight! #PrideMonth #NYCPride https://t.co/AISGjsSpeLThe president has the power to appoint a czar to marshal &amp; organize the agencies in charge of reunifying families. He should exercise that power, listen to all those marching today &amp; clean up the mess he made w/ his slapdash family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarchMr. President - we know each judge on the list of 25 handpicked by the @FedSoc will overturn Roe v. Wade and strike down pre-existing condition protections. You don’t need to ask. https://t.co/rR8t8ErE79A vibrant, free press is a pillar of American democracy enshrined in our Constitution. I salute those who dedicate their lives to this profession and mourn for those we lost yesterday. 2/2I stand w/ fellow Americans who are appalled by the horrific attack at the Capital Gazette, a wonderful community-based newspaper company. 1/2Bob Mueller is a decorated Marine, former DoJ prosecutor, and former FBI Director.  And, let me remind you, he is a REPUBLICAN.  And he was appointed by a REPUBLICAN.  In a little more than a year, he has secured 23 indictments, five guilty pleas and one prison sentence. https://t.co/3sqXhJbBX6If anything should happen at this mtg, @realDonaldTrump must inform Putin of his intent to aggressively implement tough sanctions that Congress passed last yr nearly unanimously and tell him we will no longer stand by while he works to destabilize &amp; harm us &amp; our NATO allies.The American people have to wonder: why is our president so committed to building a relationship with someone so dedicated to undermining our democracy and doing harm to our friends and allies?For @realDonaldTrump to reward President Putin with a one-on-one meeting while Russia actively continues to interfere with our elections &amp; undermine the integrity of the transatlantic alliance, proves his priorities are out of whack.Americans from all corners of the country: rise up &amp; speak out. Tell your Senators that if they vote for a Supreme Court justice who will dismantle your health care protections or overturn Roe v. Wade, they're not fighting for you. Tell them #WhatsAtStake. https://t.co/61JYFk2Dw8 https://t.co/opdDN9ay2kEvery American should have their eyes wide open to the fact that @realDonaldTrump has sworn to nominate a justice, from a pre-ordained list vetted by @Heritage &amp; @FedSoc – organizations whose mission has been to repeal Roe v. Wade and strike at the heart of our health care law..@realDonaldTrump will nominate a justice willing to re-interpret the ruling on the ACA. Remember when he said: “Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us Obamacare.” “I don’t think I’ll have any catastrophic appointment like Justice Roberts.”.@realDonaldTrump will nominate a #SCOTUS justice willing to send Roe “back to the states” – those are his own words – where several are preparing, if not already prepared, to roll back a woman’s right to choose. #WhatsAtStakeSo today @SenateDems &amp; @HouseDemocrats are standing up for public employees – teachers, nurses &amp; health care providers, firefighters, police officers, EMTs, librarians, correctional officers – w/ our #ABetterDeal bill to protect the right to organize &amp; bargain collectively.#Unions built the middle class in this country, &amp; now Republicans &amp; their friends on the court are doing everything they can to rip them apart at the seams. The Janus decision was a gut punch to working people across the country.If the Senate’s constitutional duty to advise and consent is just as important as the President’s right to nominate, as Leader McConnell also reminded us, why should a midterm election be any less important than a presidential election?If GOP were consistent, they would wait to consider Justice Kennedy’s successor until after the midterm elections. Time &amp; again Ldr McConnell claimed the American ppl should have a voice in deciding the next SCOTUS Justice. That was in Feb of an election year. It’s almost July.Why do you trust Putin more than your own Republican DOJ officials and the Republican special counsel that was appointed by a Republican?  Sit down and do the interview. https://t.co/4Cvgf3zX9nIn 2016, Senate Republicans said that the American people deserve an opportunity to speak on Supreme Court nominees. 

Now that Justice Kennedy is retiring and @realDonaldTrump is president, will they silence them? https://t.co/nT0wtgET6OAmericans should make it clear that they will not tolerate a nominee chosen from President Trump’s pre-ordained list, selected by powerful special interests, who will reverse the progress we have made over the decades.People from all across America should realize that their rights and opportunities are threatened and should make their voices heard loudly, clearly, and consistently.Millions of ppl are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject POTUS’s nominee, &amp; their voices deserve to be heard now, as @SenateMajLdr thought they deserved to be heard then. Anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy.My @SenateGOP colleagues should follow the rule they set in 2016 not to consider a SCOTUS nominee in an election year. Sen McConnell would tell anyone who listened that the Senate had the right to advise &amp; consent, &amp; that was every bit as important as POTUS’ right to nominate.The Senate should reject anyone who will instinctively side with powerful special interests over the interests of average Americans.Will Republicans &amp; @realDonaldTrump nominate &amp; vote for someone who will preserve protections for people w/ preexisting conditions, or will they support a justice who will put health insurance companies over patients, or put the federal government between a woman &amp; her doctor?This is the most important Supreme Court vacancy for this country in at least a generation. Nothing less than the fate of our health care system, reproductive rights for women, and countless other protections for middle-class Americans are at stake..@realDonaldTrump needs to end the inhumanity &amp; chaos at the border, but we also need a real strategy to go after cartels &amp; gangs in Central America, curbing the violence that sends migrants north in the first place. @SenateDems unveil our plan at 12pm: https://t.co/OwQ52Dgy3VThere is a pretty simple reason people are fleeing Central America. It is the impunity of gangs and cartels and the brutal violence they spread.I want to be clear: anyone who supports the lawsuit against the ACA has said loud and clear that they don’t support protections for people with pre-existing conditions. More LIVE: https://t.co/zm7geApNObThe Republican strategy is clear: increase the deficit on behalf of special interests, then use that as an excuse to slash benefits that hardworking Americans have earned.  Democrats will do everything possible to prevent that from happening.Today’s report is another reminder about the true costs of handing out massive tax breaks to billionaires &amp; large corporations: https://t.co/VnBeyDtIp4The president’s travel ban doesn’t make us safer, and the Supreme Court’s ruling doesn’t make it right. This is a backward and un-American policy that fails to improve our national security.Simply put, @realDonaldTrump turned his back on the most popular &amp; most humane advancement in our health care system: protections for Americans w/ pre-existing conditions. The young people with us today &amp; everyone they fight for deserve better.We’re here w/ @LittleLobbyists today because the protections put in place by the ACA for people with pre-existing conditions are under assault.  Watch live: https://t.co/4uZn5xZGvR https://t.co/z9HMqaNGuV.@realDonaldTrump, you said giving corporations like Harley a big tax giveaway would mean more jobs. 

Instead, many corporate executives announced buybacks and laid off American workers.
https://t.co/JU9SOv9rdU https://t.co/fEbqWKT8g5Chief Spadafora spent his whole life serving the ppl of NY, &amp;we can never thank him enough. He answered the call time &amp; time again when tragedy struck. He led recovery efforts after 9/11 &amp; that has now taken his life.  He will forever be one of our heroes. https://t.co/j77sdMDfznThen why are you tweeting about it? These decisions can &amp; should be made by @realDonaldTrump's appointees at @FBI &amp; @TheJusticeDept. 
And, another reminder, Special Counsel Mueller has either indicted or secured guilty pleas from 20 ppl &amp; 3 Cos. (including 3 former Trump aides) https://t.co/GvQJjcNwZHFamily dinner tonight at L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens in the heart of Italian Brooklyn — like eating in Sicily! https://t.co/n9d7oKpDdWMarching in the #NYCPride Parade has special meaning this year as I am marching with my daughter Alison and her wonderful fiancée Biz! #HappyPride https://t.co/xYj8ENi80NSee you there! https://t.co/lLdoTIp81XThe Trump ‘zero-tolerance’ immigration policy has left many with zero confidence in the admin’s ability to quickly reunite children w/ their parents. The admin should appoint a Czar to break thru the bureaucracy &amp; get these kids out of limbo &amp; back in their parents arms.The Special Counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in US elections has either indicted or secured guilty pleas from 20 ppl &amp; 3 companies. Five of these ppl, including three former Trump aides, have already pleaded guilty. https://t.co/GkhtbddLgTPeople of all political stripes should read conservative @GeorgeWill’s amazing column: https://t.co/xr5X756cC8Best wishes and congrats go out to @TinaMoorereport on being promoted by the @nypost as the paper’s FIRST female Police Bureau Chief.It may be the GOP’s 6 mo anniversary, but remember what @realDonaldTrump promised the American people? He said the Republican tax bill would give a $4,000 raise for the average American family. Spoiler: it hasn’t. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/X0YANf5wG0If you look at the numbers, corporations are reaping record profits as a result of the #GOPTaxScam, but that savings isn’t really being passed onto their workers. https://t.co/NEjSnC2xReSince the beginning of 2018, corporations have announced plans to repurchase more than $480 billion in stock buybacks. Meanwhile, the @washingtonpost reported that “wages aren’t just flat, they are falling” for the largest group of American workers. https://t.co/II7oKuMalt6 mos ago, in the dead of night, the GOP jammed thru the #GOPTaxScam lavishing tax cuts on big corps &amp; the wealthiest few. @realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP promised this would help the middle class, &amp; even give families $4K more in their pockets. But the tax law has failed to deliver.More increases in health insurance rates out of Indiana and Iowa today—those higher costs are thanks to the sabotage actions of the Trump administration &amp; Republicans in Congress, who are more concerned about scoring political points than lowering costs for American families.Open borders, @realDonaldTrump? The bipartisan immigration bill I authored had $40 billion for border security and would have been far more effective than the wall.While @realDonaldTrump signed an exec order on his policy of family separation, it does nothing for the &gt;2,300 children who have already been separated. Today @NancyPelosi &amp; I are writing him with one simple request: reunite these suffering children with their families. https://t.co/MQ3YcIXavw.@realDonaldTrump hasn’t taken care of the problem, not by any stretch of the imagination. But now that he’s finally admitted that his administration does have the power to take action, I urge him to address these serious, unresolved issues.What is the admin's plan to reunite the children already separated from their families? The EO is silent on that. How many facilities are these kids in now? What is their condition? Why hasn’t the media been allowed in to see and verify that the conditions are humane?The way the executive order was drafted means that it will not go into effect until a court rules on its legality. What is @realDonaldTrump's policy on family separation in the meantime? Will he continue to insist that these heartbreaking separations continue?I hope this means @realDonaldTrump will stop blaming others for problems he creates &amp; start fixing them himself. He may have signed his executive order, but we have even more questions:For a little over a month, @realDonaldTrump’s family separation policy has resulted in &gt;2,300 children separated from their families. After wks of acting like his admin bore no responsibility for the policy, contravening all fact &amp; reality, I hope this represents a turning point.Keeping these children separated from their families is unacceptable and must be rectified. This has to be our number one priority #KeepFamiliesTogether
https://t.co/H2bkvKtDpcHe can start with correcting the problems that this executive order will create, and should also undo his #DACA order, which has put so many young people in limbo.I also hope this represents a turning point &amp; @POTUS will stop blaming others for problems he creates &amp; start fixing them himself.It’s a relief that @realDonaldTrump has reversed himself &amp; recognized the cruelty of his policy of separating families. While the EO doesn’t reference the families already ripped apart, I hope &amp; expect that the admin will be able to quickly reunite these children w/their parents.Protecting US jobs &amp; our nation’s security must remain paramount &amp; not something that we can compromise on. As my colleagues on both sides have already stated, it is vital that the House keep this bipartisan provision in the defense bill as it heads towards a conference.My Republican colleagues must resist efforts by the Trump administration – at the behest of the Government of China -  to get them to water down or back off of the Senate’s strong language on ZTE in the defense bill.It’s as easy as this Mr. President. Just sign on the line, @realDonaldTrump. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/rhZcd9Iib2It's unconscionable that the US govt is housing babies &amp; toddlers alone in an institutional setting. This crisis was willfully &amp; purposefully created by @realDonaldTrump. It can &amp; should be ended by the same mechanism. 

With the simple flick of a pen, this can be ended.You - and not the law - are responsible for this family separation policy, @realDonaldTrump. GOP Senators and members of your own administration have confirmed this. You could reverse this terrible practice in a few minutes- but you refuse to lift a finger. https://t.co/goVSkJoGVkAnyone who believes this Republican Congress is capable of addressing this issue is kidding themselves. @realDonaldTrump can end this crisis with the flick of his pen, and he needs to do so now..@SpeakerRyan wants to pass a massive bill that may not even pass the House &amp; couldn’t pass Senate, @SenateGOP are supposedly eyeing a bill @realDonaldTrump wouldn’t sign even if it made it to his desk&amp; @POTUS continues to try to use separated fams as hostages in the leg process..@realDonaldTrump, if you share the outrage of the vast majority of Americans, if you’re ashamed of what’s happening at the border, YOU CAN change your administration’s policy right now. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/hhVn9lGd0XThe Trump administration and Republicans in Congress should work with Democrats in a bipartisan way to make health care more affordable instead of taking actions that jack up costs on middle-class families and those that are sick that need health care the most.That’s exactly why more than 95% of the health care groups that filed comments about this proposed rule criticized it. In fact, not a single group that represents physicians, nurses, hospitals, or patients voiced support for it.Finalizing this rule is simply the latest act of sabotage of our health care system by the Trump administration and a back door to expanding junk insurance plans that weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/WL2rw1cjCVIt is vital that our colleagues in the House keep this bipartisan provision in the bill as it heads towards a conference.We’re heartened that both parties made it clear that protecting American jobs and national security must come first when making deals with countries like China, which has a history of having little regard for either.Joining @SenTomCotton @ChrisVanHollen &amp; @marcorubio in releasing a joint statement following the passage of #NDAA with a bipartisan ZTE amendment: https://t.co/S7A1EzQ55WAs everyone who has looked at this agrees, this was done by the president, not Democrats. He can fix it tomorrow if he wants to, and if he doesn’t want to, he should own up to the fact that he’s doing it. https://t.co/PC5UUIUyFjIf the House moderates really want to get something done on immigration, they should not be duped by their leadership for a bill that they know isn’t going anywhere.House mods will lose all credibility if they accept this sham of a bill; it's extreme &amp; drastically cuts immigration in ways unacceptable to the Senate &amp; American ppl. It holds #Dreamers &amp;kids separated frm parents hostage to cut legal immigration &amp; enact the hard right’s agenda.Instead of supporting this so-called “moderate” bill, @HouseGOP who want to get something done for Dreamers should stick to their original idea: Protect the Dreamers and work in a bipartisan way to secure the border.By all reports, the House “moderate” immigration bill is hardly moderate at all. It would cut legal immigration dramatically and punish #Dreamers.
It’s hard to believe that so-called House Republican moderates could vote for such a party line bill that is doomed to fail.He turned 95 this week folks! Very grateful for my dad, Abe and my mom, Selma- she turned 90 on #DDay- and all they’ve done for our family. A happy #FathersDay to all! https://t.co/pi3QmYk9zoToday as we celebrate #FathersDay, I want to share a few words I said about my Dad, Abe Schumer, this week on his 95th birthday. He is a #WWII veteran, and he worked so hard to let his children and grandchildren follow their dreams. I'll never stop being grateful for that. https://t.co/ciOdlrKrHD.@realDonaldTrump, the IG report found what we all knew: James Comey’s actions helped you. During the election, the Russia investigation was concealed from the public, the other was inappropriately turned into a media circus. https://t.co/00nKcTCT1zMinnesota implemented a reinsurance program. This is what can happen when states support patients and fight back against @realDonaldTrump and @SenateGOP efforts to undermine our health care system. https://t.co/NQmErwvuLoRepublicans in the House put forth a proposal that is dead on arrival in the Senate. When they get serious about finding an actual solution, Democrats will be ready to join them at the table.Today marks the 6th anniversary of the announcement #DACA. Rather than celebrating all of the things immigrant youth gained, we are instead reminded that our Republican colleagues and the Trump administration are not serious about finding a solution for our #Dreamers.Unless of course by “my people” the President means his cabinet: https://t.co/fTkYkVM4aEThis is the United States is America, not the United States of Trump. We are a democracy not a dictatorship. So thank God this will never happen. https://t.co/JfloxF1yvB.@realDonaldTrump’s actions on China are on the money. China is our real trade enemy, &amp; their theft of intellectual property &amp; their refusal to let our companies compete fairly threatens millions of future US jobs. https://t.co/28UM7p9v2c.@realDonaldTrump which makes more sense? You fired Comey because he HURT Hillary Clinton? Or this: https://t.co/5IMSWIsUznI hope Sec @stevenmnuchin1 @SecAzar &amp; @SecretaryAcosta will abandon their proposed rule, and instead work with @SenateDems to improve health care and lower costs for American families. https://t.co/kg5VkWNF1sWe've been hearing from our constituents about these #junkplans, and a recent @latimes analysis found “[n]ot a single group representing patients, physicians, nurses or hospitals voiced support in the public comments for the two Trump administration proposals.” https://t.co/t7lsFHQEWOHealthcare experts overwhelmingly condemn the Trump administration’s plan, asserting the expanded sale and marketing of short-term “#junkplans” will negatively affect coverage. https://t.co/ZlYK5zjp2UToday 44 Senators signed this letter to members of @realDonaldTrump's cabinet urging them to listen to the patients, advocates, doctors, nurses, hospitals &amp; other medical providers who have spoken out against #junkplans &amp; stop moving forward with their proposed rule. https://t.co/7nzQ3Ou2iyDirector Comey’s mishandling of the publicity around the Clinton email campaign all accrued to the benefit of then candidate Trump, not the other way around. Democrats said it then, and the Inspector General makes that clear now.I’ve now seen the Inspector General’s report. It contains no evidence to make any reasonable person conclude that the Mueller investigation is anything other than independent, impartial &amp; just as important today as it was before this report was issued.My dad, a #WorldWarII veteran turns 95 today on #FlagDay. What a blessing! https://t.co/ZzcMRzBh8IAfter promising to protect ppl w/ pre-existing conditions from being denied affordable health care, @realDonaldTrump stabbed them right in the back by trying to remove those protections in the courts &amp; by trying to expand #junkplans that will effectively price them out.The latest report from the American Academy of Actuaries further confirms that the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans’ systematic efforts to sabotage our health care system are driving up costs for millions of middle-class families.
https://t.co/k63FaRtfP3Both Rs &amp; Ds must be resolute in blocking @realDonaldTrump's bad pro-China ZTE deal. Protecting our natl &amp; economic security is paramount, &amp;any deal that jeopardizes them should be stopped as both parties have already agreed. We can't back off on an issue so vital to America.Exactly right. The Finger Lakes region is not and will never be a good location for this incinerator, and we have to stand strong to protect local jobs, so many in the tourism industry, &amp; our precious natural resources. #FLX https://t.co/ss7Mmao3ACThe income inequality gap is at the highest levels since the Great Depression, a sure sign the Trump admin and the GOP in Congress need to work with Democrats to give workers #ABetterDeal &amp; a chance to achieve basic economic security.
https://t.co/M7y40V9eoqIf @realDonaldTrump truly wants to make America great again, he needs to start by protecting American workers &amp; disassembling the rigged system that undermines their freedoms. He can start by joining us in giving workers #ABetterDeal. More: https://t.co/QHAXeQvcg7Hard to believe it’s been 10 years without one of America’s greatest journalists and Buffalo’s most passionate advocates. From Western NY to Washington, we miss you Tim. #GoBills https://t.co/kyedDWTux0The emphasis on showmanship as opposed to substance at the #NorthKoreaSummit will not serve America or the prospects for peace well in the long run.Mr. President, if only it were that easy, that simple. https://t.co/zDMhHTkxCaGlad you noticed. We wrote you last month asking for action: https://t.co/z113B9yrrS https://t.co/Oa0JdIQAsrRepublicans should instead work with Democrats now and throughout the summer to focus on lowering healthcare costs for the American people.Actions speak louder than words. So far, the @SenateGOP’s own legislation and the Trump administration’s actions prove that they’re hell-bent on sabotaging the system, driving up costs for American families, and undermining protections for pre-existing conditions.If Republicans are serious about maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions, they should join us in urging the Trump administration to reverse their shameful decision to not defend the constitutionality of that vital provision that is already the law.ICYMI @SenatorHassan on how the Trump administration has put politics over people by refusing to defend protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. Watch: https://t.co/PqPL3gZaVNWhat the United States has gained is vague and unverifiable; what North Korea has gained, however, is tangible and lasting. More on our take on the #NorthKoreaSummit LIVE: https://t.co/lJuj9bMrTdGo @NYRangers! But congrats to the @Capitals and stay safe everyone celebrating in DC today. https://t.co/07Gz2s5l3A2 yrs ago today, 49 beautiful lives were taken from us far too soon. Today we remember &amp; mourn but we must, must, must #HonorThemWithAction in every community, city &amp; state. Have the hard conversation today about #GunViolence in America. Dont put it off. Tell the story of #Pulse. https://t.co/Q439wkK2mLThe fact that a bipartisan group of senators came together this quickly is a testament to how bad the Trump administration's ZTE deal is and how we will not shy away from holding the president's feet to the fire when it comes to keeping his promise to be tough on China.By including this provision to undo the ZTE deal in the defense bill, the Senate is saying loudly and in a bipartisan fashion that @realDonaldTrump is dead wrong to back off on ZTE..@SenateMajLdr has shown he’s willing to confirm a judge over the objection of one home state Senator, but he will erase a fine &amp; noble tradition of bipartisanship &amp; consultation if he schedules a vote &amp; confirms a judge opposed by both Senators, like Bounds.Bounds is also controversial &amp; had some rather offensive writings that he failed to disclose to the bipartisan Judicial Advisory Committee established by @RonWyden &amp; @SenJeffMerkley, yet despite the opposition of BOTH OR senators, the Majority is moving forward with Bounds’ nom.Farr has spent a lengthy legal career defending the interests of corps against their workers. He 2x defended the GOP's gerrymandering of congressional districts &amp; defended NC’s restrictive voter ID law, which “targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.”In the next few weeks, the Senate is likely to take up two highly controversial judicial nominees: Thomas Farr for the Eastern District of North Carolina and Ryan Bounds for a Ninth Circuit seat in Oregon.In today’s decision, the #SCOTUS seemingly ignores the rights of the eligible voters who will be denied the right to vote in future elections simply because they chose not to vote in the past.When Congress passed the NVRA, a balance between was struck between the desire to make it as easy as possible for eligible voters to cast ballots and the need for States to maintain accurate voter rolls.Democracy suffers when laws make it harder for U.S. Citizens to vote. This decision is dangerous and damaging and is NOT why we passed the National Voter Registration Act in ‘93. In fact, this goes completely against the spirit of the law.The right to  vote is the most sacred right we have as citizens. Aggressive voter purge systems like Ohio’s essentially make voting a “use it or lose it” privilege.The ongoing push to disenfranchise American voters, led by the Trump administration and its allies at the state and local level, received a big boost from the #SCOTUS today. This is why elections matter. https://t.co/XzchYbpB9JOne of many reasons small business owners, and all Americans, should make sure their representatives are fighting to #SaveTheInternet. #NetNeutrality https://t.co/O2nuWjaWf9Every Republican who opposed this vote will own any and all of the damaging consequences of the FCC’s horribly misguided decision.It's now as clear as day to every American that w/the exception of 3 @SenateGOP mbrs, their GOP reps in the Congress chose to protect special interests &amp; the biggest corps over middle-class families, avg consumers, entrepreneurs &amp; anyone who relies on the free &amp; open internet.That’s exactly why the entire Senate Democratic caucus sent a letter last week urging @SpeakerRyan to schedule a vote immediately to #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/3nDVGUg0mxBy refusing to bring up the Senate-passed, bipartisan resolution to restore #NetNeutrality House GOP leaders gave a green light to the big ISPs to charge middle-class Americans, small business owners, schools, rural Americans, and communities of color more to use the internet.Over the past couple of weeks, we have lost some very well-known people, near and dear to so many in New York, but in the past year, we have lost tens-of-thousands of lives to suicide in this country. 45,000 to be exact. One is too many. 45,000 demands action. Read more: https://t.co/14q2710DT5Statistics show that if we can reach troubled people before, even in the midst of suicide ideation, there is a good chance they can be helped. 

We must do better. https://t.co/YZCnorkLhvAre we executing Putin’s diplomatic and national security strategy or AMERICA’s diplomatic and national security strategy? After the last few days, it’s hard to tell..@realDonaldTrump, let me take a second to update my numbers.  Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation has now either indicted or secured guilty pleas from 20 people and three companies. Five of these people, including three former Trump aides, have already pleaded guilty. https://t.co/5zZuq8288wYet again the Trump Admin is sabotaging your health care. We’re urging @realDonaldTrump &amp; @TheJusticeDept to reverse course immediately &amp; stand up for the protections the American people rely on. Our letter: https://t.co/USa4XlS4D1Readmitting Russia to the G-7 would reward Vladimir Putin for actions the U.S. and its allies have condemned, and would clearly be contrary to America’s interests. The president’s foreign policy decision making seems to become more erratic every day. https://t.co/y44JhesqCSThe president’s support for inviting Russia back into the G-7, just after they meddled in the election to support his campaign, will leave millions of Americans with serious questions and suspicions.We need the president to be able to distinguish between our allies and adversaries, and to treat each accordingly. On issue after issue, he’s failed to do that..@realDonaldTrump is turning our foreign policy into an international joke, doing lasting damage to our country, without any rhyme or reason.A little less tweeting, a little more preparing for the summit. Our points are important ones that should be considered. https://t.co/HjByfXesAjThe Trump administration once again is allowing premiums to go up and middle class Americans to pay more. The ACA is the law of the land and DOJ should defend it.With ICBMs and nuclear warheads in the hands of North Korea, the situation is far too dangerous for seat of the pants negotiating. https://t.co/s1EtN48tvvWe passed our #NetNeutrality CRA in the Senate, &amp; @SenateDems are still in the fight. Today we wrote to @SpeakerRyan to let him know the clock is ticking &amp; it's past time he let the House vote to #savetheinternet: https://t.co/8eUSDe4m2g https://t.co/RuXg3370IMToday @SenateDems urged @SpeakerRyan to put middle-class families over special interests &amp; vote on the bipartisan Senate-passed #NetNeutrality bill.

It’s simply the right thing to do. https://t.co/uVJIyzVedt.@realDonaldTrump should be aiming his trade fire at China, but instead he inexplicably aims it at allies like Canada, Mexico and Europe. When it comes to China, despite his tough talk, this deal with ZTE proves the president just shoots blanks. https://t.co/Kaqf3KfKbNIt is clear to me that we need an all-of-the-above approach to safety, so I am urging @USDOT &amp; @ENERGY to finally publish &amp; finalize standards that will stabilize highly explosive crude oil before shipping it through Upstate New York.
https://t.co/cP5oddItRV“If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts. If the law and the facts are against you, pound the table and yell like hell.” -Carl Sandburg https://t.co/KuxihoXADXIt would not have been decided in our favor if not for the American troops, grizzled veterans &amp; fresh faced recruits, who, on that fateful morning 74 years ago, “laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.” Let us never forget them. #DDay74#DDay was a turning point in a war that determined the outcome of human freedom in the 20th Century.Today we give thanks for the brave men who gave their lives that day to break Hitler’s hold on Europe, and their comrades who sustained the long march that liberated a continent and ended the Nazi menace.74 yrs ago, Allied forces conducted the largest seaborne invasion in human history. At stake were not only the lives of hundreds of thousands of American sailors, pilots, infantry &amp;paratroopers, as well as Canadian &amp;English forces, but the future of Europe &amp;the cause of freedom.Little has changed in Brooklyn, maybe the languages spoken, but parents are still working hard &amp; encouraging their children to do even better. We have to remember that this #ImmigrantHeritageMonth. Our country has always welcomed immigrants. It’s who we are.This month we #CelebrateImmigrants and share our own stories. For me, that starts in Brooklyn where my whole block was first-, second-, &amp; third-generation Italian, Irish and Jewish Americans.
