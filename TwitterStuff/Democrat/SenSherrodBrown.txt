The expansion of the Women’s Recovery Center in Cleveland is just a small step toward ensuring Ohioans have the resources they need to combat the opioid crisis. https://t.co/wyScCGM4cwWhat’s worse is that the Federal Reserve wants to make life even easier for the big banks, by removing a key funding constraint and reportedly making next year’s tests even easier. -SBInstead of payouts to executives and wealthy shareholders, big banks should be reinvesting profits into workers, lowering costs for consumers, and taking steps to avoid more taxpayer bailouts.Between the partisan tax bill, the #DoddFrankRollback bill, and the Administration constantly checking items off of Wall Street’s wish list, it’s a great year to be a big bank. https://t.co/wI4XP7Jx3gThis past month, we joined together to recommit ourselves to ensuring all Americans, regardless of who they love, have the equal rights and equal protections they deserve.

We will always #StandWithWorkers.Pope Francis said, “We don't get dignity from power nor money or culture. We get dignity from work.” And part of the dignity of work is about giving workers power in their workplace, and a seat at the table.#JanusvsAFSCME is an attack on workers' freedom to advocate for themselves. Workers produce more than ever, but don’t share in the wealth they create. Our economy doesn’t value work. We change that by giving workers a voice in the businesses they help build – not silencing them.Thanks to the families from each of Ohio’s children’s hospitals for coming in today to tell your stories and discuss everything from the importance of Medicaid to superhero parties.

This would provide a stronger Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit to more families and workers. https://t.co/Vx4bMxVklSThen there's the Corporate Freeloader Fee: if you pay your workers what their work is worth, you get a tax cut. But if you choose to pay people so low that they are forced onto government assistance, you have to reimburse taxpayers. https://t.co/YZtz7FZrk1First, the Patriot Corporation Act: this bill would cut taxes for corporations that commit to staying in the US, to hiring in the US, and to providing good wages and fair benefits for workers. https://t.co/AficTAB49fAt #CAPIdeas this morning, discussed some of our ideas for a tax bill that would have actually put more money back in the pockets of American workers and fixed some of the broken incentives in our economic system.We trust schools to educate and prepare students, but ECOT, William Lager, and his companies have abused that trust to rig the system to enrich themselves.

Connie and I are wishing you all the best, Todd. -SB https://t.co/X8D5sX4TyZWe know addiction treatment and workforce training programs can be successful separately, but this crisis requires them to work together. The CARE Act – cosponsored by @SenCapito – will address the workforce shortage created by the addition crisis → https://t.co/WvpMxV5AQeI hear the same thing from Mayors all across Ohio: employers can’t fill openings because workers can’t pass drug tests, and Ohioans struggling with addiction can’t find a job to help them get back on their feet.The Fair and Equal Housing Act of 2017 would add gender identity and sexual orientation to those protected from discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. https://t.co/gzenuvwHao50 years ago today, the Fair Housing Act made discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing illegal for the first time. And on this anniversary, we must redouble our commitment to fair housing, and take real, proactive steps. #FHAct50If work isn’t valued – if corporations shortchange workers with the help of lawyers like Mr. Ring and Mr. Pizzella – then Americans can’t earn their way to a better life for their families, no matter how hard they work. We must reject these nominations.Patrick Pizzella and John Ring - two of the President's nominees for key labor positions - have spent their careers working to strip workers of their rights, defending corporations accused of mistreating workers, and trying to undermine collective bargaining.We need to outlaw pay discrimination based on gender by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act → https://t.co/bLyB7JOvtqOn average, women have to work 3+ extra months to earn what their male counterparts earn in a year. That's not just a women's issue, that's an economic issue. 

No matter your gender, you deserve equal pay for equal work. It's that simple. #EqualPayDay.@ConnieSchultz, it is a joy to be your husband. To many more years of bliss – happy anniversary. -SB https://t.co/iykmlWTueCCongratulations @SenDuckworth! Connie and I are so excited for you, Bryan, and Abigail.

It must consist of three parts:
•1 - education and prevention, 
•2 - treatment, and 
•3 - recovery.”WATCH LIVE: in his speech at @TheCityClub, Sherrod’s calling for a major public health campaign to address the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/lqfh6RHF4XGunnery Sgt.

Our economy does better. #NPHWUnions like @CWAUnion, @SEIU, @Teamsters &amp; @AFTunion are demanding answers during their contract negotiations: how much money is going toward wage increases, and bringing back jobs from overseas? And how much is going to C-Suite paychecks &amp; stock buybacks? https://t.co/r6qLH6Sb4L.@justcapital_ studied how corporations have spent their tax cut so far – their nonpartisan analysis determined that 57% of the windfall's gone to shareholders, and a measly 6% has gone to workers.

So much for a tax cut for the middle class.

As we work to bend the arc of our moral universe a little further toward justice - as he did - we remember what he said about that arc: it’s long. It’s arduous, it’s uneven &amp; it’s never easy. #MLK50Congress created the @CFPB to serve as a strong, independent cop on the beat to protect consumers from the kind of financial fraud and abuse that caused the Great Recession.

For too long, Ohio communities have been desperate for the federal government to step up and provide the necessary resources to effectively combat the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/HpNog7zTTLThanks to Stoneman Douglas students who met with the team in my office last week.

Customers and servers should not have to subsidize companies that refuse to pay decent wages.This omnibus thankfully blocks @USDOL’s proposed rule that would force workers to forfeit their hard-earned tips to employers – it’s not a perfect solution, but it gives workers permanent protections under the law.I think you need to take responsibility and get things right. HUD’s mission is too important to do otherwise. And getting things right means fighting for the funding needed to help more people in this country get a roof over their head. -SBInstead of taking responsibility, Mr. Secretary, you seem to want to blame others – your wife picked out the furniture without knowing the price, your spokesman said something but not you, you shouldn’t be blamed for not listening to your ethics lawyers, the press is unfair....So it is disturbing to read about one controversy after another at the Dept – ethics lawyers ignored, procurement guidelines scoffed at, whistleblowers facing retaliation, anti-discrimination efforts downgraded, key positions filled based on patronage rather than competence....The Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, plays a critical role in the success of our housing market, our communities, our families and our goals as a nation.WATCH LIVE: Sherrod questions Secretary Ben Carson over HUD controversies during the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee oversight hearing. https://t.co/QtPKc91uhfBy investing in local communities and supporting law enforcement through the INTERDICT Act, we can better address the opioid crisis in our state.For too long, Ohio communities have been desperate for the federal government to step up and provide the necessary resources to effectively combat the opioid epidemic.
