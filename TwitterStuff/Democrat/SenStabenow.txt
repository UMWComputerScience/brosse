Congratulations to the Mesaros family’s Barvarian Bakery &amp; Restaurant in Oscoda for 40 great years of tasty treats!
https://t.co/vMYzcSgUIBGreat news today for the Soo Locks! After a long bipartisan effort, we are one step closer to moving this important project forward. https://t.co/beREFxgTaDIt’s great to see the Willis Early Childhood Center in Kingsford investing in the health of our children with a beautiful, brand-new school garden. https://t.co/nvbbPR463HAmazing to see three of our beautiful #PureMichigan beach towns in America’s top ten! https://t.co/D5qJMDM7eBMajor victory - by reaching across party lines and working together, we just passed #FarmBill18 that has Michigan on every page and provides certainty to our farmers, families and rural communities!The Farm Bill is one of the largest investments in our land, water, and Great Lakes. #FarmBill18 supports outdoor recreation and our Michigan way of life. https://t.co/hBp9mjkhgoMy statement on the retirement of Anthony Kennedy and the Supreme Court vacancy —&gt; https://t.co/x1Iycv50fRFor a farmer in Michigan, a year of hard work can be lost in a day. The bipartisan #FarmBill18 helps Michigan farmers succeed despite all the risks they face. https://t.co/ot3COY9EuTMichigan’s small towns and rural communities are great places to live and raise a family. I made sure #FarmBill18 included new investments that will help create jobs and opportunities in every corner of our state. https://t.co/JMFTDglnX2I also asked HHS Sec. Azar if this administration is going to take action on outrageous rising drug prices like life-saving Naloxone. He did not have an answer. https://t.co/IA2UR1tqaqI also told HHS Sec. Azar that he will be held accountable for the safety and care of the more than 2,000 children in his custody as well as the actions to immediately reunite them with their parents.Yesterday in Senate Finance, I spoke out about the outrageous policy of separating children from their parents at the border. https://t.co/gSTmUsJqrjUnions helped create the middle class in Michigan by fighting for fair wages and working conditions. This #SCOTUS decision in #JanusvAFSCME is an attack on working men and women. Very disappointing.I’ve always said the Farm Bill is a jobs bill. Today, I urged strong support for our bipartisan #FarmBill18 in order to provide certainty for Michigan’s agricultural economy and the 1 in 4 jobs it supports! https://t.co/53SMDBExiVBy increasing the number of career counselors who are not only focused on college preparation but also the skilled trades, we can make sure all young people have the opportunity and the skills they need to get a good-paying job. https://t.co/D3GwtINTB7There are good paying jobs in Michigan in the professional skilled trades where you can graduate with no debt. Unfortunately, too many students and parents aren’t aware of these opportunities!I am committed to doing everything I can to bring in federal assistance as soon as possible and keep #CopperCountryStrong.I have never seen a more organized and dedicated all-hands on deck moment – very proud of the Houghton County community and their over 2,000 volunteers, first responders and community leaders that immediately went to work rebuilding after the horrible mud slides and water damage. https://t.co/euq9yLrxZdHaving a direct flight from Michigan’s capital to our nation’s capital is a major boost to Mid-Michigan’s economy. Very excited to announce that this route has been extended! https://t.co/8xYoSXLuCD✅Continue construction of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, a state-of-the-art research facility at MSU
✅Expand the Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly so we can honor more of our veterans 
✅Develop energy efficient trucks and vehiclesThe Senate voted on a bipartisan budget today that has important wins for Michigan, including funds to:
 
✅Improve health care facilities for our veterans
✅Take another step in our fight against Asian carp
✅Maintain our harbors, locks &amp; waterwaysFather John Phelps - thank you for 50 years of living the Gospel! @LifeDirectionsC https://t.co/6HfH5GlKMaYesterday, @SenGaryPeters, @RepJackBergman and I offered our strong support of any request by the State of Michigan for federal assistance in responding to recent severe flooding in the Upper Peninsula. Our thoughts are with the communities affected by the damage. https://t.co/x8kvC565D0It sure looks like President Trump is trying to overturn my ban on oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes. We will NOT let that happen! Read my letter to him here. https://t.co/JbqZuHd7MoThank you @LittleLobbyists for everything you’ve done over the past year to protect our health care. I’m honored to be your partner in this important fight! https://t.co/Ge6waFAmatI’m glad the Trump Admin listened to our bipartisan request and has released this study today. People have a right to know the dangerous health impacts from exposure to these chemicals. https://t.co/SXex7oZ9ObFor months, I have been calling on the Trump Admin to release a study on the health impacts of PFAS chemicals. Communities across Michigan are dealing with PFAS contamination but the Admin blocked release of a study that would shed light on health impacts https://t.co/Ym9YsmSH2oThe first bill I passed into law as a US Senator was a ban on oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes. If the Trump Administration thinks its Executive Order can open the door to drilling in our Great Lakes, they should know that we will NEVER let that happen!! https://t.co/VuiTrfgeLWA nuclear waste spill near the Great Lakes could be devastating to our health &amp; environment. I introduced an amendment tonight that urges the US &amp; Canada to work together to prevent Canada from constructing a nuclear waste storage site less than a mile from Lake Huron in Ontario.I talked to @RickAlbinWoodTV on To The Point about the threat to our Great Lakes and how I led the fight to restore every penny of funding. https://t.co/1TOr9OTtw4Today on #Juneteenth we commemorate the end of slavery and recommit to the fight for equal rights, opportunity and justice for all Americans.The bill includes a bipartisan amendment that overturns a Trump Administration decision to lift a ban on ZTE, a Chinese telecom company that violated US sanctions on Iran and North Korea and is a threat to our security and privacy. This provision needs to stay in the bill!We also included funding for upgrades to the A-10 fighter jet that will help keep A-10s operational at Selfridge Air National Guard base in Macomb County as well as funding to develop a Next General Combat Vehicle prototype at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren.In the bill, we increased support to address PFAS chemical contamination and are making important progress towards upgrading the Soo Locks.Last night, I voted in favor of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which passed out of the Senate and how heads to conference with the House. Our bill invests in our nation’s defense and gives our men and women in uniform a pay raise.Very scary conditions from devastating floods in Houghton and the UP. There is a lot of work ahead to assess the damage and rebuild. I will strongly support any state or local requests for federal assistance. Please be safe!Wishing all families and their loving father-figures a very happy Father’s Day! https://t.co/hcuTnNrtheThe situation on the border is cruel and heartbreaking. I am a cosponsor of @SenFeinstein’s must-pass bill that would end the separation of children and families. https://t.co/tOpUgv6DGcWhat a great kickoff to the Light Up the City campaign. Glad the community is coming together to keep Saginaw safe!
https://t.co/tDil9MF20oImpressive to see two very accomplished women in executive roles at @GM! Wishing Dhivya Suryadevara the best in her new endeavors as CFO!
https://t.co/fNqE0hmMH0Sending my best wishes to all Muslims and their families on this Eid! May your celebrations be just as delicious as they are joyous. https://t.co/UuSrs4yqlAYesterday my #SenateAg partner @SenPatRoberts and I passed our bipartisan Farm Bill out of committee. Looking forward to getting this done so we can provide Michigan farmers, families, and rural communities with the certainty they need. https://t.co/hu7VxREBBNEven if you get health insurance through your employer, this decision by the Trump Admin could affect you. Outrageous that their actions would let insurance companies deny you coverage or increase your rates because of a preexisting condition. https://t.co/UObD63wiQDGreat news – Senate moving forward on full funding for the Great Lakes next year, passing $300 million out of Appropriations Committee today. The bill also requires Trump Admin to release study on health effects of PFAS chemicals.From Ypsilanti to Ortonville – there are so many great strawberry farms for families to visit this summer season! @freep https://t.co/87AqLDGDh8@SenateMajLdr The Farm Bill is THE example of what we can get done working together, Democrats and Republicans. Looking forward to passing it before the full Senate!Congratulations @ABC12WJRT for receiving this national honor from @NABTweets! A well-deserved recognition of your hard work!
https://t.co/fBEWk9YuMeJoining colleagues today to introduce the Workers’ Freedom to Negotiate Act of 2018. This bill strengthens protections for our Michigan workers, including the right to collective bargaining without fear of retaliation!Not much beats the feeling of walking barefoot in Lake Michigan or running your hands through the sand on the shore. Glad to see our Grand Rapids Southwest Community Campus students had the chance to make it to the beautiful P.J. Hoffmaster State Park!
https://t.co/hPCJRnACCYToday, I worked across party lines to pass a Farm Bill out of committee that will provide certainty for Michigan farmers, families and rural communities. I’m proud to say the 2018 Farm Bill is a bipartisan victory that has Michigan on every page. #FarmBill18 https://t.co/XtQHg1cLiMIt is terrible to see the Trump Administration taking Michigan families back to the days when being a woman was considered a preexisting condition or when a patient had to pay more because he or she had cancer or another serious disease.
https://t.co/5jekoMBNxDThis week, we added a bipartisan provision to the Senate National Defense Authorization Act to restore the ban on ZTE. It is critical that this stays in the final bill. https://t.co/pmT9rxL2mXThat’s why I was very concerned when President Trump decided to side with ZTE and China and overturn the ban. That decision threatens our national security, our economy, and our privacy.These were the right things to do. ZTE’s actions were deeply concerning and many national security leaders feared that the company was looking for a backdoor way to spy on our military and our businesses.Soon after, the Pentagon banned the sale of ZTE phones on military bases amid fears the phones could be used to spy on our troops.Earlier this year, the Commerce Department issued a ban on Chinese telecom company ZTE for violating our sanctions on Iran and North Korea.This week, the Senate is voting on the National Defense Authorization Act, which provides important support for our troops and includes my provision to complete a critical study that will move funding for the Soo Locks forward.Great look at the Midland Tridge – a beautiful landmark spanning the Chippewa and Tittabawassee rivers for almost 40 years!
https://t.co/1AVSEDq7Yn#NetNeutrality protections are officially over today. We voted in the Senate to repeal this terrible FCC decision. House should take action now! https://t.co/UOdVkf9d7EGood news - thanks to additional funding we secured in the recent federal budget bill, the Army Corps will invest $57 million to maintain the Soo Locks! Still need funds to build a new lock, but this is good progress.Anthony Bourdain’s recognition and love for Detroit has always been appreciated. Anthony was and is an inspiration to us all – he will be deeply missed.
https://t.co/SyT008DrGtToday, #SenateAg Chairman @SenPatRoberts and I released our bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill, a true victory for Michigan’s diverse agricultural economy that will support our farmers, families, and rural communities! https://t.co/xF2BRaoexm https://t.co/iaacYQuvilOur Michigan workers and manufacturers can out-build, out-work and out-think anyone but they need a level playing field to succeed. My Keep Buying American Act ensures compliance with Buy American laws that protect our workers and manufacturers. https://t.co/1AtM4YGRzNGreat to meet Collin and Bailey from Kalamazoo’s Gaige School — who won 2nd place in the 2018 Toshiba/National Science Teachers Association #ExploraVision Awards! Congrats again on your well-deserved award! https://t.co/YVhBZ5P6OwA String of Pearls is a beautiful piece of Elmira’s history – made even more special by the history between Jeanne and Chris Polak. @petoskeynews 
https://t.co/dXzAATsEiHAccess to the internet is not a luxury; it’s a necessity for people in Michigan. Last month I joined Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to overturn the rules repealing #NetNeutrality. Today I’m calling on Speaker Ryan to schedule a vote NOW in the House. https://t.co/lSaMHQTSHHUpdate  –&gt; The Senate is taking up the National Defense Bill this week and I’m working hard to get my Keep Buying American Act passed as part of this legislation.I agree 100%. Thanks @SenTinaSmith! I’m so glad you’re in the Senate! https://t.co/YTackWqu2WThat’s why today I introduced legislation with @SenatorBaldwin @ChrisMurphyCT @SenTinaSmith @SenJeffMerkley requiring the Trump Admin to release these Buy American reports immediately! https://t.co/VlHTVU2jtCThe reports have been completed but they haven’t been released to the public or to Members of Congress! The public has a right to see whether our Buy American laws are working, and if they’re not, what actions can be taken to strengthen them.Last year, Pres. Trump issued an executive order calling for federal agencies to report on how they can better comply with our nation’s Buy American laws, which protect American workers and manufacturers.Sunshine’s story is a true inspiration. Even in the toughest of circumstances, she remained focused and motivated. I’m excited to see the many more great things she will accomplish! https://t.co/4VQWOxVl6qSouth Arm Market is a great addition to East Jordan’s Main St. – congrats on your recent opening! 
https://t.co/VOipLCMrUUI’ve worked closely with @MarkHackel and local officials in Macomb to urge @SecElaineChao to provide this needed funding. This shows, once again, that when we work together we can get things done for Michigan!Excited to announce over $97 million in federal funds to make critical upgrades to Mound Road!

Hope everyone is able to get out and enjoy these summer activities.
https://t.co/VhJnLEpj66Rising prescription drug costs are one of the top issues I hear about from MI families. There are actions we can take NOW to lower costs like passing my bipartisan bill to make sure you’re paying the lowest price at the pharmacy &amp; my bill letting Medicare negotiate lower prices!Why are seniors stuck between a rock and a hard place right after prescription drug companies just got a massive tax break? https://t.co/Xo4JJZn3ZmCelebrating new MI jobs at Achates Power’s new location in Farmington Hills!

This means that rural hospitals and providers can get paid for their services and continue to see patients.The VA Choice program was designed to make sure veterans can receive services close to home in a timely way but it has failed many of those it was intended to serve. Today we’re taking an important step to reform the VA program and improve care for our men &amp; women in uniform.Thank you @NASCAR Cup Series driver @JamieMcMurray for honoring Staff Sergeant Scott Sather’s life and dedication to his country.

Great ideas for how to improve health care and provide better support to our veterans transitioning from the military to civilian life. https://t.co/jUVd6Bkg0IExciting to see Detroit hosting the @FRCTeams FIRST competition – an amazing way to bring together thousands of our brightest young minds to create innovative robots and inventions.
https://t.co/eidzhWGKrwA special look at all the work going into the opening of the @GrandHotelMI. https://t.co/yofioJETHSWhat a powerful and important memorial recognizing the horrors of lynchings throughout our history. https://t.co/mTuVDk36YuWe are almost there! Looks like the end of the snow is finally in the horizon for us. Hope everyone has plans to enjoy the upcoming beautiful warm weather! https://t.co/xIaD4BvmmbI’m glad Ronny Jackson has decided to withdraw his name from consideration as VA Secretary. Our Michigan veterans deserve better. We need a head of the VA who has the experience and expertise to improve care and fix what’s broken. https://t.co/29bu4VJtelCongratulations to Officer David Renteria on his retirement. His service to keep the Jackson community safe over the last 25 years will forever be appreciated. https://t.co/UdNUajc3DYCongrats to the Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District’s Career-Tech Center on receiving the @CTEWorks Excellence in Action Award.

Also, congrats on graduating, Tori! https://t.co/YtvcPG46TjIncredible – this picture from the @Space_Station captures our Mackinac Bridge from an amazing vantage point. https://t.co/V4w4RSAuQCKyle Duncan’s terrible record makes him unfit for a lifetime appointment on the Fifth Circuit. I strongly oppose his nomination! https://t.co/19PIgrDcl4What an interesting discovery in Lake Erie – curious to see what the National Museum of Great Lakes is able to find out! https://t.co/eNCxqQtDcVIn Michigan, we know the value of our air and water- especially our Great Lakes. This #EarthDay, let’s remember to enjoy the beauty of our great state and recommit to protecting the environment and our natural resources! https://t.co/vFENrxJmwzWhat a privilege to join Western International High School Junior ROTC cadets for a proud military tradition- Dining Out! TY for your leadership &amp; service! https://t.co/2fiFKvdilBProud of all the Michigan students who are speaking out against gun violence today. I stand with you! https://t.co/lpf1FFH4CEGreat to see you @SenDuckworth and welcome Maile to the Senate Floor! https://t.co/Wq3XrFx2uOToday in @SenateFinance I called on the Trump Admin to negotiate the lowest price for naloxone. It’s outrageous that this life-saving drug was once available for $1 and, as the opioid epidemic has become a national crisis, drug companies have dramatically raised the price. https://t.co/yA6iRCEyUhI’m horrified by the abuse these young women and men suffered at the hands of adults they trusted. We’ve recently passed into law some important steps to strengthen protections for young athletes but there is much more to do. https://t.co/HPYZYjKtzVGreat to meet with Michigan's own Wesley Lutz today. Proud to have him serve as Chair of the @NADAUpdate. https://t.co/UFuvAQxakgIt's unfortunate that House Republicans are pushing a farm bill that abandons the bipartisan approach that allowed us to pass the current #FarmBill. As Ranking Member of @SenateAgDems, I am committed to writing a bipartisan bill that continues to put Michigan first.Today I joined 38 of my colleagues to call on Scott Pruitt to resign. We need someone at the EPA who will stand with us to protect our air, water, and Great Lakes! https://t.co/ZC3mB0gcDbToday I called on the Administration to take immediate action to reduce the price of naloxone so we can get this life-saving drug in the hands of more people. This will save countless lives! https://t.co/OtYK2pso6QOur Michigan police officers, firefighters, and first responders use naloxone to reverse the effects of opioid overdoses and save lives. Even though naloxone has been around since the 1970s, the price keeps going up. That’s outrageous!I did not support Mike Pompeo to be CIA Director and I will not vote for him to be our Secretary of State. He is not fit to be our head diplomat or to represent American values around the world.Very sad to hear of the passing of Barbara Bush. My deepest condolences go out to her entire family.Great to meet with @MiLaborers. Thank you for all you do to stand up for working families in Michigan! https://t.co/5U1Pp9j1NJIf you’re as outraged about the Trump Administration’s new proposal to expand #junkplans as I am, you can share your opinion here: https://t.co/EUw4HOhp6B. The deadline to submit a comment is April 23rd!I want to work w the Trump Administration to lower health care costs so that you can get the care you need. Unfortunately, the Administration has a new proposal that would take us back to when women could be charged more or you could be denied coverage for a preexisting conditionThere’s no question health insurance is too expensive for too many families in Michigan. That’s why I’ve been taking on Big Pharma so we can lower the cost of prescription drugs, the biggest driver of health care costs! https://t.co/LQibLNWemFA great piece on mental illness and the importance of understanding its impacts. I will continue leading the effort in the Senate to increase mental health funding and expand care. https://t.co/QYDPwXw2QbSo glad I had the opportunity to present the Congressional Badge of Bravery to the very deserving @EatonCoSheriff Deputy Andrew Jenkins last week.
https://t.co/SpeMSqX3v8As I have said before, Enbridge should NOT be reopening Line 5 until the visual inspections are complete! Our Great Lakes are too important. We need to know the safety and integrity of the line were not compromised following the reported damage!
https://t.co/RoAAWJZJe4Such an amazing achievement – congratulations to Desiree Linden from Michigan on becoming the first American woman to win the women’s division of the Boston Marathon in 33 years! https://t.co/gxTPFbqMNA.@SenGaryPeters and I called for Line 5 to be shut down until it can absolutely be verified it is safe. Protecting our Great Lakes must be our top priority. It was the right call for PHMSA to press Enbridge to shut it down during this bad weather! https://t.co/R0KviTyPlSCongratulations! https://t.co/jocABjEZZ2.@EatonCoSheriff Deputy Andrew Jenkins heroically saved the lives of three people who were trapped in a burning home. I was so honored to present the Congressional Badge of Bravery to him today with @SenGaryPeters.

Congrats to our honorees! https://t.co/j5hoKULKzNChef Alex Young and his team are working very hard to get this local business up and running – very exciting to see The Standard preparing to come to life this April in Ann Arbor. Best of luck as the grand opening approaches! https://t.co/PMRIhxAjxBIt’s time we have someone at the EPA who will stand with us to protect our Great Lakes and all of our beautiful land, air and water resources!This is also why I plan to vote against Andrew Wheeler to be Deputy EPA Administrator. Have no confidence that he will do more than Pruitt to protect the Great Lakes.Time after time, Scott Pruitt has tried to gut funding for our Great Lakes and undermine protections for our air and water. I never supported Pruitt to begin with and now it’s time for him to step down.The plans to transform West Riverfront Park are beautiful – what a great space to enjoy downtown Detroit. https://t.co/3S9c5o6RZ1Congratulations to Voyager in Ferndale on being named one of the 2018 Restaurants of the Year by @FoodandWine magazine.

Excited to enjoy the coming warmer nights watching the lit up night-sky. https://t.co/vdfBPQeQSEWe must continue to do all we can to close the gender &amp; racial #paygap today and everyday – not only in Michigan but all across our country! #EqualPayDay https://t.co/38wd0uTVSfRural communities in the UP and all across Michigan need access to high-speed internet and better water infrastructure. That’s why I led the effort to include new rural investments in the recent budget bill. @miningjournal https://t.co/tvMR6dii4iVery sad to hear of the passing of my friend Tony Trupiano. He was a courageous voice for working people in Michigan.Congrats @SenDuckworth on the beautiful addition to your family.

The price of one of her medications tripled without warning last year from $683 to $2,236! I'm focused on bringing down the outrageous cost of prescription drugs and thank Linda for sharing her story with me. https://t.co/FmFzYCc6kmBig Pharma spends more on lobbying than any other industry to stop competition that would lower prices. So drug prices continue to skyrocket for seniors and families. I announced new legislation today in Detroit and Flint to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Enough is enough! https://t.co/T51rwaN9E5I continue to stand up to the drug company lobbyists and special interests who spend millions to keep the cost of your medications so high. It is wrong and my plan would lower the cost of prescription drugs – making a major difference for our Michigan families. https://t.co/QdvCPXdVy9Today, I am announcing my plan to lower prescription drug prices at events across Michigan! https://t.co/DngjB9l89AThank you @MitchAlbom and @sayplaydetroit for touching so many lives and showing the power of caring! https://t.co/O61LEjAzcPThe dedication Superintendent @dmcdav has given to his students at @BerkleySchools is incredible.
