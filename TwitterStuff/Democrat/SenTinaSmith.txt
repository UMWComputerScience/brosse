Some children who have been separated from their families as a result of the Trump Administration are so traumatized they can’t speak. So we are raising our voices—and taking part in marches across the country—for those who have been scared into silence. #FamiliesBelongTogetherHey @SecNielsen &amp; Trump Admin—have you seen Trump's @StateDept report warning against separation of children from their families, citing serious health effects? Exactly why I’m calling for a hearing on health impacts of your zero-tolerance policy. We must help separated kids. https://t.co/9v1vAKYcQyPushing the #FarmBill through the Senate. Tackling skyrocketing Rx prices. Fighting to help separated families. If you want a rundown of what I’ve been up to, sign up for my newsletter by emailing newsletter@smith.senate.gov. Read my June newsletter here: https://t.co/1yLMIS15Mi https://t.co/kIGDnsjLZfWhen somebody buys a plane ticket, they should trust it guarantees travel &amp; that they’ll get home. It’s that simple. But this yr, Sun Country Airlines stranded travelers, leaving them scrambling. I’ve intro’d a bill to hold airlines accountable. More here: https://t.co/zw98vx2AcsLGBTQ rights are human rights. Proud to cosponsor @SenSherrodBrown’s resolution recognizing June as LGBTQ #Pride Month, and fully committed to advancing the fight for equality. https://t.co/TFVLCCyD5z https://t.co/bjgeMNYKJuBig news for Minnesota: today the 2018 bipartisan Senate #FarmBill passed. This is a great example of how the Senate can get things done when we work together. I’m so proud to have been able to make sure Minnesota priorities were included. https://t.co/OHH760Ud8rHorrified by today’s shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Peace be with those injured and those who have lost loved ones. Courage to those in Congress who could pass commonsense reforms to help end this violence.My staff &amp; I held 30+ listening sessions w/ Minnesotans across the state to make sure MN priorities are in the #FarmBill. Grateful for their input—it helped me get key provisions incl. in the bill. Today I took to the Senate floor to highlight these wins: https://t.co/3ezXoZHdsD https://t.co/xViYqpqQZPThat’s right. Drug companies have spent hundreds of millions of $ to rig the rules &amp; protect huge profits. From Jan. thru March of this year the drug industry trade group—PhRMA—spent nearly $10 million on lobbying, breaking their quarterly record. Obscene. I’m here to fight back. https://t.co/GtWkOJbvORThis is a pivotal moment. Justice Kennedy’s retirement means the stakes are high for choosing a replacement committed to the Constitution &amp; protecting basic rights. GOP must be held to their own standard: with E-Day so close, voters should choose who provides advice &amp; consent. https://t.co/PBqkvO0NJ1Always great to see you and hear your passion for robotics, @FIRSTteam1816. And yep, you’ve got it right: I’m a big advocate for #STEM education, and strengthening our nation’s workforce programs. https://t.co/sbXbKVH11qI hope he keeps his word, especially as the White House seeks to make funding cuts to clean energy research at the Department of Energy. Our economy and our planet can’t afford to take this step backwards.https://t.co/17maUDyCt2Yesterday I asked a nominee to be in charge of renewable energy if he believes that we should have affordable, reliable and clean energy that’s good for public health and mitigates effects of climate change. He said yes. https://t.co/auL726wyMdDeeply disappointed in Supreme Court's decision to weaken this key protection for public sector employees. We must fight against far-right, corporate-funded, special interests which backed this case—and keep defending working families across the country. https://t.co/GfMxotNjj1The EPA needs to step up and ensure that our nation meets the 19.88 billion target, and I plan to hold them accountable for doing so. https://t.co/BmBVZvsxndBut if the EPA is going continue to allow refineries to get around RFS requirements by granting them waivers, the amount of ethanol and other renewables used in the nation’s fuel supply will fall far short of the target levels announced today.A strong Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) is critically important to Minnesota, where ethanol produced from corn creates an estimated $6.7 billion in economic output and supports almost 18,000 jobs across the state.Today’s decision by the Supreme Court goes against the founding principles of our nation and defies our core beliefs. We must keep working to help all people demand respect, freedom and dignity in the same spirit on which our country was founded. https://t.co/a9AJmNOUM7Taking the time to listen may seem like a lost art in Washington, but it’s how I do my job every day. Today I sat down w/ MNs from CHS, a farmer-owned coop, to hear concerns abt the current climate of uncertainty &amp; how it may hurt farmers’ bottom lines. Thanks for the visit, CHS. https://t.co/IRAHUx4MxzThree years ago today, the Supreme Court confirmed what Minnesotans have known for years—love is love. But making sure all Americans have equal rights and protections guaranteed by the Constitution? We're still fighting. I'm with you, and I'm not going anywhere. #MarriageEqualityIn my recent op-ed, I talk about bringing my office to Minnesotans so they can have a voice in Washington. Read more here: 
https://t.co/dSCFzdLTgCI want to help Minnesota continue this progress. That’s why I’ve introduced a legislative roadmap for the energy section of the #FarmBill to help #MNAg deploy renewable energy and energy efficiency. My bill will also strengthen programs that have already seen success, like REAP.Minnesota's a leader in renewable energy and it’s always great to see folks working to keep us moving in the right direction. Check out how @CityofRedWingMN is working to encourage locals to explore energy efficiency and renewable energy options:
https://t.co/EZhZNNspV3End of May: President says prescription drug companies will make “voluntary, massive drops in prices” in 2 weeks.
Early June: None of the 10 major pharma companies @SenWarren &amp; I reached out to provide meaningful specifics on a plan to lower Rx drug prices.https://t.co/tpx6HnR7BBA MN mom came to one of my prescription drug discussions and brought her daughter’s insulin pens. She walked me through what it would cost to get the same life-saving medicine in other countries. And then told me how much she pays here in America. The discrepancy is shocking. https://t.co/g6ENbhcibpCongrats on the fourth consecutive win, @minnesotalynx! Whether I’m at a game in Minnesota or watching from afar, it’s always exciting to cheer you on. And it was great to see you all not too long ago in Washington.
https://t.co/fb3tk7aiBm100% agree, @USATODAY. The North Shore Scenic Drive along Lake Superior is breathtaking. #OnlyInMN https://t.co/wW2nwgCcNbNot everybody needs to attend a 4-yr college. But everyone should be able to find good-paying jobs. I have a bill focused on this &amp; here's another great MN effort to help students: https://t.co/sbjsXqiISCFacilitating conversations about mental health is an important step toward eliminating the stigma that prevents too many, incl. students, from seeking care. I intro’d a bill to create a nat’l commission to help address mental health concerns students face. https://t.co/JQFcqp91fCCongratulations on this well-deserved award, @CTUL_TC, and thank you for your steadfast commitment to improving working conditions for Minnesotans. Everyone should be able to live and work with dignity. https://t.co/xwofNyhO3HWatch this powerful interview with Dr. Marc Gorelick on why it’s urgent that we reunite families and stop family separations now: https://t.co/p8kxaLaF8OWe know that ripping kids away from their families can be devastating for children, &amp; the damage caused by these separations can last a lifetime. I'm calling on the Senate Health Committee to hold a hearing on the health &amp; well-being of detained children. https://t.co/QVhnXVVG2YThat’s ludicrous. Pharma companies need to be held accountable for jacking up the price of drugs that people need to survive. I’m working to take on the pharma industry &amp; rein in drug industry profits that are borne on the back of patients who are paying too much for their drugs.A MN woman recently showed me insulin pens that she bought for her daughter in other countries around the world. She told me that prices for the pens ranged from $8 to $18. In the U.S., she explained that this exact insulin pen—made by the same manufacturer—costs her family $140.Let me tell you why the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs is alarming to me, and why it should be to you, too. https://t.co/Qzx2OkTxesDisappointed the House passed a partisan #FarmBill. Thanks to my Minnesota colleagues who voted against this bill. I’m fighting to protect programs that help feed Minnesotans and Americans in the Senate Farm Bill. https://t.co/kQTYXni41PWe have to ensure that the more than 2,300 children who have already been separated are safely reunited with their families and receive the care they need as soon as possible.

https://t.co/oOqYWuhYu5I’m calling on leaders of the Senate Health Committee to hold a hearing because we must hold the Trump Administration accountable for the 
negative consequences resulting from the traumatic stress children experienced as a result of Trump’s policy.If we don’t address trauma inflicted on children, we pass that trauma on to future generations.I want to give more MNs the freedom to work, compete, &amp; live their lives the way they want. That’s why I led an effort to build out #broadband to rural areas &amp; upgrade internet speeds. I’m glad it was included in the #FarmBill—it’s 1 of many things we need to address this issue.A Minnesotan named Adam wanted to open a high-tech 3D printing company in his rural community. Thanks to reliable internet access, he was able to start his business in Gibbon, MN—a small town of about 750 people. https://t.co/E0ec9Hx4RICongrats to Eric Koser (@EKphys), a physics teacher at Mankato West High School, for being selected to help map the ocean off the coast of Alaska aboard @NOAA ship Rainier. Sounds like an exciting experience that you’ll be able to share with your students back in Minnesota. https://t.co/9jmurFRftnIf we’re serious about helping veterans access the care and benefits they earned, then we need to sit down and listen to what they have to say. 
https://t.co/5wahFZcjlu https://t.co/Bgs9JfYn67I asked @SecretarySonny to extend the enrollment period for the Margin Protection Program so we could get more Minnesotans signed up. I’m glad he heeded my call. Dairy farmers: there are 2 days left to enroll in this program, which helps folks face difficult yrs &amp; prevent losses.Yesterday I listened to some inspiring students from @moundsviewhigh and @MapleGroveSrHS describe their innovative business ideas, which have earned them spots in @JAUpperMidwest’s Company of the Year Competition in Washington. Best of luck. https://t.co/UTNnN0HzreMental health services need to be available to Minnesotans where and when they need them. @umash_umn shared info with my team today at a meeting in St. Paul about #AgResilience, and I'm supporting a bill that would bolster addressing mental health needs in the ag community. #MNAgGrateful for the opportunity to welcome students from the Boys and Girls Club (@BGCA_Clubs) of White Earth Reservation to Washington today. Enjoy your @CloseUp_DC trip to our nation’s capitol. https://t.co/AIavzlgVt3We lost my mother to Alzheimer’s not quite 2 yrs ago. It was a long &amp; difficult good bye so meeting w/ @alzMNND today &amp; hearing their stories was important to me for many reasons. Millions of Americans are affected by this disease &amp; I’m pushing to ramp up funding to help #EndALZ. https://t.co/dWppjWmuQaThat’s why I’m sending my staff across MN to hear about challenges veterans face in securing earned benefits, &amp; explain how I can advocate on their behalf. If you’re a MN veteran who needs help accessing benefits, please know that you can always call my office at (651) 221-1016.We need to address veterans' health needs, and that includes making sure they’re able to access the care and benefits they earned.We can only help people when we take the time to listen to them. Yesterday in Waseca my staff heard two Vietnam veterans talk about the difficulties they face when it comes to accessing mental health services. https://t.co/RAm4oh67SfThis stop is part of my state wide effort to make sure Minnesotans know how I can go to bat for them when they need help working with a federal agency. Services are open to the public—no appointment needed. For more info, feel free to call my office at (651) 221-1016.TONIGHT→ My staff will be at Inter-County Community Council (121 2nd Street West) in Thief River Falls from 6 to 8 p.m. to meet with Minnesotans who need help working with federal agencies..@SenateMajLdr, that’s wonderful news! When can we expect you and your fellow Republicans to join all 49 Dem Senators in supporting @SenFeinstein’s bill to fix this? And assume you’ll be calling that up for a vote this week? https://t.co/e4VOoCVa0yImproving access and increasing opportunity for Americans to build the lives they want. That's what I work on doing each day in this job, and that's why I fought to include help for vets to get more info about apprenticeships, job training, &amp; education included in the #FarmBill.That’s why I led an effort to build out broadband to rural communities and upgrade internet speeds. I was very pleased to get it added to the #FarmBill. This is just one of many things we need to be doing to address this issue.I couldn’t agree more. If we’re going to build an economy that works for everyone, we must prioritize high-speed internet. Expanding rural broadband is about helping all Minnesotans connect and compete.Today at a @FarmFoundation event in Faribault my staff heard Minnesotans—including Bruce Miller of @MNFarmersUnion—say that broadband is critical to supporting rural farmers and agribusinesses. https://t.co/y7ekPBysG8We have a humanitarian crisis at our border manufactured by President Trump and his team. We are using cruelty to children as a public policy, and it’s unconscionable. Today I spoke with @PoppyHarlowCNN about the need for immediate action to stop this. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/XGSVx6kQqDThis is a moment of moral responsibility—and I hope clarity—for our country. In just a few minutes, I’ll be talking with @PoppyHarlowCNN about the need to #KeepFamiliesTogether. Tune in to @CNN.I’ll be on @CNN around 10:15 AM ET to discuss the cruel practice of separating children from moms and dads—both at the border and with families already in our own country—with @PoppyHarlowCNN.But she’s denied that this is happening at all, and then said that she “wouldn’t apologize” for what’s happening to families. @SecNielsen has lost the credibility and the moral authority to lead this agency. https://t.co/h3A7kQ6BTkAnd despite what @SecNielsen claims, this is a policy of this administration, who has repeatedly and publicly said they would implement it, calling it a “zero tolerance” policy—a policy Secretary Nielsen is responsible for overseeing.Some 2,300 children were separated from their parents at the border between May 5 and June 9. That is plainly wrong. It runs counter to who we are as a country. https://t.co/0yy1IZwOZbI agree. As a Senator, I take holding this administration accountable very seriously. I believe @SecNielsen has lost the credibility to lead DHS, and that she needs to step down.“I expect to be held accountable…” That’s what Homeland Security @SecNielsen told Senators during her confirmation hearing in November.It’s an honor and a privilege for Minneapolis to be in the running to house the @USArmy’s new Futures Command. Minneapolis offers tremendous assets and an innovative, entrepreneurial energy that would go above and beyond to support the Army’s goals. 

https://t.co/DKjOkqRZduMinnesota’s proud tradition of @USArmy service was forged by the First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Battle of Gettysburg. Today, thousands of service members in Minnesota uphold that legacy.Don’t worry about making an appointment—they’re free and open to all. If you have any questions, feel free to call my office at (651) 221-1016.Today my staff will be in Wadena at Mahube-Otwa Community Action Partnership (311 Jefferson Street South) from at 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. to work one-on-one with Minnesotans who may need help.Navigating federal agencies like @DeptVetAffairs, @CMSGov, @USCIS, @SocialSecurity, or the Passport Agency can be overwhelming. That’s why my office is always here to lend a hand.Workforce training partnerships help companies find the talent they need, and help Minnesotans develop the skills for jobs without taking on loads of debt. It’s an idea that works, &amp; it's a win for Minnesota's economy and working families.The #skillsgap is leaving employers w/ good jobs that they can’t fill. Today I met w/ folks at @newflyer to discuss efforts needed to help biz find trained workers. I have a bill that would help tackle the #skillsgap by expanding workforce training partnerships btwn schools &amp; biz https://t.co/mXws9KJAXXThe bill also approves $1 billion for the TIGER program—or what’s now called BUILD—and $2.55 billion for Capital Investment Grants, both of which will help communities improve and strengthen the safety and reliability of Minnesota’s transportation infrastructure.This bill includes many housing initiatives that I have supported, like HOME, CDBG, and NeighborWorks. This bill sustains past investments in affordable housing—something that’s sorely needed in Minnesota and across the country.That’s why I’m happy to share that the Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a bipartisan spending bill that provides a whopping $71.4 billion investment toward our nation’s housing, transportation, and other programs that build our economy.If we want to get to work on rebuilding our roads and bridges and modernizing our schools, hospitals, and housing, then we need the federal government to make real and meaningful investments.I am committed to supporting Minnesotans who serve our country, as well as their families, during and after deployment. If you’re a Minnesota veteran who needs help accessing benefits, feel free to call my St. Paul office at (651) 221-1016.This year marks 153rd Anniversary of the Civil War. At the outbreak of the war, MN was the newest state in the Union &amp; only had a population of about 180k but it was the 1st to volunteer troops. The 52 service members I addressed carry on our state’s proud tradition of service. https://t.co/hfeDLbACBzToday in St. Cloud I told 52 service members, who will soon be deployed to Kuwait, and their families how grateful I am for their service and the sacrifices they make for our nation. https://t.co/0IgmtXPzbbTeachers shouldn’t unfairly have their grants switch to loans because of minor paperwork errors. https://t.co/Sc54P86mLRIn Minnesota, over 4,800 of these grants—which help students pay for college if they plan to teach in a high-need field, like #STEM, in a low-income school—were changed to loans between 2009 and 2016.Investing in teachers can help ensure that every student has access to a high-quality public education. That’s why I’m urging @BetsyDevosED to take action to help teachers whose TEACH Grants were unfairly converted to loans. https://t.co/m5UEvscLDQ)I’m a proud sponsor of @SenFeinstein’s Keep Families Together Act because no child should have to face the terror of being unnecessarily ripped away from their family. #FamiliesBelongTogetherAs many Muslims in Minnesota and around the world celebrate completing a month of fasting and reflecting, I wish you and your loved ones Eid Mubarak.Congrats to @CoachPhill on being promoted to Director of Coaching at USA Curling! @usacurl, you picked the best curling coach out there—and a pretty good Minnesota Congressional Delegation Hotdish Competition judge, too. https://t.co/Nvkd9Q5p9IAnd I introduced The HELP Separated Children Act to protect children when their parents are caught up in immigration enforcement actions with commonsense measures. We have to stop cruelty from becoming a hallmark of our immigration policy. https://t.co/VJnKcKy4CmYesterday I joined @amprog to discuss the harmful effects of family separation, and what I’m doing to address it. I am a proud cosponsor of @SenFeinstein's Keep Families Together Act, which would outlaw the inhumane practice of unnecessarily separating families at the border.The Trump Administration’s separation of children from families at the border is absolutely horrifying. Whether this happens at the border or during immigration raids, separating kids from their parents is cruel.I recently talked with the MN mom who had to live through this. Her son, Alec, passed away last year. We need to immediately address the unforgiving prescription drug price hikes that led to Alec’s death, and that are hurting too many other Minnesotans. https://t.co/Gzq5JNfJ4OSounds unimaginable, right? But this happened in Minnesota and happens to families across the country who are left making impossible choices between their medications and other basic needs.But he’s struggling to afford his medications: the $1,300 prescription drug refill he needs to treat his type 1 diabetes is out of reach. In order to make ends meet, he begins rationing his medication and one month later he’s dead because he didn’t have enough insulin.Imagine this. Your 26-year-old son is out on his own and doing great. He’s employed, has a place of his own, and a whole lifetime ahead of him.Minnesota’s home to beautiful parks, and we’ve got a new coin to prove it! Glad my staff attended the unveiling of a @usmint quarter that celebrates Voyageurs National Park (@VoyageursNPA) today in International Falls. https://t.co/AHns82ZBpKSat down w/ folks from MN Grain &amp; Feed Assoc. to talk all things #MNAg—incl. efforts I fought for on behalf of Minnesotans in the bipartisan #Farmbill. I’m going to push hard to get this bill signed into law because our farmers, communities, &amp; rural businesses are counting on it. https://t.co/5eaCGVg8qVJust met Christine, who used to live in MN &amp; who survived the horrific tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Thanks, Christine, for demanding action on gun violence. We must pass into law reforms to keep guns away from dangerous ppl &amp; prevent mass shootings https://t.co/KUCnXXvPOTI always enjoy listening to students share what’s on their minds. Glad I got to chat about #NetNeutrality and renewable energy with Minnesota high school students visiting Washington with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (@NRECANews). https://t.co/FhCjq8TTOSThat’s outrageous. I plan to keep making a full-court press on protecting people’s pensions. We must ensure that retirees in Minnesota—and across the country—don’t have the rug pulled out from under them. https://t.co/l71KdkQrPPIn today’s bipartisan select committee on the pensions crisis, a family business owner told me how the ripple effect will extend far beyond employees if we let pension plans fail. She’s right. This crisis could hurt families, take down businesses, and depress entire communities. https://t.co/IQEWSxhgaeToday I helped get the 2018 #FarmBill over a major hurdle by helping pass it out of the Senate Ag committee, and I’m pleased to share that this bill includes many of the provisions that I fought for on behalf of Minnesotans. https://t.co/VfyvSe8sfVJust had a great visit with students from Farmington’s Dodge and Boeckman Middle Schools. Appreciated their thoughtful questions about education and health care, and their enthusiasm for our nation’s capitol. Enjoy the rest of your visit, @district192! https://t.co/MdOSY5VanZMy staff heard about the negative impact of low commodity prices on dairy farmers’ bottom lines. It’s a problem too many Minnesotans are facing, and the reason why I fought to get a measure in the #FarmBill to improve the dairy safety net. https://t.co/QQWvwQqpSJThe bipartisan #FarmBill may have passed out of committee today, but that doesn’t mean the ag meetings stop. Today I had my staff attend @MNFarmersUnion’s rural dairy discussion in Mazeppa.Thanks to all the Minnesotans who met w/ my staff &amp; me to discuss the #FarmBill—from farmers &amp; ranchers to nutrition experts, energy efficiency leaders, &amp; rural dev. folks. Your input helped me get key efforts that matter to #MNAg included in the bill. Watch my opening remarks: https://t.co/HfhnTfblRwWe’re one step closer to passing a bipartisan #FarmBill—would be a big win for Minnesota. Today the Senate Ag committee met to hammer out the details of the bill, and we voted the bill out of committee. Next stop, a vote in the full Senate. https://t.co/EHwozR9nZkThat’s why I am committed to taking on big pharma—and the big money behind them—to prevent companies from price gouging patients because this hurts Minnesota families. https://t.co/UnKAsyNHTXThe drug industry has rigged the system to maximize their profits and they have spent staggering amounts on lobbying in the process—hundreds of millions of dollars—just since the start of this administration.After the President released his Rx drug plan, pharma stocks shot up. You don’t need an MBA to know stock prices ↑ when investors think profits are going to rise. This isn't surprising given a former industry lobbyist was 1 of the lead White House staffers negotiating the plan.Earlier today I questioned @SecAzar, Secretary of @HHSGov, about what I see as the Trump Administration’s inadequate plan to address skyrocketing drug prices. It doesn’t do enough lower drug prices and rein in pharma company profits.Drug companies have been driving up prices, and Minnesotans are paying too much for their prescriptions. Everywhere I go, I hear from families who are stuck choosing between their medications and other things they need. That is wrong and I am here to fight back. https://t.co/PFfH9bwiu7Super PACs and other dark money organizations spent some $1.4 billion in the 2016 election. That is profoundly troubling. I’m taking to the Senate floor to talk about why I’m fighting to reform our campaign finance system. Watch live: https://t.co/yJzlgfF3KSThese are just 3 of the many stops my statewide Constituent Services Tour is making, because I want to help as many people as I can. Services are open to the public—no appointment necessary. For more information, please feel free to call my office at 651-221-1016.TODAY my staff will be in Plymouth at Missions Inc. (3409 E. Medicine Lake Road) from 3 to 5 p.m. On Wednesday, they’ll be in Duluth at my office (515 W. 1st St Suite 104) from 3 to 5 p.m. On Thursday, they’ll be in Grand Marais at Cook County Courthouse (411 W. 2nd Street).Plymouth, Duluth, and Grand Marais—those are the places I’m sending my staff over the next three days to meet one-on-one with residents who need help working with federal agencies like @DeptVetAffairs, @CMSGov, @USCIS, @SocialSecurity, or the Passport Agency.Two years ago today, 49 lives were senselessly taken by a heinous act of violence at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. We must #HonorThemWithAction by working to dismantle anti-LGBTQ violence, hatred, and discrimination, and by finally addressing gun violence.Today @SenWarren and I called on @SecAzar to address our concerns about the admin’s inadequate proposal. The high prices of prescription drugs are hurting countless Minnesotans, and this crisis deserves an honest, problem-solving response.
 
https://t.co/VXHTyuiqehThe Trump Administration’s plan does not go far enough to help Americans struggling with high drug costs, thanks to the role that former drug industry employees/ lobbyists reportedly played in the crafting of the plan.In his campaign, @POTUS made bold promises about reducing drug prices. But @SenWarren and I are gravely concerned that the public has been misled, that his drug pricing proposal released last month breaks those promises, and would do little to reduce out-of-pocket drug costs.Wishing a very happy birthday to @MooreMaya! As a @minnesotalynx fan (yep—I’m a season tix holder), it was an honor to meet you last week in Washington to celebrate your team’s 2017 @WNBA championship win. You are a true leader and an inspiration, both on and off the court. https://t.co/0LKrdnrPpsI’m grateful for the input that these folks—and all MNs—have shared with me regarding #FarmBill priorities. I plan to be a fierce advocate for MN farmers, ranchers, rural development leaders, energy efficiency folks, and nutrition experts during the markup of the #FarmBill.Today I asked my staff to update these Minnesotans, including folks from @MNFarmersUnion, @MNFarmBureau, @YoungFarmers, @mnmilk, @HungerSolutions, and @MinnesotaDHS, on the bipartisan #FarmBill proposal.I created a #FarmBill working group—comprised of Minnesotans with a deep understanding of farm policy and how it impacts our state—to advise me on things like crop insurance, research, conversation and energy, and to help me push for #MNAg priorities in the #FarmBill.#NetNeutrality allows the internet to be a pillar of innovation and opportunity that fuels Minnesota’s economy. It’s woven into the fabric of our internet, and it should remain that way. Join me in the fight. Keep making your voices heard to help #SaveTheInternet.I’ve pressed @SpeakerRyan to schedule a vote, and will continue to do so, because a free and open internet is necessary for families, students, and businesses to thrive.We’ve already made real progress in protecting a free and open internet in the Senate by passing a historic bipartisan resolution to overturn @FCC’s #NetNeutrality repeal. Now, the House needs to do the same.I’m deeply disappointed by the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality, which goes into effect today. 

But I have a message for the @FCC: we’re not backing down. The fight to #SaveTheInternet will continue.I'm a proud supporter of the #PaycheckFairnessAct, which would help address this persistent problem, and I will keep fighting tooth and nail to help bring equal pay to women in Minnesota and nationwide.On this date 55 years ago, the #EqualPayAct was signed into law, affirming that all women are entitled to equal pay for equal work. But today, too many women still face pay inequities and discrimination.And I sit on the bipartisan select committee on the pensions crisis, where I'm working to find solutions so Minnesota retirees, like the ones I met today, don't have the rug pulled out from under them. https://t.co/5WgRVzhxwzToday I joined Save Our Pensions and @Teamsters120 in Blaine to give them an update on my work in Washington. I'm a cosponsor of @SenSherrodBrown's Butch Lewis Act, which would provide loans to troubled pension funds like Central States. https://t.co/IQrcyb3AiUIt's outrageous and flat-out wrong that more than 22,000 Central States retirees in Minnesota, and numerous Minnesotans in other underfunded pension plans, could face a significant loss if the multiemployer pension system is allowed to fail.I believe that after years of work, Minnesotans who paid into a pension deserve to retire with peace of mind that their retirement is secure.I fought hard for a spot on the Senate Ag Committee because I know how important agriculture is to our state. Know that I plan to be a fierce advocate for Minnesota priorities in the Farm Bill debate, and that I'm going to work hard to get this done. https://t.co/HYhG6iAdYfI want to thank the dozens &amp; dozens of Minnesotans who met w/ my staff &amp; me to discuss the #FarmBill—from farmers &amp; ranchers to nutrition experts, energy efficiency folks, &amp; rural development leaders. Your input helped me get key efforts that matter to #MNAg included in the bill.Beyond that, it will support conservation efforts, provide funding for ag research, and expand resources for our beginning and organic farmers.Just as importantly, it will help feed thousands of Minnesota families and school children, expand the production and use of renewable energy, bolster rural economic development, build out broadband to rural communities and guide our state’s important forestry industry.The #FarmBill touches the lives of virtually every American and is critically important to Minnesota’s economy. This bill will not only lead our farmers, ranchers and rural communities into the future, but also sustain tens of thousands of jobs across our state.Minnesota, I have some good news to share with you—next week we’ll be taking up a bipartisan Farm Bill proposal in the Senate Ag Committee. This is a big win for our state. https://t.co/hJ62ilCPBDBut as a @mnwild fan, I'm already looking forward to next year. You know, "first-ever #StanleyCup Championship" sounds pretty good to me. https://t.co/Ch9crP8tLzI also want to pay tribute to the @GoldenKnights' amazing and unprecedented run to the finals in the team's very first year. The exciting final series, and the @Capitals victory, capped off another great season.From the #StateOfHockey, I send my heartiest congratulations to the @Capitals, who won their first-ever #StanleyCup Championship last night. They did so in impressive fashion with a 4 to 3 win over the Vegas Golden Knights. https://t.co/wIgjFhfzS7I joined several other senators in pressing President Trump to stop his Administration’s inhumane policy of separating children from their parents at the border. No child should have to endure such trauma.       https://t.co/Hk3Our6COBHis foster mom told @nytimes, “for two days, he didn’t shower, he didn’t change his clothes. I literally had to peel the socks off his feet. They were so old and smelly,”… “I realized that he didn’t want anyone to take anything away from him." 

That is deeply unsettling.The @nytimes shares the story of Jose, a 5-year-old boy from Honduras who was separated from his father at the United States border in El Paso.  Jose cried himself to sleep  for nights after being separated from his father.We have to stop cruelty from becoming a hallmark of our immigration policy. https://t.co/VuvAJ0cVT9The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is intended to increase domestic biofuel consumption in the U.S. I will stand strong against any attempt to count ethanol exports towards the RFS. @EPAScottPruitt’s plan is a terrible attempt to weaken policy that would hurt Minnesota farmers.But the fight isn’t over. To #SaveTheInternet, @SpeakerRyan must schedule a vote on the measure to overturn the @FCC’s #NetNeutrality repeal. Today I joined @SenateDems in demanding that he do so. https://t.co/SrGxqKgnecA free and open internet is necessary for families, students, and businesses to thrive. That’s why last month I joined many of my colleagues in helping pass a historic bipartisan resolution to protect #NetNeutrality.Like many Minnesotans, I am a huge fan of our state parks and trails—some of the best in the country. Congrats to @mndnr on their completion of a campground at Lake Vermillion-Soudan Underground Mine State Park. Glad my staff was able to attend today's dedication. https://t.co/bw14VQnDfxGroundbreaking. Iconic. And Minnesotan! Remembering Prince today on what would have been his 60th birthday. https://t.co/KSKWYZYSMWI’m so glad I got the chance to help celebrate at Payne Elementary, and thanks for your leadership both on and off of the court. And that jersey you gave me? It’s already hanging outside my office. https://t.co/ymSkGAQMd1The @minnesotalynx are the definition of strength and teamwork. Last year, they won their fourth (!) @WNBA Championship in the last 7 years. And today, they took part in a day of service in Washington. https://t.co/B3twb0Iz3XAs I said in my first Senate floor speech yesterday, great things can happen when we have women in leadership roles. Take a look at how @RhodaMhiripiriR, Superintendent of Hopkins Public Schools (@Hopkins270) is making history in Minnesota. https://t.co/RaxAKwHacNThese programs represent only a small fraction of the bill’s costs, but generate large returns—more than $5 billion since their introduction. If we’re serious about helping out our ag communities—which we should be—then we need to prioritize the energy section of the #FarmBill.And this week, I led a bipartisan group of Ag committee members to call on Senate Ag Committee Chairman @SenPatRoberts and Ranking Member @SenStabenow to ensure improvements and strong funding for programs in the energy section of the #FarmBill. 
https://t.co/0VVZicpHEKThat’s why I introduced a legislative roadmap for the energy section of the #FarmBill that would help ag communities in Minnesota deploy these technologies. My bill would help strengthen programs that have already seen success, like REAP. https://t.co/nPjgbTHkliI believe a strong 2018 #FarmBill should include opportunities for #MNAg to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, which can help Minnesota farmers, producers, ag businesses, and rural business cut costs, create jobs, and strengthen communities.Every Wednesday when the Senate is in session, I host a coffee for Minnesotans visiting Washington. I want to make sure we have enough coffee on hand for #CoffeeWithTina, so please RSVP if you’re planning on joining me: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMgSpending time with Minnesotans and hearing them share their stories over a cup of coffee is a great start to the day. Thanks to everyone who joined me today for good conversation and coffee from Chickadee Coffee Roasters in @DetroitLakesMN. https://t.co/L68ej5zrBP#ICYMI: I recently sent my monthly newsletter to keep in touch with Minnesotans and let them know what I’m up to. Catch up on my latest “Notes From The Capitol”, &amp; feel free to sign up to receive my next newsletter by emailing newsletter@smith.senate.gov. https://t.co/JiGtVZS0D4 https://t.co/5WhyTe2hgsWhen we have more women at the table—we all benefit. That’s what I told @Morning_Joe when talking about my first Senate floor speech this morning. https://t.co/JNMtLcNrN1 https://t.co/WGdicc6oGDI’ll be there! Can’t wait to see you and the rest of the @minnesotalynx. https://t.co/4TmEDCpqVPIn just a few minutes, I'll be on @Morning_Joe to talk about my first Senate floor speech and discuss the latest in Washington. Hope you'll tune in on @msnbc.When women are empowered to contribute, we all benefit. We’re seeing it more and more here in the Senate. And I’m proud to be part of that. Watch highlights from my first Senate floor speech here: https://t.co/2wdl3NjOpjMy first Senate floor speech is about the path that got me here, and the contributions women can make when they have the freedom to do so. WATCH: https://t.co/1XsEfvw12YMy presence here in the Senate will always be seen by some as a symbol of the “broader conversation” we’re having about the experience of women in America. And so I thought I might as well go ahead and say my piece about where I hope that conversation goes.Hope you’ll join me by watching my floor speech—live—here on my Facebook page at approximately 10:45 AM CT: https://t.co/QfVkeKnrGtTomorrow I’m delivering my first speech on the Senate floor to talk about the path that got me here, and some of the injustices that hold women back—many of which start with the policy that gets made right here in DC.The fact is that a lot of problems have endured because women haven’t been at the table here in Washington.I was the 51st woman to take the oath of office as a United States Senator—but we’ve had 50 different men just named Charles. And nearly half of all the women who have ever served in the United States Senate are serving right now.Unacceptable. What we’re seeing happen at the border is awful, and we need to protect all children. https://t.co/2Z1hKjlj5nAnd in the meantime, you can read this month’s newsletter here: https://t.co/JiGtVZS0D4What am I working on in Washington? Sign up for my newsletter and you’ll get a rundown on some my latest work straight to your inbox. Just email newsletter@smith.senate.gov and I’ll make sure you get on the list.Today I led a bipartisan call to extend the enrollment period (which is set to end tomorrow) for the Margin Protection Program (MPP)—a vital program for Minnesota dairy farmers. More here: https://t.co/xWqcRmhsK4Thanks, @ChrisPolicinski, for both your work at @LandOLakesInc and in the community. Wishing you many happy days ahead on your bicycle! https://t.co/aeQOBzssAPThanks, @MNFarmersUnion, for contributing to today’s discussion on locally grown food at @TheGoodAcreMN. https://t.co/q0ECwAt9DXThank you for hosting, @TheGoodAcreMN, and for your commitment to helping Minnesota farmers and Minnesota’s food system. https://t.co/oWit7b70TgThanks to everyone who joined me today to talk #MNAg. I’m going to fight to support our local and regional food systems across Minnesota in the 2018 federal #FarmBill debate. https://t.co/UQ7h2ZHAH7I got the chance to tour @TheGoodAcreMN’s kitchen and couldn’t resist sampling fresh kimchi made from locally grown ingredients. A lot of the food made in this kitchen goes to Minnesota farmers’ markets and coops. https://t.co/LFxLcvNMkwMN consumers are driving a growing demand for locally grown food &amp; that demand is creating jobs &amp; economic development across the state. Today at @TheGoodAcreMN I met w/ MNs involved in local &amp; regional food systems to discuss this trend &amp; hear their priorities for the #FarmBill. https://t.co/SSM2JMvmbeAnd more recently I introduced a bill that requires pharmaceutical companies to reveal how they’re using the billions of dollars in tax breaks they received as a result of the recently passed Republican tax bill.For example, my first bill would help prevent big pharmaceutical companies from keeping affordable generic drugs out of the hands of Minnesota families and seniors.I’m working to bring down prescription drug prices and hold large pharmaceuticals accountable for jacking up prices at the expense of patients, like Lija’s daughter.Her story is alarming, but not unique. It was among those I heard today during a meeting I held w/ medical experts, researchers, &amp; families in MN to discuss skyrocketing Rx drug prices. Her experience is just 1 example of the ways Americans are being hurt by high Rx drug prices. https://t.co/vUYSSYX1BBToday a woman named Lija showed me several insulin pens that she bought for her daughter in countries around the world. Prices varied from $8 to $18. The exact same insulin pen cost her $140 in the US, even though it was made by the same manufacturer. https://t.co/DbbeELmnd4Families are struggling to afford the prescription drugs they need. https://t.co/5n0iVTKCx9I always say that Minnesota is home to some incredible colleges and universities, but today I don’t have to. This news speaks for itself. https://t.co/bK3F9kIpWdFor Las Vegas Knights: @nateschmidt29 (St. Cloud). For Washington Capitals: @TJOshie77 (Warroad), Matt Niskanen (Virginia), @shane_gersich9 (Chaska), and @TBoyd93 (Hopkins).  Thanks for representin’. #StanleyCupThey don’t call Minnesota the #StateOfHockey for nothing. The #StanleyCup Finals started last night, and once again players from Minnesota are on the rosters of the two finalists.I’m leading a bipartisan bill w/ @SenDougJones &amp; @SenatorRounds to create a rural health liaison at @USDA who'd be responsible for advocating for rural health across the federal govt, &amp; ensuring agencies work together to tackle health care challenges.https://t.co/xNehSf2uWmFor example, there’s a @USDA program that can help rural areas build &amp; expand health care facilities. If we had someone making sure USDA &amp; @HHSGov coordinate on these efforts, we’d have a better pulse on the needs of communities &amp; a better sense of how agencies can collaborate.The US Department of Agriculture is a strong advocate for rural communities in Minnesota and across the country, and I think there’s a greater role for the @USDA to play in improving health care in rural Minnesota.When I meet with farmers, businesses, and communities in rural Minnesota, health care is a top priority—they feel like the federal government should be doing more to help people in rural areas get the care they need. And I agree.Workforce training partnerships help companies find the talent they need, and help Minnesotans develop the skills for jobs that are available right now without taking on loads of debt. It’s an idea that works, &amp; it's a win for Minnesota's workforce, economy, and working families.“Every year more Minnesota companies have said that the labor shortage is their No. 1 issue”, writes @duluthnews. 
 
I have a bill that would help tackle this problem by expanding workforce training partnerships between schools and local businesses. 
https://t.co/L8izG6lARjIt's so exciting to see #robotics growing in Minnesota. Congratulations to the small-town alliance of Greenbush Middle River (@GMRRobotics), Frazee-Vergas, and Eden Valley-Watkins on winning the @MSHSL robotics championship! 
https://t.co/x9oFUgdCuJThat’s why restoring buildings in the Upper Post at Fort Snelling to create affordable housing for veterans is such a great idea. This historic place has so much resonance for Minnesota, and could be a big help for some of our veterans. 
https://t.co/RpFfNeYW7SWhen I travel across the state to talk with veterans, housing almost always comes up. Minnesota veterans need more affordable housing options.Yes, hero is right. Great to have Minnesotans like you, Everett, in our state. https://t.co/4sugDC84iUI’m committed to helping Minnesota’s veterans get the benefits and care they’ve earned, like access to health care and mental health services. So please know that you can always turn to my office for any kind of assistance. I’m here to work for you.​ https://t.co/r0LPZe7aPTOn #MemorialDay, I think about my father-in-law Mark Smith who served in World War II. I think about the sacrifice he made when he was just a young man, and all of the young people now who step in at a time when they are just starting their lives—and just how much we owe them.This year was particularly special at Fort Snelling because it was the first time in 35 years that a flag was planted at each one of the markers, and I want to thank the more than 5,000 volunteers who made that happen as a tribute to our veterans.One of our most solemn duties is to take care of the men and women who serve in our armed forces. Today I joined veterans, service members, and their families at Fort Snelling National Cemetery and the Minneapolis Veterans Home to honor our country’s fallen troops. #MemorialDay https://t.co/4GHbavCOyVI’m leading the effort to help kids who are being separated from their moms and dads who are facing arrest, detention, and removal actions. I introduced the HELP Separated Children Act this week because we need to fight for these children and their families. https://t.co/ssMk1gqQo6I hope we can get this bill passed into law, because it’s what’s best for children and families. https://t.co/bakoxTMgMoThe HELP Separated Children Act steps up efforts to keep vulnerable children safe with commonsense measures, like allowing parents to make calls to arrange for the care of their children and ensuring that children can call and visit their parents while they are detained.Since I first heard kids were being cruelly ripped from their parents in this way, I committed to protecting children whose families are swept up in immigration enforcement. I’ve introduced legislation that makes good on my promise, but more than that, it’s the right thing to do.Children shouldn't be suddenly abandoned at home or at school without information on their parents’ whereabouts, but we’re seeing that happen to kids with moms and dads facing arrest, detention, and removal actions.After hearing from farmers and ranchers about the real concerns of livestock haulers, I helped introduce a bipartisan bill that keeps animals’ wellbeing in mind and is good for haulers in Minnesota and across the country. Learn more here: https://t.co/LkzKqcDdCPWe support our livestock producers, and we also need to make sure we’re extending that same support to the men and women who are making sure their products are able to get to market.Wishing a very Happy Birthday to @SenAmyKlobuchar, an incredible colleague and friend. https://t.co/HktzlKTKKOThe Rural Health Liaison Act would create a position to make sure there's coordination between the Ag Department (@USDA) and other federal agencies, especially the Department of Health and Human Services (@HHSGov). I'll be pushing to get this including in the upcoming #FarmBill.When you work with someone, you communicate with them so you're both on the same page, cover all the bases, and get stuff done. The same concept goes for the bipartisan legislation I helped introduce with @SenDougJones and @SenatorRounds this week, the Rural Health Liaision Act.That’s what I, @PPFA , @Guttmacher, and @PattyMurray are talking about on today’s call to discuss Trump Administration’s move to change the #TitleX family planning program.The new proposed rule to restrict #TitleX family planning funding is an affront to women. It’s as if our President and VP want to be in the doctor’s office whispering over the shoulders of health care providers about what they can and can’t tell women about reproductive care.Land of 10,000+ lakes, and land of two of the best park systems in the nation. 

Big congrats to @CityMinneapolis and @CityofSaintPaul’s park systems (@MplsParkBoard &amp; @CityofSPP) for ranking no. 1 &amp; 2 on @tpl_org's 2018 #ParkScore Index. #OnlyInMN.  https://t.co/YAcYTDDOlhThat’s why I intro’d a bipartisan bill w/ @SenToddYoung to improve public health preparedness by ensuring fed agencies advance this approach. I’m glad that key aspects of our bill are reflected in legislation that passed out of the Senate Health Committee today. https://t.co/uAKllWocTIA One Health approach—the idea that human and animal health are linked, and that both are affected by changes to our environment—can help us prevent and respond to outbreaks like this.Minnesota was hit hard by the avian flu outbreak a few years back. It hurt the ag economy and had significant human health implications.Glad to meet with local leaders from Sherburne County and @StearnsCountyMN to discuss regional priorities, from #broadband and transit needs to human trafficking. Thanks for making your voices heard in Washington. https://t.co/TDoQFnGCO6Highway 23 is a critical thoroughfare for much of greater Minnesota. By upgrading and investing in our infrastructure, we can support economic growth and address clear safety issues affecting our communities. https://t.co/7FBB8dV73XAnd this afternoon, I spoke with some Minnesota @steelworkers about their priorities and what we can do together to protect and strengthen the rights of workers in Minnesota and across the nation. https://t.co/gpACV4Z0gGToday I rallied in solidarity with @steelworkers to protect workers’ rights. United Steelworkers helped build the middle class in our country, and these hardworking Americans deserve a fair wage, safe working conditions, retirement security, and basic respect and dignity. https://t.co/o3MN77TO7XMinnesota’s performing arts scene never ceases to impress me. 

Congratulations to Twin Cities actor Dame-Jasmine Hughes on winning an Obie Award for her performance in Aleshea Harris’ (@AHarris1361) play “Is God Is.”
https://t.co/Tce9y0sWleEMS providers do everything they can to help us &amp; we should do the same in return. My office recently hosted an EMS listening session in Virginia, MN to hear abt barriers rural EMS providers face. As co-chair of Senate Rural Health Caucus, I’m committed to supporting their work. https://t.co/vsHmlo8ZcyGrateful for our state’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers—brave and dedicated individuals who work around the clock to respond to emergencies across Minnesota. #EMSWeekA fair wage. Safe working conditions. A chance to retire. Today I’m joining @steelworkers, some of my Senate colleagues, and advocates to fight for workers’ rights. Watch live: https://t.co/asAWsYNQMpA new proposed reproductive health rule is an affront to women. Family planning is key to women’s economic opportunity, &amp; I trust women &amp; families to make their own decisions about their reproductive health care. More on Trump Admin move to change Title X https://t.co/yvlnyKhtN1Proud to work with you and @SenatorRounds on this initiative, @SenDougJones. I believe that the Rural Health Liaison Act could make a real difference in helping improve access to health care in rural Minnesota and rural areas across the country. https://t.co/vbLB84EPiwAs a leader of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I’m proud to intro a bipartisan bill with @SenatorJones and @SenatorRounds to better coordinate rural health resources across the federal govt &amp; improve health care delivery for rural areas. https://t.co/mM18cQVkxSWhen I meet with farmers &amp; rural business &amp; community leaders, the first issue that comes up is health care. And I think the @USDA &amp; @HHS, together, can do more to help rural communities take on health care challenges &amp; make sure that every family can access the care they need.It’s unfair to treat people like this. Minor administrative mistakes like missing a paperwork deadline should not yield catastrophic financial nightmares for our teachers and make them worry about their futures as they tirelessly work to prepare our kids for their lives.But I’m deeply concerned by recent news that these TEACH Grants are being converted into loans—with back interest due—often times because of what sound like minor errors in paperwork. https://t.co/VGcE655cBeFederal TEACH Grants help students pay for college if they plan to become a teacher in a high-need field, like science or math, in a low-income school. Objectively, this sounds great.Every student should have access to a high quality public education, and investing in our teachers early on can help make this happen. 
https://t.co/gJYhPmC5v5That’s why I open my office to talk with Minnesotans over a cup of coffee every Wednesday when the Senate is in session. This week I’m serving @Stumbeano’s Coffee from Fergus Falls. If you’re going to be in town, please join me. RSVP here: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg https://t.co/7mU3pJh9RHBeing Lt. Governor was like being invited into Minnesotans’ living rooms. My office might not be as cozy as a living room, but I want make sure that you get a big Minnesota welcome when visiting our nation’s capital. https://t.co/M4RRW5G3gAI’m committed to supporting all MNs who serve our country while in uniform and after they come home. I recently sent my staff to meet w/ women veterans in the greater Rochester area to hear about specific issues that they face, and to explain how I can advocate on their behalf. https://t.co/oLkIxMfMw7This is part of taking my office on the road across Minnesota &amp; explaining how I can help cut through red tape when Minnesotans need help with a federal agency. Services are free &amp; open to all MN residents, no appointment needed. Feel free to call (651) 221-1016 with questions.TODAY: My staff will be in Virginia at City Hall (327 1st Street South) from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to meet one-on-one with locals who need help working with federal agencies like @DeptVetAffairs, @CMSGov, @USCIS, @SocialSecurity, or the Passport Agency.My friend and former colleague, @GovMarkDayton, is committed to helping working families and upholding the progressive legacy of Minnesotans like late Senator Paul Wellstone. Congrats, Mark, on receiving @steelworkers’ Senator Paul D. Wellstone Award today.That’s why I intro’d the SOIL Stewardship Act, which would help MN farmers create &amp; maintain plans to improve soil &amp; water quality on their farms. @RepTimWalz has intro'd the companion House bill, &amp; I’m ready to get this commonsense bill passed into law. https://t.co/ClephcGfXLWhen it comes to conservation, we need to help make sure our farmers have the opportunity to start these efforts, and to keep them going long into the future to protect the environment and sustain their farms. #MNAgEvery time I walk into the Senate Agriculture Committee, I think about the priorities Minnesotans have shared with me and what we need to focus on for a good, bipartisan Farm Bill—things like rural development and strong farm programs like crop insurance and conservation support.Happy birthday to Al Franken, a progressive champion I’m proud to call my friend.That’s wrong, and this Supreme Court decision is dangerous to working people everywhere—Congress needs to step in because we need to safeguard Americans’ access to the courts. https://t.co/5fcVDNVVUaThe ability of every American to have their day in court is a core American value. But in order to avoid being held accountable when workers face exploitation or harassment, or when consumers are taken advantage of, corporate interests have embraced the use of forced arbitration.The point of having a minimum wage is that it keeps up with the cost of living in this country. That hasn’t happened. https://t.co/rgDjY68kkHThe federal minimum wage hasn’t been raised in a nearly a decade. Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago. And prices for everything from milk to prescriptions has skyrocketed.One of the proudest things I did as part of the Dayton Admin was help raise the minimum wage in the state, which hadn’t been raised in 9 years. Now, I’m proud to back a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024, which was intro’d by @SenSanders &amp; @PattyMurray.A discussion on college affordability should include college students. 

Grateful for the input @StudentsUnited shared with me on how I can help tackle this issue. We need to do more to make college affordable. https://t.co/Ajmb0aiBC0Thank you, @LeadMNPresISAAC, for participating in my roundtable on college affordability. It was great to talk to students at 2 and 4-year colleges about how we can make college more affordable for students across Minnesota. https://t.co/4WoRRUpsMAMy bill would require Rx companies to fully disclose how they’re using the tax breaks. I hope that this will give us a foundation of information to help us determine what we can do to lower drug costs for Minnesota families. https://t.co/SO22XcmPUr#ICYMI: I introduced a bill to hold Rx companies accountable because high Rx prices are hurting Minnesotans. The GOP tax law gave Rx companies a windfall that could help ↓ Rx costs. But how much of that $ is actually being used to ↓ costs and how much is going to CEOs?Supporting a diverse and growing farming industry is good for families and good for our economy, and that’s exactly what the Assist Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Act aims to do. Thanks, Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe. #MNAg https://t.co/YXpaPbGDvIAs a member of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, it’s great to see @usdaRD helping rural communities in Minnesota make sure families can get the health care they need.Take Renville County Hospital, which received @USDA Rural Development $ to help build a new facility and install telehealth equipment to provide 24/7 physician access. 

https://t.co/ibV7cktedQI’m always proud to share the innovative work Minnesotans are doing to help people in rural areas overcome the unique challenges they face when it comes to accessing quality health care.Another devastating school shooting. No community should have to endure this. Still learning the facts. Thoughts are with everyone in Santa Fe, TX. We must find the conviction to finally address gun violence.Glad my staff heard Tracy &amp; Trisha, co-founders of Little Eagles Childcare Center, discuss their work to bring more child care services to the greater Rochester area at @CEDAUSA’s meeting. I’m gathering input on MN’s child care shortage so I can address it in a meaningful way. https://t.co/FHlNq6u2AAIn April I met a Minnesotan who said that she and her husband are spending 27% of their income on child care for one child. That’s absurd. Minnesota needs more affordable and quality child care options for working families.I stand with my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation who voted against efforts in the House to weaken our state’s sugar industry yesterday and I’ll keep fighting for our Minnesota sugar beet farmers in the Senate. Supporting #MNAg should always have bipartisan support.We need to do all we can to tackle Rx drug prices, &amp; part of this is knowing just how many dollars are going into the pockets of investors &amp; shareholders rather than consumers, &amp; what action—if any—pharmaceutical companies are taking to lower drug prices. https://t.co/IOjCWZfVPAToday, I’ve introduced a bill to help hold pharmaceutical companies accountable. https://t.co/SO22XcmPUrSkyrocketing prescription drug prices are hurting MN families—just last night, I spoke with a MN mom who lost her son bc he was rationing his life-saving insulin. This is wrong, and it comes at a time when pharmaceutical companies are taking in staggering profits.Ahead of yesterday’s historic vote to protect #netneutrality, I spoke about why a free and open internet isn’t just nice, it’s necessary for families, students, and businesses to thrive. Keep sharing your stories about why we all need a free &amp; open internet. https://t.co/gR5AbaWbnOThis is unacceptable. I’m calling for an investigation of the payments Novartis made to Pres. Trump &amp; I’m asking leaders of the Senate Health Committee to hold a hearing w/ the CEO of Novartis as the key witness. We all deserve more answers. https://t.co/aCz4qDTAS1 https://t.co/vZnZZG2TKuThese payments raise concerns that Novartis entered into a financial relationship w/ the President’s personal attorney in order to not only win over the new Admin, but also prevent the Admin from meaningfully tackling skyrocketing prescription drug prices.And last week, Novartis confirmed that it paid nearly $1.2 million to Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, through a shell corporation, Essential Consultants.Novartis is a giant pharmaceutical company that generates billions in profits. 

Nine of its widely-used drugs alone generate more than $1 billion in sales, and some of the company’s products come with eye-popping, six-figure price tags.

https://t.co/V56H2retjAThe head of the CIA must reflect our country’s moral values—incl. respect for human rights. Haspel’s involvement in America’s torture program—a shameful chapter in US history—demonstrates alarming judgment. Haspel shouldn’t lead the CIA w/ this dark part of history on her record.Last week I joined anti-torture groups (including The Center for Victims of Torture, which is headquartered in Minnesota), faith leaders, and members of Congress to explain why Gina Haspel should not lead the CIA. https://t.co/fvwaOOU95a#RamadanMubarak to all who are observing. Wishing you a blessed and peaceful month.Today we took a big step forward in protecting a free and open internet. My full statement on the Senate #NetNeutrality vote: https://t.co/48Jbo4qgSGThat’s why I’m backing a bipartisan bill to help small businesses access facilities at national labs. The cost of investing in necessary but pricey equipment needs often holds small biz back. This bill will help spur innovation &amp; help MN small biz thrive. https://t.co/V2vyOZDHYyAnd as former small business owner myself, I want to make it possible for more small businesses in Minnesota and across the country to access the resources they need to ensure their businesses create good jobs, grow the economy, and help them and their families thrive.From the Post-it Note to the Pacemaker. Minnesota has a long history of innovation. When I host roundtables and meetings across the state, I’m struck by the many ways Minnesotans are developing innovative products to address important issues.We just reached a major milestone in the Senate to protect #NetNeutrality, but the fight isn’t over. Millions of Americans fought to establish net neutrality protections, and we need you to help keep them in place. Keep making your voices heard to help #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/9fPGubtSznDuring #NationalPoliceWeek we recognize our law enforcement officers and honor those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Glad I got the chance to thank some of Elk River’s officers for their work today, and thanks to all officers who serve Minnesota. https://t.co/QZ8EHwTs2PGreat news for the #StateOfHockey: Minnesota—with its wealth of talented women players—now has a professional women’s hockey team! Looking forward to catching a game, @WhitecapsHockey. https://t.co/N4Kt15QtbsToday’s vote for #netneutrality in the Senate is a vote for more freedom and more opportunity for Americans to survive—and thrive. https://t.co/ITgTcztgG13 MILLION. That’s the estimated # of visits Minnesotans made to food shelves last year, &amp; we know that many people still lack access to food. I told Rabbi Kravitz of @theAdath &amp; @MAZONusa that I’ll be fighting proposed cuts to programs in #FarmBill that help feed Americans. https://t.co/ZixqSzkxClAnd thank you, @IBMRochMN, for recognizing the importance of workforce skills. I intro’d a bill to help MNs develop the skills they need—without taking on loads of debt—by expanding workforce training partnerships. It's an idea that works, and we should get it passed into law. https://t.co/18KxP7fXX8Instituting strong and enforceable standards could stop serious injuries and save lives in across the country. https://t.co/QmI83aI1xrGiven that more than half of the 17 million new vehicles sold in the United States each year have keyless ignition systems, I’m pressing the NHTSA to move quickly to establish safety standards for vehicles with these systems to ensure meaningful consumer protections. https://t.co/IeKVGW4KLXThat’s why today—after a recent news report detailed how ppl are being seriously injured or dying as a result of exposure to exhaust from vehicles with a keyless ignition—I’m urging @NHTSAgov for action to protect families from these preventable accidents. https://t.co/Ubhxvb1dR3I want to help keep Americans safe. So when I see the need to make sure safety measures keep pace with tech advancements, I’m ready to get to work.Millions of Americans’ retirement security depends on the work of the PBGC. We need someone there who knows what they’re doing. Trump’s nominee to head the PBGC has zero apparent expertise on pensions. https://t.co/YZzvRi5yTcI’m fed up, too. I’m working to address the high price of Rx drugs in Washington and have a bill that would help ↓ Rx costs by tackling an anti-competitive loophole. But there’s still much more to do.  https://t.co/KAWdTe95KIThis is wrong, and Minnesota families are fed up. Last weekend at the State Capitol, folks rallied to call for lower insulin prices in response to Alec’s death. https://t.co/Ff1xocCJzVThe amount of $$$ that Minnesotans are paying for their medications is unsustainable—and it’s costing lives. In Minnesota, we lost a young man named Alec because he couldn’t afford insulin to treat his diabetes. https://t.co/5V4fosfanKHere’s what I had to say in a hearing today on health care—which is something that I’ve said many times since I got to the Senate: too many families can’t afford the high price of their Rx drugs. https://t.co/CSX7Z5wyOXThanks to those who traveled to Washington with @alsassociation to discuss how we can help people affected by ALS and support research toward finding a cure. https://t.co/AhVof2BBXoIn my previous job, I traveled across the state to meet with Minnesotans. That’s still a big part of what I do now, but now I get to meet with them in Washington too. https://t.co/HDg4ZccU2qAs a member of the Senate Education Committee, I’m working to protect our students because that’s exactly who I should be fighting for, rather than for-profit schools.I stand with students. The Department of Education should too, but this seems like quite the opposite. https://t.co/3zGxyBbMkPThank you, @HennepinTech, for the opportunity to help celebrate your graduating class of intelligent, compassionate, and inspiring students. Congratulations, and good luck, Class of 2018! https://t.co/lHQwMPOLF4Minnesotans get it: clean energy can help save $$$ at the gas pump, and help cut greenhouse gas emissions. Would love to take a ride on one of @DuluthTransit’s new electric buses the next time I’m there! https://t.co/35XjYnvKrkMinnesota’s small businesses create jobs, drive innovation, and make significant contributions to our economy. Congratulations to all of @SBAgov’s MN 2018 Small Business Winners, including Brenda Nolby, Small Business Person of The Year. https://t.co/Iy3uNwazNWI firmly believe that Gina Haspel should not lead the CIA with this dark part of our history on her record, and I will be voting against her nomination for director of the CIA. https://t.co/aARW7lMFnlWith the vote on Gina Haspel’s nomination, we should speak clearly that we oppose torture, that the excesses of the detention &amp; interrogation program do not reflect our values, &amp; we will never allow this brutal activity to be the law or the practice of our country.Gina Haspel’s record of having been involved in America’s torture program—and involved in the destruction of tapes that provided evidence of this dark period—demonstrates profoundly troubling judgment.Last week I joined anti-torture groups (including @cvt_staff, which is headquartered in MN), faith leaders, and fellow members of Congress to outline why Gina Haspel should not lead the CIA. https://t.co/deJVsLcbz2 https://t.co/zOehJiNDdSWe can work on behalf of moms in MN &amp; across the country by continuing to fight for them. Let’s keep advocating for equal pay for women, and paid family leave so moms aren’t forced to go without a paycheck when they take time off for a new kid or a sick family member. #MothersDayRural communities face unique challenges when it comes to accessing quality health care, but it also means that ppl have to come up with some pretty innovative ways to address them. Was glad to join fellow leader of the Senate Rural Health Caucus @SenatorHeitkamp in Breckenridge. https://t.co/N3iErtLgjuThanks to all who joined me and @SenatorHeitkamp in Fargo today to share how you’re affected by the multiemployer pension crisis. We’ll take your stories back to Washington, and workers, retirees, and businesses can also send suggestions and ideas to JSCSMPP@finance.senate.gov. https://t.co/jZdsvSkhDVI fought for a seat on a bipartisan Senate panel w/ @SenatorHeitkamp committed to finding solutions bc there are 22,000+ Minnesotans—&amp; thousands more in North Dakota—whose retirement will be at risk if Central States Pension Fund &amp; other similar pension plans are allowed to fail.There are Minnesotans and North Dakotans who have worked years and who were counting on the pension funds they paid into being there for them in their retirement. Is pulling the rug out from under them the message we want to send to our kids and grandkids? https://t.co/21WfFDtg8GI heard from a man in Fargo today during a pensions meeting with @SenatorHeitkamp who went back to work in the oil fields at age 73 because he couldn’t rely on his full pension being there for him. Imagine being that man and having to explain that to your grandkids. https://t.co/MdPIPWRGgTWe need him to deliver on the promises he made to families across the nation, namely allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and to take action now. My full statement on President Trump's address focused on prescription drug prices: https://t.co/qki8C2T41NSo while I’m glad that President Trump supports a commonsense measure to cut drug costs, he needs to do much more. The President’s plan doesn’t do enough to hold drug companies accountable and falls short of all that’s needed to provide needed relief to Minnesota families.Today, the President said we need to bring down prescription drug prices and address "pay-for-delay"—the Big Pharma tactic that keeps affordable generic drugs out of the hands of Americans—and that’s exactly what the first bill I introduced in the Senate aims to do.“Commencement” is a funny word. In the graduation context, it represents the long-awaited last step in a long journey. But the word “commencement” also means “beginning.” And the question is: The beginning of what? My full speech to @HennepinTech here: https://t.co/sN1VghfIUDClass of 2018 at @HennepinTech—I’m honored to be your commencement speaker. Congratulations—no matter what path you took to graduation, and no matter where your journey takes you from here, today is a day to celebrate. Livestream: https://t.co/zwoqB464chMN is where I raised my kids &amp; where I started my own business. It's where I realized I wanted a job focused on talking to people about their lives, listening, &amp; then going to work to make things better. Happy Birthday, MN. Glad to call you home, &amp; you don't look a day over 130.From one woman who supports #netneutrality to another, thank you. https://t.co/eGMEPrFWwv#TBT to one of our first photos as a family of 4! Archie and I may look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed but it’s probably just a facade—a newborn baby means little sleep. Raising our family in Minnesota was the best decision we could’ve made. https://t.co/OajrpIDfABA new #FarmBill is right around the corner, and I want to gather input from as many farmers, ranchers, and ag businesses as I can. Thanks to the Minnesotans who shared their priorities with my team in Cloquet yesterday and Worthington today. https://t.co/xWadThNN7R https://t.co/l8agqGzJU4Glad to see the @FCC cracking down on these robocall and spoofing operations. I’m going to be looking at more options to take on these spam callers. https://t.co/3JiOhqc1UdLast month alone we had 3.4 BILLION robocalls in our country. It’s clear we need to be doing much more to make sure our laws are appropriately protecting consumers.You ever get spam calls from numbers that appear local—or even more confusing—look nearly identical to your own phone number? You’re not alone. This is called “neighbor spoofing” and it’s getting worse and worse.#ICYMI: The bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator @lisamurkowski to expand access to mental health services for young people is one step closer to becoming law. The House companion was introduced this week. Great to see my colleagues supporting this commonsense measure. https://t.co/oiqKJg0ynkI want to do everything I can to support MN farmers, especially given the tough farm economy that’s taken a toll on too many. That’s why I’m backing the bipartisan Hemp Farming Act, which would create new opportunity for our farmers by allowing them to grow &amp; sell a new product.These visits helped me write a bill that reflects both the needs of and successes pioneered by Minnesota, and I’m going to push to get this commonsense bill passed into law. https://t.co/EIS5cTJXlUOver the past few months, I’ve been traveling all around MN to gather input on local workforce needs. I’ve seen models that excel, visited communities that have found success, and I’ve seen places that could benefit from more resources and support. https://t.co/joXMlGOHZAMy bill, called the 21st Century Workforce Partnerships Act, would expand workforce training partnerships between secondary schools, community and technical colleges, and local businesses. It’s an idea that works.Not everyone wants or needs to go to a four-year college. But everyone should be able to find a good-paying career. That’s why I introduced a bill to help Minnesotans develop the skills they need for jobs that are available right now—without taking on huge amounts of debt.Her story is just one example of the many ways #NetNeutrality helps advance our state. We’re getting closer to the vote to protect net neutrality, and we’re not backing down. Join me in this fight. Make your voices heard before it’s too late. https://t.co/rAGme3OI7V#NetNeutrality puts her small business on a level-playing field with big businesses all across the country. She told me that without it they’d be wiped out. She'd have no chance of competing.It allows the internet to be a pillar of innovation that powers Minnesota's modern economy. Just last week I met a Minnesota woman who told me how important #NetNeutrality is to running small business. https://t.co/Nr8O5gwyI5#NetNeutrality means that some big corporation doesn't get to decide what we see online, how fast we get to see it, based on how much you’re willing to pay.The Senate is in the homestretch of the fight to save #NetNeutrality. Today I joined my Democratic Senate colleagues in filing a petition to force a vote to restore #NetNeutrality protections.Today I’m joining The Center For Victims of Torture (@cvt_staff)—an anti-torture group headquarted in Minnesota—to say why Gina Haspel should not lead the CIA. Watch live: https://t.co/deJVsLcbz2Thanks to the parents, child care providers, and advocates who shared their ideas with my team in Bemidji yesterday. https://t.co/yBBJFFzFPLI’m traveling across Minnesota to gather input on how we can tackle this problem. And when I’m in Washington, I’ve asked my staff in the state to continue this outreach.There’s a growing child care shortage in Minnesota. I’ve talked to families in greater Minnesota who have to drive 50 miles—50 miles!—to drop off their kids. That’s ridiculous. Minnesota families need affordable, quality child care that’s close to home.Some people play basketball, some people coach basketball. But both at the same time? Incredible. Happy Birthday @Lindsay_13, head coach of @GophersWBB team and point guard for the @MinnesotaLynx. Can’t wait to watch you play this Saturday! 
https://t.co/yIiaqRQmtXPresident Trump was wrong to pull out of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/WzegNMWz3bSo @SecretaryCarson, I’m hoping you’ll reconsider your plan and instead work to improve access to affordable, stable housing. That’s what’s best for Minnesotans and best for the country. https://t.co/SguUwsR0uf.@SecretaryCarson: you should scrap your proposal to impose new restrictions on housing subsidies. Low-income Minnesotans sometimes need help making ends meet to pay for housing—including seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and children. I’m glad you agree, @duluthnews. https://t.co/rWEF9XEnemIn fact the entire island lost power during a recent visit by our Minnesota Twins. That’s unreal. So today I told a top Department of Energy official that Americans in Puerto Rico deserve better, and they deserve it now. Take a look: https://t.co/fj09ic9KEQThese are U.S. citizens we’re talking about. And what we wouldn’t accept for MNs, we shouldn’t accept for Puerto Ricans. While many Puerto Ricans have finally had their electricity restored, the grid remains fragile and has been hit by wide-scale power outages in recent months.Would families and communities still be dealing with severe power outages, unstable living conditions, and widespread blackouts nine months after having their lives upended? I doubt it.When I think about what we saw happen in Puerto Rico with Hurricane Maria, I can’t help but think what the response would look like if a comparable disaster struck Minnesota.I’m so grateful for these teachers, and for all teachers across Minnesota who are shaping our students into curious, compassionate, and smart leaders. So today—on #TeacherAppreciationDay—I want to say thank you. #ThankATeacher https://t.co/y8HwfYEyllAnd in high school my chemistry teacher didn’t give up on me when I struggled to grasp the material. I knew that he believed in my potential, so when it was time to apply for college, I asked him to write my letter of recommendation.Ms. Larkin, my first grade teacher, taught me how much fun learning can be. She taught me about style, too: she drove a robin’s egg blue Volkswagen bug. In junior high I had an English teacher who taught me that reading is a great adventure. I still believe this to be true.Here’s a photo from junior high. Growing up I was lucky to have some great teachers who made a real impact on my life, and who I still remember to this day. https://t.co/CdCvAcXnhdIn the US, we do our best to bring our fallen service members home. I’m glad that we can recognize and honor Quentin Gifford of Mankato—a WWII sailor killed at Pearl Harbor whose remains were recently identified—and welcome him back to Minnesota. https://t.co/Li0q9gIjCaThat’s why I introduced a bipartisan bill to improve public health preparedness by recognizing the connection between human, environmental, and animal health. https://t.co/NZ3KjDkFBrA “One Health” approach—the idea that human health is connected to the health of the environment and animals—can help us prevent and respond to pressing health issues, like the worsening allergy season that is affecting many Minnesotans right now. https://t.co/qeksoYih0hI want to help more folks have opportunities like this. That's why I intro'd a legislative roadmap for the energy section of the #FarmBill, which would help MNs develop energy efficient and renewable energy projects by strengthening what works for our farm communities—incl. REAP. https://t.co/nJb3qtdj8lI’m thrilled that Minnesota farmers in Carver and Pope counties have been awarded REAP funding to lower energy costs and boost renewable energy on their farms.When we can help Minnesota farmers, producers, ag businesses and rural areas invest in renewable energy, cut costs, and create jobs—that’s a win. And that’s exactly what the @USDA Rural Energy for America Program (#REAP) does.And thank you, @2harvest, for your commitment to helping Minnesota families have enough to eat. Your work is critical to supporting the well-being of thousands of Minnesotans, and I’m going to fight to protect programs that help prevent hunger in the upcoming #FarmBill debate. https://t.co/Fld0sE5GjUT-minus two days till @SenateDems file a petition to force a vote on restoring #NetNeutrality protections. And guess what: we’re one Senator away from winning that vote. My colleagues @AmyKlobuchar &amp; @SenMarkey are ready to #SaveTheInternet. Are you? https://t.co/OIdAuTSydhCongratulations to the 2018 Minnesota Teacher of the Year—Kelly Holstine—an English teacher at Tokata Learning Center. I love Kelly’s motto: “every kid matters”. Thanks, Kelly, for providing your students with a high quality education, and for inspiring others to do the same. https://t.co/OGOIMz2wj9This bill would strengthen programs that have already seen success, like the Beginning Farmer &amp; Rancher Development Program, &amp; encourage the development of technology that makes it easier for more farmers &amp; ranchers to bring their products to market. https://t.co/rhFZ1eNVHPFarming is a way of life for many MN families, &amp; as a member of @SenateAgDems I want to help our next generation of farmers &amp; ranchers, like Abe &amp; Cally, succeed. I’m backing a bipartisan bill to support new and beginning farmers and ranchers enter and remain in the ag industry.Meet Abe and Cally Jergenson: two young farmers who grew up on farms in western Minnesota and decided to start their own family farm in Lake Minnewaska in 2014. https://t.co/mEWj4uRPgHFeel like your allergies are worse this spring? Yeah...you're not wrong. Climate change isn't just an environmental issue, it's a public health issue that's affecting allergies and asthma. https://t.co/aua8OvGh24Thanks to those who met with me, &amp; for standing up for families in need. W/o your help, food security for MNs could be in jeopardy. Know that I’ll be a fierce advocate for nutrition programs as we move into #FarmBill debate bc that’s what families deserve. https://t.co/hlWqq4vuZII met with SNAP participants, food bank &amp; food shelf leaders, &amp; experts on health &amp; nutrition to discuss the effect of these proposed cuts. Under the President’s budget plan, MN would need to secure an additional $150 million just to maintain our current nutrition needs. https://t.co/pnJoxGDoCRI’m very disappointed that the President wants to make deep cuts toprograms like SNAP, which support millions of Americans below or close to the poverty line—most of whom work for low wages, are elderly or disabled, or care for young children.Last year, Minnesotans made an estimated three million visits to local food shelves, and we know that many families in our state still lack access to nutritious and healthy meals. In fact, in Minnesota, one-in-ten households struggle with hunger. https://t.co/HP3DaBUb9ZWhat if you found out that you were at risk of no longer being able to put food on the table for your family? When I think about getting news like that, I know I’d be scared, and I’d be frustrated.Thanks to everyone who shared their input with me today, and know that I'm going to fight for nutrition programs when we start working on the #FarmBill in the Senate. https://t.co/oprSkqjbYbFood security is important. When Minnesotans have enough to eat, our communities are stronger. Families are healthier, folks can go to work, and kids do better in school. https://t.co/X8uvRD0PkjToday at @2harvest I met w/ #SNAP participants, food bank and food shelf leaders, and experts on health and nutrition to discuss the impact of proposed funding cuts to #FarmBill nutrition programs. There’s clear consensus that these programs are critical to fighting hunger in MN. https://t.co/TB7jBZVkM4On some reservations, Native women are murdered at a rate of 10 times the national average. This is horrific &amp; completely unacceptable. Today—on Nat’l Day of Awareness for Missing &amp; Murdered Indigenous Women &amp; Girls—we recommit ourselves to fighting this violence. #NotInvisibleIf you have any questions about my Veterans Listening Tour, or if you’re a Minnesota veteran who needs help accessing benefits, feel free to call my St. Paul office at (651) 221-1016. I want to help as many folks as possible.I want to make sure veterans across the state know that they can reach out to me when they hit roadblocks in accessing the benefits they earned. I recently dispatched my team to meet w/ folks in Aitkin, Detroit Lakes, &amp; Fergus Falls to discuss VA health care, housing, &amp; jobs. https://t.co/2MhxCrymXNI’m horrified and heartbroken by this senseless act. An attack on any member our community is an attack on all of us. We need to bring about real change to prevent tragedies like this from repeating. https://t.co/kxWntb3E0FOn Wednesday there was a devastating act of violence in our community. While we’re still learning details of what happened, we know that two suspects opened fire outside Minneapolis' Little Earth housing complex. https://t.co/vNpyWkjvg3Her story is inspiring, but it is not unique. It’s one example of the many ways in which Minnesota's immigrant communities contribute to our state. Their story is not theirs alone—it is the story of our nation, and it is the story of our state.This ceremony was especially meaningful to me because a member of my staff was among them. I’m so proud of Saran, whose own life experiences have led her to work toward a peaceful and more just society. This fall she will begin studying conflict resolution at Harvard. https://t.co/gaAkvI4ZlEIt was a honor to help recognize 40 people who became American citizens today at a naturalization ceremony in St. Paul. Ours is a state of immigrants—from the Scandinavians who made MN their home so many years ago to the Hmong &amp; Somali families who came here more recently. https://t.co/qYt4GSc27TThe CREAATE Act would help provide our country’s ag community with new export opportunities and create jobs, and I’m going to fight to see it through.MAP and FMDP have displayed a return of $28.30 for every dollar invested between 1977 and 2014. Despite these successes, MAP and FDMP funding has not increased since the 2002 Farm Bill, even as competitors increase their efforts.That’s why I’m backing the CREAATE Act, which would help expand foreign markets for #mnag by strengthening already successful @USDA export programs, like the Market Access Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP)I’m traveling across MN to learn about ag priorities bc I want to advocate for our farmers, ranchers &amp; agribusinesses. I recently hosted #FarmBill mtgs in Austin, Granite Falls, Hutchinson, Lake Crystal, Melrose, Morris &amp; Wabasha. And one issue that came up was access to markets.#TBT to enjoying a warm spring day with our sons, Sam and Mason, who look like they are ready to leap back into the game. They’re now grown men (amazingly, I’m still the same age!); I remember this like it was yesterday. https://t.co/egXw2skNLII can’t wait to take the ideas I got from passionate Minnesotans back with me to Washington D.C. to continue Minnesota’s legacy as a leader in mental health care.Today I met w/ parents, community leaders, mental health advocates, &amp; school mental health providers at Washington Technology Magnet High School (@washingtontech) in St. Paul to hear how we can increase early intervention of mental health issues to support MN children &amp; families. https://t.co/AmXNR6EOTRThat’s why I’m working to expand access to mental health services for young people. I’ve introduced a bipartisan bill to help communities across the country bolster their mental health treatment options for children—but that’s just the start.Kids struggle with mental health every bit as much as adults, but young people frequently have a hard time accessing mental health care.I firmly believe that @SecretaryCarson should reconsider this proposal and instead work to improve access to affordable, stable housing for low-income people. https://t.co/h266QPifHRIf enacted, this proposal would leave even more low income people without stable homes, including seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and children. It would affect 72,400 households in Minnesota, and 4.1 million households nationally.I’m urging Secretary of Housing and Urban Development @SecretaryCarson to scrap his proposal to raise rents by imposing new strict requirements on households across the country. https://t.co/1vFZYojcYkThis bill took an important step towards becoming law after passing out of the Senate Health Committee, and I’m going to urge my colleagues to support this bill in the coming weeks. https://t.co/DVrJZsI314I’m proud of what these students have accomplished. Part of helping students succeed means providing greater access to mental health services. That's why I recently intro'd a bipartisan bill w/ @lisamurkowski to expand access to mental health services in schools &amp; communities. https://t.co/6nzrchZjesWhile I wasn’t able to be there in person, I’m glad I got to virtually connect with the impressive students at REACH’s conference in Hutchinson. REACH is a program in 30+ schools that helps provide students with the support they need to attain academic and personal success. https://t.co/lWNtMffCgHBeing a fierce advocate for Minnesotans is my top priority. That’s why my office is traveling across the state to explain how I can help Minnesotans cut through red tape when they need help with a federal agency.College graduates in MN leave school with an average of approx. 31k in debt. The student debt crisis is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. My office met with @mnprivcolleges to discuss how we can improve college affordability and increase access to higher education. https://t.co/egomnMkKqVMeet Quinn, a 7th grade student from @112CMSE and a #NetNeutrality advocate. Thanks for attending last week’s discussion on the importance of protecting a free and open internet, and for sharing your Net Neutrality school project with me. https://t.co/NFFHmC4gJQSupporting our family farmers and ranchers, who make great contributions to our economy and help feed the country, shouldn’t be partisan, and I’m going to be fighting to get this bill signed into law. https://t.co/92uCN5BtgBThat’s why I’m backing @SenatorHeitkamp and @SenatorCollins’ bipartisan bill to support new and beginning farmers and ranchers enter and remain in the ag industry. https://t.co/pJFwMvsbPqThe average age of a farmer in Minnesota is 56. As our farming workforce continues to age and we look to the future, it’s important that we help build the next generation of farmers, ranchers, and ag businesses.
