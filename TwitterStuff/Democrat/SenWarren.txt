At the #FamiliesBelongTogether march tomorrow, we’ll show @realDonaldTrump that the real power is with the people. I’ll be rallying in Boston. Will you join us? #TogetherAndFree https://t.co/k1r0jPYRnSTomorrow, thousands of Puerto Rican evacuees will lose federal housing assistance &amp; many will be left homeless. @FEMA refuses to set up the longer-term disaster housing program used after Katrina &amp; Sandy. And the GOP is blocking legislation that would do it. This is shameful. https://t.co/AV4U2i5BV1Great news: Massachusetts is moving closer to a level playing field for working families. Congratulations to @RaiseUPMA and the thousands of workers, organizers, and volunteers who have fought their hearts out for an MA economy that works for everyone! https://t.co/x0i12XTHXaMy heart goes out to the Capital Gazette. No journalist should have to duck bullets in the newsroom. No student should have to hide from an active shooter. No one should have to live in fear of being in the middle of the next mass shooting. This violence MUST end..@nationalgridus got a huge windfall from the #GOPtaxscam – but the gas company is still squeezing its own employees. 1,100 union workers who were negotiating for better wages &amp; health care coverage have been locked out of their jobs. @steelworkers, we’re with you in this fight. https://t.co/d00Gb8I06bThe fight for equal justice for ALL Americans – not just the rich and powerful – has only just begun. Watch live: https://t.co/nmuyzd5gjQMitch McConnell should follow the Mitch McConnell rule. Let the American people have a say when women’s health and equal rights are on the line.Corporate interests have been rigging the system against workers for decades – and the Supreme Court just handed those interests a huge victory in #Janus v. AFSCME. But I’ve got news for the billionaires behind this case: we’re not going anywhere. #Union https://t.co/LAxpB1k3iYI went down to the border protection processing center in McAllen, Texas so I could see what’s happening there with my own eyes. They wouldn’t let cameras inside, but I can tell you what I saw: https://t.co/JDqgTw4Z2JThe Supreme Court – thanks to a seat stolen by right-wing Republicans – just upheld Trump’s Muslim ban. While the Court ruled it’s legal, the American people still know it isn’t right. And together, we'll keep fighting against religious discrimination, xenophobia, &amp; hate. (2/2)Last year, I joined hundreds of people at Logan Airport to protest @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban. We believed that the courts would ultimately overturn it – because it didn’t make us any safer, and it clearly violated America’s core values. We were wrong. (1/2) https://t.co/E0NigZxuncI believe that when a woman flees the only home she's ever known with her 4-year-old son and begs the United States of America for asylum, she deserves a fair hearing. I believe that every human being has worth. We must do better.I spoke with one woman from El Salvador at a CBP processing center. She  gave a policeman a drink of water, and the gangs came after her. She sold everything she had and fled with her 4-year-old son because their lives were in danger.Today, I'm in McAllen, TX. What I've witnessed here is truly disturbing. People are being held in cages – there's no other way to describe it. There are children by themselves. Mothers with young babies. They have nothing but the clothes on their backs https://t.co/1VuVdLa42TBy outlawing marijuana, the federal government puts communities of color, small businesses, and public health and safety at risk. I talked with @Chris_topher_Mc of @WBSM1420 about my bipartisan bill to end the federal ban on marijuana. https://t.co/nxKTDsEdbcPowerful corporations and their Republican allies are working overtime to roll back basic rules that protect working Americans. Why? The answer’s pretty simple. It's the culture of corruption in Washington. https://t.co/vb31LaLlkuIt's been 6 months since Trump signed the #GOPtaxscam into law. I spoke with @KellerAtLarge about how it's hurting working families – and why we need a government that works for everyone, not just billionaires and big corporations. https://t.co/h7S3c0x9kpUPDATE: @BetsyDeVosED has lost another round in federal court. A judge just ruled that she cannot collect loans from students defrauded by Corinthian College, a predatory for-profit. This is a big win for students who have been scammed. https://t.co/vDuQmZ4JQZ https://t.co/eb68UV8ttPIf you agree that Thomas Farr – who has defended discrimination &amp; worked to restrict the voting rights of African Americans – has no place as a federal judge, now’s the time to say it loud and clear. @SenateMajLdr McConnell wants to ram through his confirmation in the Senate. https://t.co/zHjyFINpdUThis isn’t over. Thousands of kids have been ripped from their parents with no plan to reunite them. And now @realdonaldtrump wants to create new detention camps for families. Separating kids is unacceptable – but indefinite imprisonment of families is still cruel &amp; inhumane.On #WorldRefugeeDay, we cannot ignore the humanitarian crisis happening on our border as desperate families flee violence &amp; persecution. We should treat those seeking refuge with fairness &amp; compassion. We should be helping to solve the global refugee crisis – not making it worse..@RepCummings has devoted his life to the fight for justice. Watch as he makes a powerful case for why #FamiliesBelongTogether: https://t.co/CFY54EnnrM@realDonaldTrump is meeting with House Republicans to discuss his immigration crisis. Will they have the courage to stand against his family separation policy? https://t.co/ikQkAy6Kb1Kathy Kraninger helps oversee the agencies that are ripping kids from their parents. Now @realDonaldTrump wants her to run the @CFPB. I will put a hold on her nomination – &amp; fight it at every step – until she turns over all documents about her role in this.#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/wrW7oXP3Eo.@realDonaldTrump’s nominee to run the @CFPB, Kathy Kraninger, has no track record of helping consumers. That's bad news for seniors, servicemembers, students – and anyone else who doesn't want to get cheated. And it gets even worse..@realdonaldtrump could pick up the phone and stop the separation of families seeking refuge in the US. Instead, he continues to hold thousands of kids hostage to try and get Congress to pay for his stupid wall. This is his policy, and he can stop it. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pDw4eoFK8nKids across the US are spending today with their dads. But thousands of children who have been separated from their parents by the Trump Admin don’t have that option. Make this a #FathersDayOfAction &amp; join our fight to reunite these families. Ask your senators to support S.3036. https://t.co/wL9tDkJJ2HThousands of Americans have joined @UniteThePoor to call on our government to pay attention: to flat wages and rising rents, to undrinkable water, to families who struggle to put food on the table. @RepRoKhanna and I are listening, and we're in this fight all the way. https://t.co/j2aqC1hF7aJoseph Otting told Congress he’s never seen discrimination – even though he used to run a bank that went out of its way not to serve black and Latino families.  Now he's in charge of rewriting bank anti-discrimination rules. Absurd. #OCCnoColor https://t.co/ivRNp3B03yMy colleague @RepJayapal is right. We are not talking about immigration policy. We are talking about the soul of America. That is what’s at stake. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/5M3P0YY3arI’m going to fight like hell with @SenatorDurbin and the @SenateDems to end this cruel Trump Administration policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/XBCKxmwecjThe official policy of this administration is to rip children from their parents. Let that sink in. And then fight back. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/aq62ZZMVfaChildren are being separated from their parents and incarcerated. It’s not enough to be outraged. Make your voice heard and help us put a stop to this. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/MDKFrWvPo3We don't know how many Puerto Ricans died from Hurricane Maria, but we do know the official death toll of 64 is a huge undercount. The federal government hasn't done enough to assist or force accountability. I led 21 colleagues in demanding answers. https://t.co/lxYweTcN3qThe Trump Admin is packing our courts with right-wing nominees like Chad Readler who want to tilt the scales in favor of the rich &amp; powerful &amp; against everyone else. Anyone who cares about protecting the rights of all Americans should be in the fight for fair, impartial nominees. https://t.co/5JUsxtvG8XSome state governments are punishing people struggling with student loans by taking away their drivers’ &amp; professional licenses. This is wrong. @marcorubio &amp; I have a new bill to ensure borrowers can keep working to pay off their debt &amp; build a future. https://t.co/bijHVN6eMHPower is more and more concentrated in a handful of giant companies at the expense of small businesses, entrepreneurs, and working families. The @TheJusticeDept should appeal the court decision allowing the merger of @ATT and @twxcorp. https://t.co/KF7hnpbv9KThousands of children have been torn from their parents’ arms because of @realdonaldtrump’s cruel immigration policies – and now he wants to put them in prison camps. Their only “crime”? Seeking refuge here in the US. This is immoral. This is un-American. This is not who we are. https://t.co/AcMFv8a290Congress is voting on a reckless provision jammed into this year’s defense bill that would give @realdonaldtrump free rein to develop new nuclear weapons without congressional approval. @SenJackReed, @SenateDems and I are fighting hard to remove it. https://t.co/bR74BvDTE3.@SecAzar told the Senate about his shiny new drug pricing plan yesterday. But he can’t guarantee it won't raise prices for seniors on Medicare. And those "massive" price cuts Trump promised? Nowhere to be seen. Our seniors deserve real action to bring down high drug prices. https://t.co/cD4i4SCxy2Poor &amp; marginalized Americans are coming together across the country to demand a government that works for the people. Tune in live as @RepCummings and I welcome @UniteThePoor to the Capitol for a powerfully important conversation on poverty in America: https://t.co/LDiFyH6lZvMy full statement on President Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong Un: https://t.co/BgyTMzhI4q https://t.co/Dk1LNOnMuMJeff Sessions' move to deny asylum to women fleeing domestic violence does not reflect our country's true values. These strong, brave women come to America in search of safety and freedom. We should welcome them with compassion – not slam the door in their faces. https://t.co/geSBGJGPIuRed &amp; blue states alike have taken their own thoughtful approaches to marijuana. Now, 12 governors – led by @MassGovernor Baker – have endorsed my bipartisan bill to end the confusion between states &amp; the federal gov't, &amp; fix our broken marijuana policy. https://t.co/LCFmASiUXIOur democracy is under attack – but not lost. Watch live as I talk with the @ACLU about how we’re fighting to save it: https://t.co/CCFrDn25EWThe Supreme Court’s decision to make it easier for Ohio to cross eligible voters off the rolls is a major step backwards for our democracy. Americans should demand that Congress – and the courts – protect the voting rights of all citizens. https://t.co/O67CmMGVC5By outlawing marijuana, the federal government puts communities of color, small businesses, public health &amp; safety at risk. @SenCoryGardner and I have a new bill to end the federal ban on marijuana, and let states take their own approaches: https://t.co/kZVwmyws8PWhen I questioned Trump's pick to be the head of civil rights at @usedgov, he dipped &amp; dodged on whether he'd protect our kids from discrimination. But Senate Republicans still voted to confirm him, so he can join @BetsyDeVosED's efforts to undermine students' civil rights. https://t.co/haKtnbWiIIYesterday I met with Puerto Rican families who evacuated to MA after Hurricane Maria. They want to make MA their home, but are struggling to find long-term housing. @FEMA &amp; the Trump Admin have abandoned them – but @SenMarkey &amp; I will keep fighting for our fellow US citizens. https://t.co/dCE3CCN2t7A majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana. It’s time for Congress to listen, and pass this new bipartisan legislation. 
https://t.co/sljqUoMlCNThere's a lot we can do to address America’s broken marijuana policies – like passing @SenBooker’s #MarijuanaJusticeAct to end the federal ban on marijuana &amp; retroactively fix some of the harms caused by it. My new bipartisan bill is another key step to update our marijuana laws.No qualified scientist should have to struggle to conduct basic research on marijuana. Their findings could spur medical advances or counter the opioid epidemic. I'm introducing a new bill with @SenCoryGardner that could make it easier to study marijuana’s medical uses.No legitimate business should be blocked from basic banking services – but that’s exactly what’s happening to law-abiding marijuana businesses. My new bipartisan bill will help decrease the public safety risk that arises when these businesses are forced to operate in all-cash.No veteran with chronic pain, child with a rare disease, or person struggling with a terminal illness should be denied the treatment they need. Millions of Americans currently access medical marijuana under state law. My new bill with @SenCoryGardner will help protect them.No one should go to jail for a joint. But more Americans are arrested for marijuana possession than all violent crimes combined. And black Americans are nearly 4x more likely to be arrested for it than whites. My new bill will help put an end to this two-tiered justice system.By outlawing marijuana, the federal government puts communities of color, small businesses, &amp; public health &amp; safety at risk. My new bill with @SenCoryGardner will let states, territories, &amp; tribes decide for themselves how to regulate marijuana – without federal interference.The federal government’s marijuana policies are broken, outdated, and disregard the rights of states like MA &amp; CO that have taken their own thoughtful approaches. @SenCoryGardner and I are introducing new legislation to protect them. https://t.co/ojciYHEbqrIt’s time to reform American’s outdated marijuana policies. Watch live as @SenCoryGarder and I discuss our new legislation that would let states, territories, &amp; tribes decide for themselves how best to regulate marijuana – without federal interference.  https://t.co/BVcvxomhld.@MickMulvaneyOMB has no intention of putting consumers above financial  firms that cheat them. This is what happens when you put someone in charge of an agency they think shouldn’t exist. https://t.co/1Vs4xNE2itRobert Kennedy understood that we cannot simply run our economy for those at the top and assume that it will solve America’s problems. After his death, America tried that experiment anyway, and failed miserably. It's time to try something different. https://t.co/1JFNHADENPCorruption oozes out of @EPAScottPruitt’s office like toxic sludge – and working families will get burned by it. I spoke today about why we must clean up the corporate money sloshing around DC, and ensure our government represents real people – not Pruitt’s Big Coal buddies. https://t.co/j6EUHlMRyfThe GOP wants you to believe that their war on regulations is about freedom. Baloney. Good rules empower people to live, work, and do business freely and safely. Tune in live as I speak about how strong, clear rules protect the freedom of all Americans. https://t.co/isfjBXBTSL.@realDonaldTrump is playing a political game, and he believes he gets to make up the rules. He doesn’t. The Constitution is clear – even the President of the United States is not above the law. Special Counsel Mueller must continue his investigation without interference. https://t.co/V3WwH0K9GuLa respuesta del gobierno federal en Puerto Rico después del huracán María ha sido pésima. Hablé con @TelemundoNI sobre un nuevo proyecto de ley que tengo con el @SenMarkey para finalmente ayudar a los sobrevivientes que han venido a Massachusetts a encontrar nuevos hogares. https://t.co/Osd57nZtGe.@SenMarkey &amp; I are introducing a bill to make @FEMA address the medium &amp; long-term housing needs of survivors of Hurricane Maria &amp; future natural disasters. Families are at risk of homelessness &amp; a new hurricane season is about to begin – this can’t wait. https://t.co/sak0XiFudwLet’s be clear: @realDonaldTrump's gag rule isn't about improving women’s health care. It's an attempt to control women and shut down Title X providers that offer critical reproductive care. It’s right-wing ideology disguised as health policy. https://t.co/eHi45WAoMDCar dealers are exempt from @CFPB oversight – and auto loan defaults just hit a 15-year high. That's not a coincidence. It's what happens when shady lending practices go unchecked. https://t.co/83jrJdauyFEven as banks make record profits, their former banker buddies turned regulators are doing them favors by rolling back a rule that protects taxpayers from another bailout. This kind of corruption is common in @realDonaldTrump’s Washington. https://t.co/jECa7oWhJTThousands of students were cheated by for-profit colleges, but @BetsyDeVosED wants to stop students from getting the full loan forgiveness they deserve. So, I called for an investigation. Now a federal judge has agreed with me &amp; stopped her illegal scheme. https://t.co/8PWmtFXzjV.@Walmart rakes in billions from the #GOPTaxScam and sends the profits straight to Wall Street, while many employees struggle to put food on the dinner table. These share buybacks are a perfect example of how our economy is rigged against working families. https://t.co/A9H8Adtzv0In another example of weak enforcement that will harm our economy, the DOJ just approved the @Bayer-@MonsantoCo merger, placing enormous power in the hands of one agribusiness giant. This deal is a brutal blow to small &amp; family farmers, as well as our food supply. https://t.co/XFVYbvGrJkThe official death count in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is only 64. A new study shows the real total could be 70x that. For months, I've pushed for an accurate gov't count to learn the full extent of this tragedy. It's disgraceful we're still waiting. https://t.co/uDYGca05LG https://t.co/6nazdgPsy1All 3 of my brothers served &amp; came home safe. But many do not. I had the chance to honor a special group of veterans by dedicating a new POW/MIA Chair of Honor in the Capitol. It reminds us of those who haven't returned. On #MemorialDay, we remember &amp; honor their sacrifice. https://t.co/wMOa6QBr2gFirefighters face a higher rate of cancer than the rest of the population. They face enough risk every day – we’ve got to do our part to keep them safe. Here’s what I’m doing in the Senate to help. https://t.co/MsnCf5I3tyUpdate: Brian Montgomery has been confirmed by the Senate 74 to 23. In Donald Trump’s Washington, the revolving door spins faster and faster.The #BankLobbyistAct was just signed into law – rolling back rules on big banks. But bank lobbyists are already asking Congress for another round of favors. Washington won't stop this cycle until the American people demand it.https://t.co/eeSnK0ALNQPresident Trump’s wild back and forth with Kim Jong Un shows once again that he has no strategy. If @realdonaldtrump wants to demonstrate real leadership, he needs to develop a plan and commit to work towards a peaceful resolution with North Korea.I spoke with preachers from across the country about growing up a Methodist, teaching Sunday School to rowdy 5th graders, &amp; why I’m determined to fight for respect for the value of every person. Thank you, @FestHomiletics, for hosting – and for joining in these righteous fights. https://t.co/ksC3HijLgNI love when the USW comes to the Capitol. They’re loud, they’re strong, and they won’t back down from the fight. Corporate interests have captured a Supreme Court seat and continue to haunt the halls of Congress, but I stand with @steelworkers and unions all the way! https://t.co/Z7zKiRNaVwOver 700 children have been separated from their parents thanks to a new, cruel Trump Admin policy. Today, @SenateDems are calling on @realdonaldtrump &amp; @DHSgov to stop their attacks on asylum-seeking families. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/kLTpKkIKH9 https://t.co/BXepEHzxaHYesterday, I met with @AMarch4OurLives leaders @Alfonso_Cal, @davidhogg111, and @Charlie_Mirsky. Congress still hasn’t found the courage to act on gun violence – but these students continue to bravely lead the fight. I’m proud to stand with them. https://t.co/h5zhtpdfveWe should be expanding – not limiting – women’s access to reproductive health care. Instead, the GOP is attacking services that prevent unplanned pregnancies, women's access to STI &amp; cancer screenings, &amp; their right to make their own reproductive choices. https://t.co/oJo8ewgKvYBig banks have spent millions of dollars trying to roll back the rules we put in place after we bailed them out ten years ago. Today, they got what they paid for. The House just passed the #BankLobbyistAct. We lost this round – but we won't give up the fight. https://t.co/ppFj9SUm1MIn a decision written by Justice Gorsuch, the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations can block workers from suing together over major violations of their rights, like sexual harassment, discrimination, &amp; wage theft. Congress should act to reverse this terrible decision. https://t.co/k6742lLlhVFor years, armies of bank lobbyists &amp; executives have groaned about how financial rules are hurting them. But there's a big problem with their story – banks are making record profits. Congress has done enough favors for big banks – the House should reject the #BankLobbyistAct. https://t.co/x95rfTYBULThe #BankLobbyistAct rolls back the rules on big banks &amp; increases the risk of another taxpayer bailout. It could pass the House tomorrow. This is our last chance to stop this bill from becoming law. Washington has heard enough from the lobbyists – it's time they hear from you.I graduated from a commuter college like @Quinsig. Even as the rich and powerful tighten their hold on our democratic institutions – democracy is changing. And I’m hopeful because the Class of 2018 and young people everywhere are leading the change. 
https://t.co/8JF6Uql1FVToday I told the graduates of @lesley_u: There will be plenty of people in your life who will try to shut you up, but people who shut up seldom make a difference. #persist https://t.co/3WSeLyD7gXMy heart breaks for the students and faculty of Santa Fe High School, and the families of those who lost their lives today. One young person lost to gun violence is one too many. This cannot continue. #EnoughIsEnoughWe're going to keep fighting back against @realdonaldtrump, @VP Pence, and right-wing politicians who want to regulate women's bodies and shut down Planned Parenthood. Women's reproductive health care is health care. Period. #StandwithPP  https://t.co/kmLaPxRi4I.@realdonaldtrump's gag rule is designed to kick providers like Planned Parenthood out of Title X &amp; hold women hostage to the GOP's agenda. Title X patients won't be able to learn about all their reproductive options – worsening health care disparities &amp; reducing access to care.Title X provides birth control, cancer screenings &amp; HIV tests to over 4M Americans. It doesn’t fund abortions &amp; never has. But today, @realdonaldtrump will issue a “gag” rule that will stop Title X doctors from even talking to their patients about abortion-related services. https://t.co/3LFHjd4YliCreating fake accounts, cheating servicemembers, overcharging mortgage borrowers – and now altering documents to fake compliance with an anti-money laundering order. @WellsFargo needs to face some real consequences, and CEO Tim Sloan needs to be fired. https://t.co/73Vvf10Gp1No matter how you dress it up, torture is torture. It’s inhumane, ineffective, and un-American. Gina Haspel advocated for torture.

I’m glad she slowed down long enough for us to grab a photo. https://t.co/KSC7w62aMzThanks to my partner @SenMarkey for leading the charge in the Senate to save #NetNeutrality. We won this fight today because the American people made their voices heard – our colleagues in the House should listen. https://t.co/vJxkpozZNNDemocrats want to stop internet providers from blocking access, filtering content, or charging higher fees. I’m speaking on the Senate floor ahead of a big vote to save #NetNeutrality. Tune in live – while you still can: https://t.co/655MpjhIbJCEO salaries are soaring while wages for American workers are barely budging. At many companies, CEOs make more in 1 year than their employees could make in a lifetime. @keithellison’s new report is a powerful tool for workers, shareholders, and the public to demand fair pay. https://t.co/y9dr2FwTSi.@Equifax faced no real penalty after compromising the data of 148M Americans. Instead of demanding accountability, the @FTC is putting the company's hired gun in charge of the bureau that’s supposed to protect consumers. This is corruption, plain &amp; simple.https://t.co/kQyNsdcnHuThomas Farr, @realdonaldtrump's nominee for a federal judgeship, worked to undermine voting rights &amp; defended discrimination against women, African Americans, &amp; LGBTQ Americans. His record should disqualify him from sitting on the bench, &amp; the Senate should reject his nomination. https://t.co/ATDu3tOygOBoth @ATT and @Novartis had significant business before the Trump Admin when they secretly paid Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen hundreds of thousands of dollars. What did they expect in return? Was this pay-to-play? The American people deserve to know. https://t.co/BIdqseZ1MZ.@BetsyDeVosED has filled @usedgov with for-profit college hacks who only care about making sham schools rich and shutting down investigations into fraud. In the Trump Administration’s war on students, I stand with students. https://t.co/UlBmOpk2BGHey @PhilipsLight: You don’t get to walk away with millions in tax breaks and then turn around and spit in the face of your workers. We won’t stop fighting for Fall River. https://t.co/ufB4QwIYCbCarl knows what it will take to beat the opioid epidemic – because he’s been fighting the AIDS epidemic for years. We need to invest in research and treatment. We need money to go directly to the communities that need it. We need to pass the #CAREact. https://t.co/K7Yf4MpDVtI pushed the @federalreserve hard to hold a public vote on whether @WellsFargo should be allowed to get any bigger – and now they will. The Fed should strongly enforce the penalties it imposed to keep the bank from cheating people again. https://t.co/r11EASNnplWe owe our @USNationalGuard members the very best. But some officers are forced to wait months for their promotions to be recognized due to bureaucratic delays. My bipartisan bill with @SteveDaines takes simple steps to fix this &amp; do right by our Guard. https://t.co/0iKfVJ6dfvIt’s unacceptable that @Equifax has taken so long to tell the whole truth about the extent of the breach. @Equifax needs to be held accountable – and we need strong legislation to make sure credit reporting agencies don’t let this happen again. https://t.co/0GO59qiKpFA months-long investigation by my office revealed that @Equifax failed to disclose all the information that was taken in the #EquifaxBreach. The company tried to deny it – but now admits that thousands of Americans’ passport numbers were exposed. https://t.co/fDExGXRRC6I agree with @SenJohnMcCain.

They deserve our respect &amp; support. #ThankATeacher https://t.co/d38Xx3kFqVOur justice system is broken. Black and brown Americans receive harsher sentences than white Americans for the same crimes. @OfficialCBC, how can we work together to end racial bias in our justice system and ensure everyone is treated equally under the law? #CBCDemandsJusticeThe @OfficialCBC is hosting a Twitter town hall right now on our broken criminal justice system. This is a powerfully important conversation – I  hope you’ll join me in participating. #CBCDemandsJusticeEven the Trump Administration has conceded that Iran is complying with the deal. Now @realdonaldtrump has pulled out without offering any real alternative to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Creating chaos and confusion isn’t a strategy – it’s a recipe for disaster.The Obama Administration negotiated a landmark agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. @realDonaldTrump’s decision to withdraw from the deal breaks our word, hurts our credibility with our allies, empowers Iranian hardliners, and doesn’t make us any safer.Massachusetts has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country – and one of the lowest gun fatality rates as a result.

This is the real legacy of the @realdonaldtrump-GOP tax scam: American workers suffer so wealthy shareholders can get even richer. It's despicable. https://t.co/3KLZJ7EUDDInstead of buying back their own stock and outsourcing jobs, companies like @PhilipsLight should be investing in the workers and communities that made them so successful in the first place. https://t.co/yiMVwjwCFY.@PhilipsLight can afford to shell out $187 million to shareholders, so @RepJoeKennedy and I want to know why they’re planning to outsource nearly 200 jobs to Canada &amp; Mexico. One thing is clear: @realDonaldTrump’s #GOPtaxscam isn’t working for Fall River. https://t.co/LNZIpMwYzgDid you know it’s legal for companies to pay people with disabilities pennies on the dollar for doing the same job as a worker without a disability? It’s a discriminatory practice – and I'm working to eliminate it. https://t.co/KiFnq7OIS3The proposed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile could strangle competition in the telecom industry and end up hurting small businesses, entrepreneurs, and working families. @TheJusticeDept and FCC need to give this deal a long, hard look. 
https://t.co/cg3EImLNOoI agree with Sheriff @stevenwtompkins of Suffolk County – the opioid epidemic is out of control and our country needs to step up and get people the treatment they need. https://t.co/sW9swUzONEOver 20,000 consumers have filed complaints about @Equifax with the @CFPB since the #EquifaxBreach. But instead of working to help those people, @MickMulvaneyOMB wants to make it easier for big financial institutions to get away with cheating them. https://t.co/P4fYTMqKQ8Firefighters are exposed to harsh chemicals on the job, and develop cancer at higher rates as a result. I've been pushing for a bipartisan bill to create a national cancer registry to collect better data so we can help protect our firefighters. Thanks to @Boston25 for covering. https://t.co/YOXHMCpgTDLast month, corporate lobbyists found a single court willing to block @USDOL's conflict-of-interest rule, which was designed to stop shady advisers from cheating families out of billions every year. I'm glad that @AARP is sticking up for retirement savers.https://t.co/TMtM6u2or6I’d like @MickMulvaneyOMB to explain to the American people why almost every major decision he’s made at the @CFPB has benefited the lobbyists who donated thousands of dollars to his political campaigns.

https://t.co/1Zbg6qVPMsThe DOJ is on track to approve a merger between Monsanto and Bayer, which would hand control of 1/4 of the world’s seeds and pesticides to a single mega-giant company. This is a bad deal that would put the squeeze on struggling family farmers &amp; jeopardize our food supply. https://t.co/sLzDZDqrQUOur military leaders have told us – many times – that a strong State Department is critical to their mission. Now that Mike Pompeo has been confirmed to serve as America’s top diplomat, I hope he’ll follow their advice and put diplomacy first. https://t.co/GLx9aqzZYzFavorite meeting of the day. #TakeYourChildToWorkDay https://t.co/wYqCacKLbtMike Pompeo has repeatedly embraced military action over diplomatic solutions, supported interrogation techniques that amount to torture, &amp; smeared Muslim &amp; LGBTQ Americans. Tune in live as I speak about why he's unfit to serve as America’s chief diplomat: https://t.co/5NIqzBJ8xKFor a long time, Washington has worked for people who can write big campaign checks &amp; hire armies of lobbyists. But the Trump Admin doesn't even have the decency to be embarrassed for blatant corruption. The American people deserve better– we won't stop fighting until we get it. https://t.co/FDRKUIRYC4Valeria's little sister applied for DACA, but @realdonaldtrump ended it before she could get it. A federal judge just ruled that the government must resume accepting applications like hers – but the family’s future is still uncertain. Congress needs to pass the #DreamActNow. https://t.co/p8AlwRRibpThis is the most corrupt administration ever. https://t.co/uHr0tek2G1Federal judges are supposed to dispense equal justice under the law. But Kyle Duncan – @realdonaldtrump’s nominee for the 5th Circuit – has spent his career working to tilt the scales of justice against women, LGBTQ Americans, people of color, &amp; others. That's why I voted no. https://t.co/16xPZkbLuZI've been fighting to pass the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act, which will allow us to better protect the firefighters who put their lives on the line for us every day. That bill just passed out of committee – making it one step closer to becoming law. https://t.co/kJ7vPzNqVGBob’s resilience inspires me. He’s done so much for his community – and it’s time Congress is there for him and thousands of others across the country who are touched by the opioid epidemic. We must pass legislation to invest in treatment and research before more people die. https://t.co/PFNfJKsltBMike Pompeo’s brand of foreign policy doesn’t reflect America’s values, and won’t make us any safer. I urge my Senate colleagues to #StopPompeo and vote against his confirmation when it comes to the floor. https://t.co/9oXaFoz0a3After the Boston Marathon bombing, our whole country grieved – including people of Islamic faith. But Mike Pompeo used the tragedy to scapegoat Muslim Americans. Now he wants to speak for the US while working with our Muslim allies? We need to #StopPompeo. https://t.co/P7TSikdRGJA strong State Department requires a leader who actually believes in the power of diplomacy, and the importance of protecting human rights. Mike Pompeo does not. The Senate needs to #StopPompeo. https://t.co/Fj3vuyoQiQThis weekend, I met with members of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe to discuss the opioid crisis, which has hit Native communities particularly hard. My new bill, the #CAREact, would send $800M a year in federal funds directly to tribes to help end this crisis.https://t.co/NiK3aJRFV5The @nytimes lays out the history and scope of opioid addiction in America, lessons learned from our response to the AIDS epidemic, and possible solutions – including my bill with @RepCummings to spend $100 billion over 10 years on treatment &amp; research. https://t.co/JTDWMPqXMTLast year, I got a big stack of letters from the 7th graders at Clarke Middle School. They wrote to tell me how worried they are about climate change – and why we have to fix it. This #EarthDay, I hope you’ll join me – and these kids – in the fight to protect our planet. https://t.co/CjQ3e0YBNHThe federal government needs to get out of the business of outlawing marijuana. States should make their own decisions about enforcing marijuana laws.⚡️ Thirty years ago, Congress passed the Ryan White CARE Act to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This week, @RepCummings and I introduced a similar bill to fight the #opioidcrisis.

https://t.co/kIUXsPPLjWMost of the students marching in today’s #NationalSchoolWalkout were born after the Columbine shooting.

This is how we make change. #GunReformNow https://t.co/1btypgtbX2For months, @SenMarkey &amp; I have fought for Puerto Rican families who evacuated to Massachusetts after Hurricane Maria. Unless @FEMA acts soon, many could wind up homeless. These are fellow US citizens – this is unacceptable.https://t.co/4E5SvNzfTW.@SenDuckworth, I'm so glad to see the Senate take this baby step forward. I'll be the first in line to hold Maile when she makes it to the floor! https://t.co/hjnZAhXVmiEnough is enough. It’s time for the Trump Administration to step up and take responsibility for the repeated blackouts in Puerto Rico that have left millions of US citizens in the dark. I'll keep fighting to get answers and help for the people of #PuertoRico. https://t.co/PM7SuDCo5RI worked with @SenTedCruz to pass a bipartisan resolution designating today as Military Retiree Appreciation Day. As the sister of three vets, I know how much servicemembers contribute even after they leave the military – that deserves special recognition. https://t.co/s3L9l3jEkfWe can’t defeat the opioid crisis with empty words and half measures. Congress acted before to stop an epidemic when it finally took action against HIV/AIDS – and Americans across the country are counting on us to do the same today. #CAREact https://t.co/yotQ1IA8dqThe #CAREact includes $1 billion a year for clinics and non-profits to improve addiction treatment – along with $500 million to distribute overdose reversal drugs to first responders, health departments, and the public.In addition to funding for communities on the front lines of the opioid crisis, the #CAREact will provide $1.8 billion per year for biomedical research, better training for healthcare professionals, and public health surveillance, so we can better understand and treat addiction.The #CAREact will provide $4 billion per year to states, territories, and tribal governments. An additional $2.7 billion per year will go directly to the counties and cities hit hardest by the epidemic. https://t.co/RQyfCgycbdToday, @RepCummings and I are introducing the #CAREact. Our bill will provide $100 billion in federal funding over the next decade so we can treat the opioid crisis the same way we tackled the HIV/AIDS epidemic – like the critical public health emergency it is. https://t.co/v5EeJbl87UThe Senate is on the verge of voting to make it easier for auto lenders to discriminate. Here’s why I'm voting against the GOP's latest attack on the @CFPB and fair lending laws: https://t.co/qMiOyu2xjUHarry from Hull, MA tried everything to get his son out of an auto-loan scam, but no agency would help – until he contacted the @CFPB. @MickMulvaneyOMB has said we don't need a consumer protection bureau – but Harry and I disagree. American consumers need an agency on their side. https://t.co/WM5tR8Q3ClOn #OneBostonDay, we ask the rest of the world to join our city in doing one random act of kindness – big or small. Giving back reminds us that even in the darkest moments, we can respond with compassion and kindness. https://t.co/udiaEvuardAs we mark the fifth anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing, I'm grateful to Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes for championing this idea and bringing it to the finish line. Their story inspires us all. https://t.co/L9fd0CtvRzI introduced a bipartisan bill with @SenatorCollins named after Jessica &amp; Patrick to give other survivors of terrorism with traumatic injuries access to treatment at military health care facilities. We got key provisions into the defense authorization &amp; signed into law last year.Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes are a courageous young couple who both lost legs during the Boston Marathon bombing. After recovering at Walter Reed Medical, they started working to help other survivors of terrorism. https://t.co/Q6Ls8nxF90The Constitution gives Congress the power to authorize military action. If @realDonaldTrump wants to expand American military involvement in Syria's civil war, he must seek approval from Congress – &amp; provide a comprehensive strategy with clear goals &amp; a plan to achieve them.(2/2)Chemical attacks in Syria are horrifying, and a clear violation of international law. The world must hold Assad accountable for his violence against the Syrian people – and the US should be part of a planned, coordinated multilateral effort.(1/2)Time may be running out. Congress must immediately pass this bipartisan bill to ensure that Mueller can complete a full, independent investigation. Let’s send a loud, clear message that no one is above the law – not even the President of the United States. https://t.co/7mko7P7bDWThe Washington swamp just got a little dirtier. The Senate just voted to confirm former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to be second in command at the @EPA. Now he could work to poison the agency – and the environment he's supposed to protect – for years to come.On Yom Hashoah, #WeRemember the 6 million Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust. We honor their memories by continuing to stand up against hate and bigotry wherever they exist..@realDonaldTrump has sworn up and down that he won't support bad trade deals. He pulled out of the TPP after he was elected – but now he wants back in. It’s a ridiculous reversal &amp; a slap in the face to the hard-working Americans Trump promised to fight for. TPP is a lousy deal. https://t.co/9hXka7WiN2The @CFPB was created to protect people. If @MickMulvaneyOMB wants to prevent the agency from stopping scams &amp; helping consumers, he needs to explain that to Ari, Harry, and the millions of Americans who believe the @CFPB should have their backs. https://t.co/tUWkQiW9DNHarry from Hull, MA told the @CFPB about his son’s shady auto-loan. The agency looked into his complaint &amp; forced those companies to refund $6.5 million to over 50k active-duty servicemembers. Harry came to the hearing today because he wants the @CFPB to keep helping people.One of those people is Ari. Before he deployed to Iraq, he bought a truck and got pushed into a subprime auto-loan scam that cost him more than 60% of his monthly paycheck. His dad Harry contacted the @CFPB on his behalf while he was deployed.I just finished questioning @MickMulvaneyOMB in a Senate hearing. Before he started running the @CFPB, he tried to kill it repeatedly. If he’d gotten his wish, billions of dollars would still be sitting at the companies that cheated customers – instead of the people they cheated..@MickMulvaneyOMB has been bringing up my name a lot lately when talking about the @CFPB. But what he doesn’t get is that this isn’t about me. It’s about the millions of Americans who want someone to go after the companies that cheated them. https://t.co/FFNuxFU0rDIt’s been four months since @MickMulvaneyOMB took over the @CFPB – and he hasn’t lifted a finger to help consumers. Today, he’s testifying before Congress, and the American people expect some answers. Watch live: https://t.co/4MVSeEnRb9The #BankLobbyistAct is dangerous enough, but now House Republicans want to load the bill up with even more favors for the financial industry. Senate supporters of the bill need to keep their word, oppose new additions, &amp; stop a bad bill from getting worse.https://t.co/b2R1PIhKqbWomen should be paid the same as men for doing the same work – period.

Most Americans know that's ridiculous. Yesterday, a federal court in Massachusetts said so when it upheld our assault weapons ban. https://t.co/Gy1iocFFPB.@ICEgov has changed its policy to allow increased detention of pregnant women, despite reports of mistreatment &amp; miscarriages. Pregnant women should be treated with dignity – regardless of their immigration status. This new policy seriously jeopardizes their health &amp; wellbeing. https://t.co/gWiUShnHCrSenator Daniel Akaka leaves a remarkable legacy.

The current nominee, Mike Pompeo, has defended the use of torture, tried to undermine the Iran nuclear deal, and scapegoated Muslim Americans after the Boston Marathon bombing. I won’t vote to confirm him.Last year, I wrote to Ginnie Mae – a federal agency – &amp; asked it to go after mortgage lenders who exploit veterans with shady mortgage refinances. Ginnie Mae just said it will crack down on 2 of the worst offenders. This is good news for vets &amp; taxpayers. https://t.co/qr2mtKTttpTen years after the financial crisis, banks are making record profits while wages for working families have barely ticked up.

I've long been skeptical of trade policy – both at home and abroad – that caters to big corporations instead of working families.In my meetings with Chinese government officials, we discussed the challenge posed by North Korea and the need for a diplomatic solution. I urged China to continue enforcing international sanctions until we see clear evidence that North Korea has changed its behavior.In Beijing, I had candid discussions with Chinese officials about US-China relations, acknowledging both our shared interests and our areas of disagreement, including my concerns about China's treatment of human rights.Thousands of Americans who served their communities were at risk of being denied federal student loan relief.

In Seoul, I met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha &amp; National Security Office Director Chung Eui-yong. They are our critical allies in the preservation of peace &amp; security in the Asia Pacific region. https://t.co/8KmySZ20sA.@MickMulvaneyOMB is ignoring the @CFPB’s mission and failing to comply with legal mandates – he’s doing his best to turn the CFPB into the politicized rogue agency he’s accused it of being. Republicans remain silent. I have something to say about that: https://t.co/vyzgFTpg5BDefeating a public health epidemic like the opioid crisis isn't easy. It takes major resources, local control, &amp; the courage to combat stigmas. But we know what needs to be done. We've come together before to save lives – it's time for us to do so again. https://t.co/yotQ1IA8dqJust like HIV/AIDS, we should ensure that every single American who needs addiction treatment and support gets it, without delay. That’s how we end the opioid crisis – not with speeches, but with treatment.Our proposal isn't about public declarations and empty words. Just like HIV/AIDS, we need to provide communities that are battling the opioid epidemic every day with the funding and tools they so desperately need.The Ryan White CARE Act transformed how America treats HIV/AIDS. Congress must show the same political courage on opioids that our colleagues showed 30 years ago. @RepCummings and I propose a parallel approach for opioids – investing in research &amp; in treatment at the local level.Thanks to the Ryan White CARE Act, over half a million people a year with HIV/AIDS receive vital services. The epidemic isn’t over – but now life-saving medications are available, new infections have plummeted, and science – rather than stigma – guides medical care.In 1990, Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked together to pass the bipartisan Ryan White CARE Act – named in honor of a teen from Indiana who was diagnosed with AIDS at age 13. The law transformed our approach to treatment and provided significant new funding.Three decades ago, an epidemic swept across our country, killing tens of thousands of people each year. Stigma prevented many from seeking treatment. Doctors and lawmakers alike were stumped on how to treat this rapidly evolving crisis. It wasn't opioids – it was HIV/AIDS.Politicians treat the opioid crisis like it's some new, intractable problem. It's not. 30 years ago, Congress passed a law to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic – and it worked. Today, @RepCummings and I call on Congress to pass a similar law for opioids. https://t.co/yotQ1IA8dqTom Hoenig – a top banking regulator &amp; political Independent – said the #BankLobbyistAct makes a serious mistake by weakening capital standards for big banks. He’s right. Inadequate capital at big banks helped create the financial crisis. We shouldn’t go down that road again. https://t.co/hc7h6WTt1YThe census must count every person. Our Constitution demands it. Our democracy requires it. @realDonaldTrump is jeopardizing its accuracy by adding an unnecessary citizenship question.

If we want to succeed in Asia, America needs a foreign policy that leverages all our national power – not just our military might. https://t.co/eW98gAS4hYThe only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether they can handle the job. By putting gender identity first, @realDonaldTrump undermines readiness and caters to extremists who don't respect the sacrifices of our troops. Shameful.Happy 8th birthday to the ACA – which forced insurers to start putting patients over profits and made a huge difference in the lives of millions of people. We've fought hard for it – and now we’re fighting for better, more affordable care for all. https://t.co/DMOxD1u0gSSpending tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money on fancy furniture is outrageous, but the biggest scandal of Ben Carson's tenure is his refusal to enforce the laws that reduce housing discrimination and segregation in this country. https://t.co/g9Tx0ZDQDq.@realDonaldTrump promised to reduce US involvement in wars overseas, but his new National Security Advisor has never met a war he didn’t like. The last thing we need is someone like John Bolton who embraces military solutions first and puts us all at risk.Finding affordable child care today can be an impossible task. That’s why I fought tooth &amp; nail to nearly double child care funding in this year’s federal budget to $2.37B – the largest increase in the history of the program that will help tens of thousands of families. https://t.co/twTEt2PZgcThe @NewYorkFed is about to choose its next president.

https://t.co/kJNpvWeVtfBig corporations are using the GOP tax scam to reward CEOs while laying off workers. @SenatorBaldwin has a new bill to rein in stock buybacks and give workers a stronger voice. I’m with her all the way. https://t.co/t84mRNrENhThe #BankLobbyistAct is only going to get worse. House Republicans &amp; bank lobbyists want the bill to roll back more consumer protections and include more big bank giveaways. Senate supporters of this bill must not let a bad bill get even more dangerous. https://t.co/7FDSPyfhRYToo many Americans have to battle with their insurance companies just to see their doctor or get a prescription filled. We need a health care system that puts patients first – not insurance companies. https://t.co/kQKSN143gaIn Massachusetts, we have the highest health care coverage rate &amp; some of the lowest premiums in the country. That didn’t happen by accident: we set tough rules for insurance companies &amp; insisted they focus on families over profits. We can do the same at the federal level.My new bill would help stop the nasty tricks that insurance companies use to hold our health care hostage and drive up costs for families – and build on the ACA to improve the quality &amp; affordability of health insurance. https://t.co/2uXUQ3gBTCToday I’m introducing the Consumer Health Insurance Protection Act with @SenSanders &amp; our colleagues.

https://t.co/8JduzslDl0 https://t.co/iCupDUx2gMIf we want to make the promise of our legal system real, then everyone must be held equally accountable when they break our laws. We can start by bringing the white supremacists who attacked DeAndre Harris in Charlottesville to justice.DeAndre Harris was severely beaten by white supremacists in Charlottesville. Were those men brought to justice? No. Instead, DeAndre was prosecuted for accidentally hitting a while supremacist with a flashlight. It's absolutely mind-boggling.The words above the Supreme Court read "Equal Justice Under Law" – and that's supposed to be the basic promise of our legal system. But the DeAndre Harris case shows us we still have a long way to go. https://t.co/kRqLEtslVKWe need to hold our partners and allies accountable for using the weapons and resources we provide them.

She’ll be greatly missed by so many – my heart goes out to her family and staff. https://t.co/wxPs8jlsOFDear Tim Sloan: @WellsFargo is getting sanctioned by regulators left and right. You already made 291x more than your average employee. Now you’re getting a $4.6 million raise and want praise because you’re not getting a bonus on top? You should be fired, not rewarded. https://t.co/Vr6rBG94xOBig banks like @WellsFargo won't clean up their act until executives start facing real consequences. I introduced the “Ending Too Big to Jail Act” to make sure executives who cheat their customers get hit with jail time – not raises.  https://t.co/dT9V2Uz8Mz.@WellsFargo is about to be sanctioned for running an auto insurance scam that cost Americans millions of dollars. I don’t think that sort of corporate management merits a raise for CEO Tim Sloan.  https://t.co/0B3pTzgd98.@WellsFargo got a bigger handout from the GOP tax scam than any other company – and what does it do with this huge financial windfall? Turns around and hands $4.6 million to CEO Tim Sloan. https://t.co/OfQm8taReW.@WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan enabled the bank’s massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, and helped cover it up. He should have been fired – instead, he just got a big, fat raise. https://t.co/4Y7ttct3x7When the Senate passed the #BankLobbyistAct yesterday, the banks and their lobbyists won big. Now they say this is only “a first step.” Does Congress plan to keep letting lobbyists run this place? https://t.co/qp4pFiEcCG https://t.co/rlXBLXHvrGCongress doesn’t have the courage to act on gun violence, but these young people won't stop fighting until we do. I'm with them all the way. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/8kxIweYavLAn Equifax executive was just charged with insider trading – but the Senate still passed the #BankLobbyistAct to roll back oversight of huge financial institutions. Did we learn nothing from the #EquifaxBreach? We need more accountability – not less.
https://t.co/nMNeVTpRHSThe American people aren’t going to stand by while big banks and giant corporations run this economy and this Congress for their own benefit. Soon – maybe not today, or next week, or even in the next election – but soon, they will demand a government that works for the people.I’m not giving up. We need real accountability for big banks – and the people who run them. I just introduced a new bill – the Ending Too Big to Jail Act – to help ensure bank executives are hauled out of their offices in handcuffs when they break the law. https://t.co/dT9V2Uz8MzExactly ten years after the financial crisis began, the Senate has voted 67-31 to pass the #BankLobbyistAct and roll back important regulations on America’s biggest banks. We fought hard, but the big banks and their lobbyists won this round.Instead of working to #EndGunViolence – Republicans and Democrats came together today to deregulate the big banks and set the stage for another financial crash. Bankers are popping champagne because the #BankLobbyistAct just passed the Senate.Torture doesn’t just violate our values, it jeopardizes our nat'l security and puts our military at risk. Gina Haspel’s involvement in the US’s discredited torture program makes her unfit to lead the CIA. I stand with @RandPaul, @RonWyden, &amp; other Senators against her nomination.I’m heading to the Senate floor one last time to try and convince the Senate to reject the #BankLobbyistAct.

Here's a tip @SecretaryAcosta: You should withdraw this anti-worker rule right now. https://t.co/toKTl9UJQfTune in live as I talk about a part of the #BankLobbyistAct that keeps me awake at night – the part that guts our ability to find and go after mortgage discrimination by exempting 85% of banks from reporting data about the loans they make.https://t.co/TAdsMndBDJThese aren't “community banks” – these are huge financial institutions that wrecked out economy in 2008 &amp; sucked down about $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts. The #BankLobbyistAct takes them off the watch list &amp; puts us at risk for another financial crisis.https://t.co/kqrJ4p2bG0Zions Bancorporation got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But last spring the CEO begged to be taken off the government watch list. He got his wish – the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @ZionsBank as your local community bank.Comerica Incorporated controls about $72 billion in assets today &amp; has naming rights to a MLB stadium – but taxpayers spent $2.25 billion bailing it out during the 2008 financial crisis. And the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @ComericaCares as if it were a tiny community bank.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @Huntington_Bank as your local community bank.Regions Financial Corporation has about 1,500 branches and 1,900 ATMs. It also got $3.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. If the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @askRegions could get the same level of federal oversight as a small community bank.Keycorp is doing pretty well these days – it made almost $1.3 billion last year. That’s a lot of growth since the 2008 crash, when it got $2.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate KeyCorp as if it were a small community bank.Fifth Third Bancorp got $3.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis and has more than 1,100 branches. But if the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @fifththird could get the same amount of federal oversight as your local community bank.BB&amp;T Corporation has over 2,000 branches across the country and controls $221 billion in assets. It received $3.13 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @BBT as your neighborhood community bank.SunTrust Bank got $4.85B in taxpayer bailouts after the financial crisis. It’s recovered pretty well. It controls $206B in assets and has a MLB stadium named after it. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @Suntrust as if it were a small community bank.The #BankLobbyistAct will roll back rules on 25 of America’s 40 biggest banks. Combined, they got nearly $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts after the 2008 financial crisis – and they’re back to making record profits.America's biggest banks crashed the economy and took billions in taxpayer bailouts. Today, they're making record profits. But they still want more and their wish list is in the #BankLobbyistAct, which the Senate plans to pass this week. I'll fight it to the bitter end. https://t.co/iPVZeAvZKH.@BetsyDeVosED has bent over backwards to allow students to be cheated, taken an axe to public education, and undermined the civil rights of students across the country – and she needs to be held accountable. Track her "progress" on #DeVosWatch: https://t.co/i3tEGaJcryThe Secretary of Education is supposed to advocate for public education – but @BetsyDeVosED thinks public schools are a "dead end." She's focused on an agenda designed to weaken public schools – putting millions of students at risk. https://t.co/jhrdUrnb33It's only taken @BetsyDeVosED a year to turn back the clock on students' civil rights. She's gone after protections for victims of sexual assault, LGBTQ students, and students of color. https://t.co/yFmSXr2YmjYou'll be shocked to hear that @BetsyDeVosED's 1st year at @usedgov was a total failure. Instead of supporting students &amp; teachers, she's been working to make life easier for student loan companies &amp; her friends in the predatory #4profit college industry. https://t.co/ojFkP2KB7E.@BetsyDeVosEd should be able to answer basic questions about the public school system. A year into her term as Secretary of Education, @RepKClark and I thought it was time for a report card: https://t.co/dkILsACNW9If you have any doubt that @BetsyDeVosED is completely unqualified to run the Department of Education – you should take a look at her recent interview with @60minutes. https://t.co/eNmzfIbUolDo you think Congress should relax the rules on the big banks that got bailed out by taxpayers?

Here's why this bill is bad for working families and the future of our financial system. https://t.co/s8aZ3u5G0SThe #BankLobbyistAct rolls back the rules on the biggest banks in the country and increases the chances of another taxpayer bailout. How can any Senator vote for that? https://t.co/8oxAoIawtDHear Mr. Estrada’s story and you’ll know why we can’t pass the #BankLobbyistAct next week. We can’t go back to a world where the banks run wild and families like the Estradas are left holding the bag. https://t.co/ULpd6I7YqvToday @BetsyDeVosEd told state governments they can't hold student loan companies accountable when they break state law. The Senate could stand up for students and block her move with my amendment to the #BankLobbyistAct. https://t.co/ojFkP2KB7EHistory is repeating itself with the #BankLobbyistAct, as Republicans and Democrats prepare to vote to roll back regulations on big banks. Don't you think we should have learned our lesson by now? https://t.co/7rUKIajJ8QIn the late 1990s, Senator Paul Wellstone tried to warn Congress against rolling back major federal regulations on banks.

So when THEY say the #BankLobbyistAct "will make the financial system more vulnerable in a panic" by gutting big bank rules, you know it's time to oppose the bill.https://t.co/LIET5sVRLTThe people of Massachusetts didn’t send me to the Senate to fight for big banks. They sent me here to fight for them. And so long as I am privileged to hold this job, that’s exactly what I’m going to do.I have to call it like I see it. And the truth is the #BankLobbyistAct is a giant gift to the big banks that could put us on track for another financial crash and hurt America’s working families.Calling out members of my own party who are supporting the #BankLobbyistAct doesn’t make me the most popular kid on the team. But that's not why I ran for the Senate. https://t.co/RWBCNVqhaN2006: This CEO says it's safe to deregulate his big bank.

This week: A bunch of Senators side with him over taxpayers by voting for the #BankLobbyistAct. https://t.co/UmcYLgf2DZIf we're going to vote on the #BankLobbyistAct – we should vote on each of these amendments so the American people know whose side their senators are on: Working families or big banks.17. Amend Section 401 of the #BankLobbyistAct so it doesn't provide big banks with the giant legal loophole they need to challenge how the Fed regulates them. https://t.co/lyyAFKG4c016. Amend Section 303 of the #BankLobbyistAct to keep seniors safe from financial abuse while still protecting them from bank scams. https://t.co/QOTA7KBNdx15.

Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent banks that receive regulatory rollbacks from this bill from merging or acquiring another bank for 5 years. Loosening the rules on these big banks will lead to more consolidation in the banking industry unless Congress prohibits it. https://t.co/nnjTTQcpt05. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent banks that receive regulatory rollbacks as a result of this bill from buying back stock for 5 years. Why would we loosen the rules on big banks just so they can shower more money on wealthy shareholders and executives? https://t.co/aGVTMg47qM4. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that have outsourced more than 50 jobs in the last 5 years.

These banks have caused enough damage already – think of the harm they could do with even fewer rules. https://t.co/rzkk7EXMDg2.

If it passes, it'll be harder to police banks that sell abusive mortgages and lenders who discriminate against their customers. https://t.co/EVRcHmPGQ1Senate Republicans voted unanimously for the #BankLobbyistAct. But this bill wouldn’t be on the path to becoming law without the support of these Democrats. The Senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again. https://t.co/bfkEgNdl9CSenator Elizabeth Warren answers questions about the #BankLobbyistAct https://t.co/h6zn2h31DxInstead of seeking out thank you letters from big banks and their lobbyists, we should be working on what our constituents want.

These banks got $30B in bailouts just a few years ago, but they are still able to get Senators of both parties to do their bidding and roll back the rules. https://t.co/M2bMtkoU7r21,000 Dreamers have already lost their status.
