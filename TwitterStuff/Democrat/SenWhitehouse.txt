Great to meet yesterday with RI music educators.  Thanks for helping our kids spark their creativity! https://t.co/rwtgw8ln7wThanks for bringing some electricity to Congress! https://t.co/H1qXfSUGVqThe Senate has passed our bill to dedicate the Bristol post office in memory of 1st Sergeant Andrew McKenna, who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. It will stand as a reminder to Rhode Islanders forever that Sergeant McKenna was a hero and a patriot.Once again, raises the big unanswered question:  what cooperation, coordination or collusion has there been between House investigators and Trump team?   Do they meet?  Do they text or email?  Do they exchange messages through intermediaries?  

https://t.co/FXxLEwgAA8House Rs badgered IRS Commissioner mercilessly to protect “dark money” in politics. Now badgering Rosenstein mercilessly to protect Trump from investigation. How many court-approved warrants, indictments &amp; guilty pleas does it take to show this is serious?
https://t.co/h8ci11lnqILots to worry about in a Trump Supreme Court nominee.  The end of a woman’s freedom to make her own decisions about pregnancy?  The end of insurance protection for pre-existing medical conditions?  More special-interest misrule in our government?  Strap in, folks..@SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. Well, we agree, Mitch. That’s why we introduced the DISCLOSE Act. Hope you support it too. https://t.co/qF8ZkwFJHPCan you guess who once said election spending should be “limited and       disclosed” so that “everyone knows who’s supporting everyone else”?Secret election spending has exploded since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and it’s drowning out Americans’ voices. To fight back, we need to pass the DISCLOSE Act. https://t.co/qF8ZkwFJHPEven before we have a nominee, dark money special interests go to work. https://t.co/tcmhBPzvjV"...for humans to injure other humans with disease; for humans to contaminate the Earth’s waters, its land, its air, and its life, with poisonous substances, these are sins.” - Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople"For humans to cause species to become extinct and to destroy the biological diversity of God’s creation; for humans to degrade the integrity of Earth by causing changes in its climate, by stripping the Earth of its natural forests, or destroying its wetlands...Here's my statement on Justice Kennedy's plan to retire: https://t.co/YRfWVKc6qLCheck out my Facebook Live with @davidcicilline on our bill to bring transparency to campaign spending.  @peoplefor @Public_Citizen https://t.co/NNWIfYfoXzHere's my statement on SCOTUS's decision in #Janus today: https://t.co/MLR8S2e2lbThanks to the RI students from @SADDnation who visited me today to talk about keeping teens safe. https://t.co/2AXYmvYZA6Even now, fossil-fuel-funded climate deniers are still lying. https://t.co/II3uvcAum7Here's my statement on the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Trump Muslim ban: https://t.co/7xMxFHimCBCockroaches scuttle back to their holes when you flick on the lights.  Time to illuminate who is behind the artificial apparatus propagating weaponized fake news and phony science denial.   It’s a scam; perhaps the biggest scam ever.As politically-weaponized fake news and polluter-funded climate denial poison our discourse, it’s ever more important that Americans understand who’s behind the poison.  Often, there is method, purpose and motive.  Exposing that is the best response.  
https://t.co/5rPBXbY20BOnce again, no one is asking about the elephant in the room: what collusion or coordination has there been between the Trump legal team &amp; House “investigators”? Is this real oversight, or calculated and collusive obstruction? 
https://t.co/4Y3twM3ArhSCOTUS is poised to decide the critically important Janus v. AFSCME case this week. Worker protections and a lot more is on the line. Here’s my piece in @Slate on what to look for and why it matters: https://t.co/VtaUP4OPblHappy to join the groundbreaking for facilities at Electric Boat in @QuonsetRI that will support the construction of new submarines. We are so proud to show the world what RI can do. https://t.co/khqtlKo7kKThanks to @RIMarineTrades, @ritextiles, and @ricomposites for weighing in on how this initiative would help RI manufacturers.Manufacturers face new workforce challenges as more Baby Boomers retire. Today at Cooley Group I announced my bill to make RI manufacturers more competitive by creating a program to keep retiring employees on to train their replacements so they can hit the ground running. https://t.co/rYnmntdpNSSeems highly improbable that “Mueller is contemplating the end of his work” before resolving Manafort/Cohen cooperation. That would be malpractice. More likely spreading elements of the case throughout DOJ (EDVA &amp; SDNY already) to make it harder to uproot. https://t.co/zK2w0W15r4"No deal on Middle East peace. No deal on the Qatar blockade. No deal on Syria. No deal on Russia. No deal on Iran. No deal on climate change. No deal on Pacific trade.

https://t.co/ErwK0HL80DThanks @MiddletownPD Chief Pesare for all you’re doing to help those struggling with addiction &amp; for your support of our bipartisan bill to curb the opioid epidemic. The CARA 2.0 bill would expand treatment for soon-to-be and new moms and their newborns. https://t.co/XhU69UO2hzMy carbon fee bill returns most funds to the American people directly, but some through states, which face different individual problems and need to tailor home-state solutions. Whatever works, I’m for. But let’s leave room to make sure we can get it done. https://t.co/69xlMpH2E8This is an important step. But will Exxon &amp; the fossil fuel cartel really support it, or continue saying one thing while deploying their political agents to prevent the result they claim to seek? Let’s hope that at last this is real. We’ll see soon enough.https://t.co/CYSnxqnUjIBig oil companies say they support a carbon price.  In fact, their political apparatus opposes the outcome they claim to seek.  This new group puts a fine point on that conflict between what the oil companies say and what they do.  
https://t.co/t3hHiJUSwYFor the record: A) We did, w bipartisan Senate immigration reform, and House Republicans refused to take it up; B) when we tried recently on #DACA, @realDonaldTrump kneecapped his own Republican negotiators.  
https://t.co/febeA9THHLCongratulations to @Atul_Gawande. This could be a really big deal.
https://t.co/TuiMYBpxnf.Our letter signals we have the votes to keep destructive anti-environmental riders out of this year’s appropriations bills. Read it here: https://t.co/r9CQxNS42MI'm proud Americans are making it clear to @realDonaldTrump that they're outraged and they won't be ignored. Thanks to everyone at the Coalition to Value Families rally against Trump's child separation policy today. You’re right--this isn't over. We need to keep fighting. https://t.co/UmMByfNOE7I’m proud of the American people’s outrage at separating little children from moms and dads.  Trump caved, because America sent a loud, firm message of our decency.  To all who made their voices heard, thank you and God bless you.

I was pleased to work with my colleagues in the delegation to make this increased funding available to help RI fight the epidemic. https://t.co/TSdJ4UHqsqIt is absolutely not necessary to prosecute every single asylum seeker who crosses the border in the wrong place. https://t.co/oP7Gq2RCYJPeople crossing the border may be poor and frightened and seeking the safety that the United States has long represented for refugees. https://t.co/iasKnvYEfkNothing about all of the administration’s explanations looks as bad as the image of children behind chain link fences under Mylar blankets, and the sounds of them crying in captivity. https://t.co/xT4KwgQLiEAlways great to see the excellent advocates from @PanCANRI, who are in DC today to #DemandBetter for pancreatic cancer patients and their families. Proud to stand with them. https://t.co/hpvGhIAoPLThank you @alzassocri for playing an such important role in the fight against this disease. https://t.co/2PaVm3KMYYOn the heartless Trump tactic of separating little children from mothers, it’s not just their lying that gets me; they no longer even try &amp; get their lies straight w/ each other.

https://t.co/mZhc7YwSwhDon’t count me among “Democrats [who] won’t like” Comey report.  He broke the rules.  His self-aggrandizing excuses were wrong.  He did good things in his career, but his Clinton investigation episode was bad.

Line up Flynn, Cohen and Manafort as cooperating prosecution witnesses and you’ve got a prospect that explains the panic in Trumpland.First it was, “We’re going after those DACA kids unless we get our Wall!”  Now it’s, “We’re taking little kids away from their parents unless we get our Wall!”  Enough with the political hostage-taking, already.  
https://t.co/oW3nO96Q2CWhiff of Panic:  Trump/Giuliani/McCarthy all calling to end Mueller probe over @JusticeOIG report saying @Comey broke rules in way that helped Trump.  Follow THAT logic.

https://t.co/ms0YHZmcyJRead my statement on the @JusticeOIG report. https://t.co/Sok1gPsw3mTearing children away from their families is cruel. Not only is it wrong, but it can actually cause “irreparable harm to their future health,” according to @AmerAcadPeds. Let’s stop hurting children, because #FamiliesBelongTogetherBeware bogus Republican talking points: Giuliani took years investigating “Tony” Salerno and no one told him to “wrap it up.”  Investigations can take time, and need to run their proper course.      
https://t.co/QJgS8PIyAZAnd thanks again to @NatGeo for great images.From days when I first held hearing on this, and brought @JambeckResearch to speak at #EEODayRI, ocean plastics has exploded into serious effort by G7 (minus Trump), UN, hospitality chains, plastics industry, all over—now India! 
https://t.co/S4kfvSnsxZA cosmic convergence of creeps.  
https://t.co/itkqnvxLzZGreat piece on sea level rise, and a sad reminder that fossil-fuel-funded climate denial is still alive and well, and even given sanctuary still in the @WSJopinion pages.   A shame.  
https://t.co/OyTBC0wHaKI saw the movie “Shock and Awe,” about the one news agency that got the story right in the Bush rush to war in Iraq. One hero: @JonathanLanday, son of the late Jerry Landay of Bristol.  Jerry was a great reporter in his own day.  Great job, Jonathan!Watch House Rs whine when the tables are turned and there is discussion of legal process to gain access to their documents. One key question:  what would those documents reveal about collusion between Trump lawyers and the House staff harassing DOJ?

I hope we can progress beyond this list to a meaningful accord that yields lasting peace.A path to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is welcome, but the announcement President Trump and Chairman Kim made leaves many questions unanswered.Two years ago, 49 men &amp; women were brutally gunned down at the Pulse nightclub shooting. Thoughts and prayers are not enough, so we must #HonorThemWithAction. It’s long past time we put an end to anti-LGBTQ hatred and vicious gun violence.Missed opportunity on ocean plastics in automatic Trump administration reflex to support any and all polluters.  
https://t.co/YUGJkTDcrTThere is a disturbing trend to the 5-4 decisions of the Court’s Republican appointees: they all seem to benefit the GOP at the polls (like this decision) or benefit big Republican corporate donor interests (like the recent Epic Systems decision).
https://t.co/uJvztTltoN.@realDonaldTrump’s new policy of cruelly ripping children from their parents at the border is un-American &amp; bad for kids’ health. @SenJackReed &amp; I are calling on the Admin. to immediately stop this &amp; join us in working toward bipartisan immigration reform. https://t.co/FpNnGCFWIpThanks to all who marched from all of us here in the Ocean State! https://t.co/Jq4wlx7MBh.@ProJo full of RI inspiration today:  Sister Mary and Sophia Academy; WWII Corsair pilot and Cranston Print Works CEO Fred Rockefeller; DeCubellis family mission honoring Katie.A Republican former Attorney General speaks out.

5) can’t be charged as President with any offense.  
I think he’s 0 for 5.The Trump Swamp just keeps getting swampier.
https://t.co/l8eEWYKhvFThe one person most likely to be smiling as Trump sunders trade relations with the United States’ best allies is Vladimir Putin.

https://t.co/Zd27x9SljbAnybody trusting this crew to help on climate change needs to have their head examined. Big Oil takes care of Big Oil. Period. https://t.co/jgAHfUcmwuTypical that Exxon wants to derail investigation that would lead to depositions, discovery, etc. Exxon “wanting to be part of the solution to climate change” is PR, not real; all Exxon’s political force is deployed against climate legislation. https://t.co/Yo0lqsZULLLike other oil companies, Shell supports the Paris agreement with talk. Don’t buy it.  Politically, its henchmen oppose climate action in Congress.All fossil fuel polluters want out of the courts (where they have to tell the truth and disclose documents) in favor of legislatures they can influence and control. 
https://t.co/GsgaaYc3wXThese increases are the result of @realDonaldTrump’s deliberate attempt to dismantle the ACA. While RI’ers have been protected from colossal premium spikes seen in other states, health care costs are stretching family budgets. https://t.co/xMcMUXrmbmNo surprise. It was always a huge donor payback scheme with taxpayer money. Nearly $2 trillion on the credit card, for this.Republican tax scam results: “the main use of corporate America’s tax savings will be takeovers and stock buybacks rather than capital investment or hiring.” 
https://t.co/3PgLvZuNEdIt’s more like Putin separating adoptive parents from children to deter U.S. sanctions against his oligarchs.Cruelty cannot be our policy. The Trump Administration’s inhumane practice of separating tiny children from their mothers is supposed to deter families fleeing to the United States. That’s not a strategy I associate with America.Well, let’s see.  They could go with what 97% of scientists think (number is actually a virtual 100%).  Or they could go with what 97% of their fossil fuel donors tell ‘em to do.  Guess we know how that works out.

This will be my last tweet out under Kelly’s watchful eye on Team SW; she starts Tuesday at EPW.And Clapper comes clean that Russia actually tipped the election to Trump: “it exceeds logic and credulity that they didn’t affect the election. And it’s my belief they actually turned it.” https://t.co/If3AaVMY0TClapper corrects the record on Trump’s phony “Spygate”: “The objective here was actually to protect the campaign by determining whether the Russians were infiltrating it and attempting to exert influence.” https://t.co/G8fxDhTZcYFounding Fathers set up courts for this.

A vote on the Senate floor. I look forward to the bill getting swift consideration before the Senate. Thanks to my Democratic and Republican colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee for working together.The bill requires the Corps to study the durability of hurricane barriers, like the one that protects Providence, in the face of sea level rise and storms. It also encourages the Corps to look to state coastal plans, like @RI_CRMC’s SAMPs, for future work.In Rhode Island and across the country, our water infrastructure needs significant investments to keep up with current demand and prepare for climate change. That’s why I’m proud this legislation includes a bill I cosponsored that would help finance water needs.I’m also proud that the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 includes my provision that requires the Army Corps to report on its research and make recommendations on expanded use of composites, such as those made by RI manufacturers, and other innovative materials.The America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 will direct the Army Corps of Engineers to complete ongoing projects in RI, including those that address coastal flooding risks and navigation in the Providence River.

Today’s words must be followed up with meaningful action. Real changes will require legislative action and bipartisan compromise. We’re ready.Instead of working with us on those proposals, @SenateGOP passed the #GOPTaxScam, which has resulted in the 10 biggest drug companies using the windfall to purchase their own stock instead of lowering drug prices for Americans.I have been fighting alongside @SenateDems for years to lower prescription drug prices.
