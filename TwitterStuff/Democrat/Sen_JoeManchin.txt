So for Mike Pence to come in yesterday &amp; start firing shots is not leadership. I’d simply urge Mr. Pence to show better leadership qualities.My record speaks for itself. If they’re attacking people like me then they don't want bipartisanship. They are not committed or sincere about making government work.I've voted 54% of the time with the Trump Administration when I think it’s what’s best for #WV. There isn’t another person in Congress who votes as bipartisan as I do.They also wanted to kill healthcare access for 200k West Virginians &amp; bankrupt our #WV hospitals. I cosponsored 2 bipartisan bills that would prevent this. Again, they chose to be partisan.Mike Pence talks a good game as far as bipartisanship but I met with their team 21 times to make tax cuts larger &amp; permanent for the middle class, not big businesses and millionaires. They decided to be strictly partisan instead of helping the middle class West Virginians.The VP’s comments are exactly why Washington Sucks. I’m disappointed in his comments but will continue to work to make Washington work so #WV &amp; our country work.Last week, I worked in a bipartisan way with Senator Collins to end the shutdown, &amp; last night President Trump called for unity &amp; bipartisanship.I am shocked that after the @VP worked for almost a year in a divisive &amp; partisan way to take healthcare away from almost 200k WVians, bankrupt our hospitals &amp; push tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans &amp; huge corporations that he would come to #WV &amp; continue partisan attacks.Thanks to everyone who joined us at my town hall in Moorefield today.

Vote coming soon..@SenatorCollins &amp; I just finished a bipartisan meeting with 22 of our Senate colleagues that are committed to reopening the government. This #shutdown is ridiculous - plain &amp; simple. https://t.co/6W6yU1MxLWIf Congress can’t come together to fulfill one of our most basic constitutional obligations, then we don’t deserve to get paid either. Yesterday I intro'd legislation to withhold Congress' pay during a government #shutdown https://t.co/TGZUpbvLYLGoverning this way is dangerous for our country &amp; I'm doing everything I can to ensure this #shutdown ends swiftly. Do you have questions about how this shutdown will impact you &amp; your family in #WV? This Q&amp;A may be helpful. 
 https://t.co/CSqvrOpMYcWe must come together to do our job, &amp; find a solution to reopen the government as soon as possible. I will work around the clock in order to get that done.Funding the government is one of our most basic constitutional obligations &amp; now because of partisan politics, the government will shut down. Governing this way is dangerous to our national security and embarrassing for both political parties.Governing this way is dangerous to our national security &amp; embarrassing for both political parties. I urge my colleagues to come together, do our job, &amp; find a solution that keeps our government running. I’m prepared to stay here as long as it takes to get that done.Funding the government is one of our most basic constitutional obligations. We cannot keep kicking the can down the road just to face the same problems a month later.We have important work to do including ensuring our military is equipped to protect our country, fighting the opioid epidemic, keeping our promise to miners so they don’t lose their pensions, funding #CHIP &amp; CHC's, expanding broadband access &amp; passing an infrastructure package.We are already more than 3 months in to FY 2018 &amp; we still don’t have a plan to fund our government. Every time we pass short-term funding, we put our national security at risk, we stall critical projects &amp; throw our economy &amp; our citizens into limb.Today, I will vote to keep the government open for a fourth time for FY2018 through a continuing resolution. Just because I will vote to pass this doesn’t mean I like it.I have never &amp; will never vote to shutdown the government.In December a #WV Veteran contacted my office because his surgery at the Clarksburg VA was halted due to spots on the tools processed by the hospital's autoclave.

I've heard from thousands of WVians who want an internet that is free of content-based discrimination &amp; support increased reliable, affordable internet access throughout our state.Today we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of our nation’s most influential &amp; inspiring leaders of all time. As we remember his life &amp; his legacy today, I want to remind all West Virginians that we are all capable of making a difference. #MLKDayThis morning I joined @jdickerson on @FaceTheNation to discuss the bipartisan negotiations on immigration, border security and my commitment to reauthorizing funding for #CHIP https://t.co/g1rYd0twP2This evening I spoke at the #WV Fairs and Festivals Association annual convention.

I'm not going to sit idly by while millions of Americans continue to die. As a nation, we cannot accept this anymore.We need to commit to passing my legislation, the LifeBOAT Act, which would creating a permanent funding stream by placing a one cent fee on every milligram of opioid produced. This would bring in about $2 billion a year. https://t.co/uP1A84oF2pIf we are serious about fixing this problem, we need targeted emergency funding to save lives now &amp; permanent funding for treatment centers that can save lives tomorrow.For too long, we have focused on Band-Aid solutions as this crisis has compounded into too many societal issues to count.But despite the impacts we continue to do far too little to stop it. What we are doing is not working. It is clear we must double, triple or quadruple our efforts.We all know about the trauma our neighbors, families &amp; friends have endured as a result of this epidemic. We know about the strain it has put on our communities.Despite my best efforts to work with Congressional leadership &amp; 2 administrations for nearly a decade, our country still cannot properly combat an epidemic that is ravaging our nation &amp; that will change every aspect of our society for generations to come.That is a 28% increase from 2015. That is 115 people dying every single day.Today the @CDCgov released a new report on opioid related overdose deaths &amp; it's devastating. 42,249 Americans died from an opioid overdose death in 2016. https://t.co/IX5L6OXu1GI'm pleased @realDonaldTrump has issued an executive order to identify new sources of critical minerals - or rare earth elements - in the US.
