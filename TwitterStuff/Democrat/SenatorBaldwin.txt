Our dairy farmers are facing challenging times. As we mark the end of #JuneDairyMonth, I was proud to vote for a bipartisan #FarmBill18 that supports Wisconsin farmers so they can boost our rural economy.  https://t.co/IXAPVOPYdzGreat to be in Cadott today with @SenJeffMerkley talking to dairy farmers about #FarmBill18. I was proud to work to secure improved risk management tools to support our dairy farmers and boost our ag economy. https://t.co/S7vRjRKBnRRecent flooding severely damaged roads, bridges &amp; infrastructure in northern Wisconsin, threatening Wisconsinites‚Äô ability to get to work, get their goods to market &amp; keep our economy moving.

That is why I was honored to receive the 2018 Outstanding Congressional Leadership Award from @UnitedSpinal. Thank you for your advocacy! https://t.co/xfhwCk4o4pToday I was proud to vote for the bipartisan #FarmBill18 that does right by our Wisconsin farmers. I‚Äôve worked for strong investments &amp; reforms in this legislation to support our hardworking farmers, and ensure they have the tools to be successful and move our state #Forward.The tragedy at the #CapitalGazette in Annapolis is heartbreaking. As we mourn the victims and thank our first responders, let us find the will to take action on gun violence so we can start saving lives.SEC must revisit its rules around stock buybacks to ensure that corporate executives are not boosting the sales of their own stock while ignoring the needs of their companies‚Äô workers. We need an economy that works for workers &amp; not just those at the top. https://t.co/FXUHU7EokwIt‚Äôs just wrong for big corporations to pocket massive, permanent tax breaks and reward the wealth of top executives with more stock buybacks, while giving workers pink slips and outsourcing jobs.

We should #RewardWork, not just wealth.So far this year, corporations have announced more than $480 billion in stock buybacks, overwhelmingly benefiting top executives and wealthy shareholders, and leaving middle class workers behind.I‚Äôm calling on SEC Chairman Clayton to open a public comment period to review the SEC‚Äôs current rules around stock buybacks, which haven‚Äôt been updated in over a decade. https://t.co/2k0cQQ0yAcMy statement in response to the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. https://t.co/U2oWDvmy7UI‚Äôm working to pass the bipartisan Senate #FarmBill18 because we need to make sure Washington is working for Wisconsin farmers. https://t.co/54DCtKY8nm@NBCNews ‚ÄúThe Republican tax reform package that was supposed to raise wages and spur hiring has instead funded a record stock buyback and dividend spree, benefiting investors and company executives over workers.‚Äù https://t.co/DPGCpzFfwz#GOPTaxScam News: ‚ÄúCompanies used Trump's tax cut for record stock buybacks, not wages‚Äù via @nbcnews https://t.co/DPGCpzFfwzCorporate special interests already have too much power in Washington and today #SCOTUS gave them more to make a rigged system worse for working families and a shrinking middle class.

They need a permanent commitment in the final #WRDA bill and he should expect nothing less from @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan.
https://t.co/8bn1ZC7w1yThe #SCOTUS decision doesn't make the #TravelBan right. In fact it's wrong. America has been, and should be, better than this.I support better trade deals, not trade wars. Tariffs against our trading partners in Europe do not fix our trade problems, and President Trump's haphazard approach on tariffs with our allies will hurt Wisconsin‚Äôs manufacturing and agriculture economy.
https://t.co/oRoPyPcwhNI‚Äôm proud to introduce legislation to expand resources for our dairy businesses to foster innovation, so Wisconsin farmers, cheesemakers and dairy processors can continue moving #AmericasDairyland forward.
https://t.co/FluKXwFtybMore sabotage from the Trump Admin. They have failed to announce funding to support health insurance navigators, who are critical to helping families find quality, affordable health coverage. We should be making it easier for Wisconsinites to get the care they need, not harder. https://t.co/tlhxg3TbW5I am working for our dairy businesses so they can foster innovation, reach new markets and move Wisconsin‚Äôs dairy economy forward.
https://t.co/7UN4Q2upHRThank you to SEC Commissioner Jackson for speaking out on corporate stock buybacks.

I‚Äôm standing with the National Milk Producers Federation (@NMPS) to give farmers the tools they need to succeed. https://t.co/RajqvoIj1pMy legislation will help dairy businesses reach new markets and add value to their products.

She is the 2018 Congressional Award Gold Medalist and member of the first ever STEM Stars class! 

Nikhita, you are making Wisconsin proud! #WomeninSTEM https://t.co/rreq5dyoFfWe need to rewrite the rules of our economy by reining in corporate stock buybacks, giving workers a seat at the table and rewarding hard work instead of just wealth. https://t.co/JjTIpH7LHZThe opioid crisis is not a partisan issue, and a strong partnership between the federal government and Wisconsin is essential to an effective response. Proud to work in the Senate to make sure Wisconsin has the tools needed to combat this epidemic. https://t.co/qYngy4Ei2qThis week the fantastic advocates from @alzassociation stopped by my office in D.C.

Today, Wisconsin is eligible for $11.8 million in new federal funding for local prevention, treatment &amp; recovery efforts.
https://t.co/W97lqsTHeBMore health care sabotage from the Trump Administration. These plans undermine the guaranteed health care protections in the ACA and could make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to find quality, affordable health coverage. #ProtectOurCare 
https://t.co/RmSvK7JnnWToday we observe #Juneteenth Independence Day. Although we have made tremendous progress, the march for full equality must continue. Today let us join together as one community, inspired by those who came before us, and recommit ourselves to move America #Forward.We cannot allow children to be used as political pawns by the Trump Administration. I cosponsored the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to end this Trump policy. Every Democrat in the Senate supports it. If Republicans oppose children being taken from their parents, they should too.Tearing families apart and traumatizing children is wrong and immoral. There is no law requiring the separation of families and this inhumane Trump Administration policy could and should end today. https://t.co/wD4hHa9D5KI‚Äôve met with farmers across Wisconsin, heard the challenges they face &amp; know what support they need. I‚Äôm bringing those concerns to the Senate to make sure Washington is working for Wisconsin farmers with the Senate #FarmBill https://t.co/Db9KGEw9kzHeavy rains caused flooding and flash floods in Northern Wisconsin.

I‚Äôm disappointed #SCOTUS punted on hyper partisan #gerrymandering.Health experts agree. Allowing insurance companies to sell junk plans could lead to weaker coverage &amp; higher premiums, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. I‚Äôm calling on the Trump Admin to stop this policy &amp; protect people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/It1CqPjkkMDuring #ImmigrantHeritageMonth let us remember that we are a nation of immigrants because America has always been a land of opportunity. That is the promise of the United States and we all need to make sure we keep it. https://t.co/4HVtoAaElKThank you to Former First Lady @laurawbush for saying what needs to be said.

Thanks to the Wisconsin Electric Cooperatives Association‚Äôs National Youth Tour for the visit! https://t.co/T8gahB4jnKThis confirms what we knew all along. The #GOPTaxScam was about giving big corporations and the top 1% massive tax breaks, while leaving hardworking, middle class Americans behind.
https://t.co/JyJqWbOu6fI‚Äôve seen how public-private partnerships can best address the workforce readiness challenges we face in Wisconsin. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm introducing the #PARTNERSAct to boost apprenticeship programs &amp; give more people the skills they need to succeed. https://t.co/lWKLn1pUfCWe must #ActOnClimate before it‚Äôs too late.

https://t.co/7PSgGuyrjjBig banks got massive, permanent tax breaks from the #GOPTaxScam.

Fifty-three others were wounded, and many more carry emotional scars to this day.

Wells Fargo got a $3.4 billion #GOPTaxScam boost, announced $22.6 billion in stock buybacks, and gave 46 Wisconsin workers pink slips. Here is my letter to Wells Fargo letting them know what I think about it. https://t.co/9jhMLRejsmWe should rebuild our water infrastructure with American workers and American products.

https://t.co/KjNbxBP57YCorporations have announced $470 BILLION in stock buybacks this yr, overwhelmingly benefiting top execs &amp; wealthy shareholders, leaving workers behind. We need to rewrite the rules of our economy to rein in buybacks and give back to hardworking families.

Proud to have worked across party lines on VA reforms to ensure our nation‚Äôs veterans get the care they need. https://t.co/mm50njLPYVWashington needs to step up and be a stronger partner in the fight against this epidemic and support our local communities with the tools they need to save lives.I‚Äôve worked for bipartisan reforms to prevent the flow of illegal fentanyl &amp; opioids from other countries, support first responders with lifesaving naloxone, invest in local prevention, treatment and recovery efforts, and provide more resources for a growing meth problem.I‚Äôm in Superior today to meet with law enforcement, first responders, health officials and community leaders about the opioid epidemic that is devastating communities in Wisconsin. https://t.co/nTGHG3dYusI‚Äôm so proud to see this monument become a reality at long last for Vietnam helicopter pilots and crewmembers so we can honor their sacrifice and remember their courage for generations to come. https://t.co/ruXLrQfVJoI‚Äôm working to protect Wisconsin organic farmers from fraudulent, foreign imports. https://t.co/M851U4gjdtI‚Äôve introduced the bipartisan SIREN Act to reauthorize funding that directly supports rural first responders in training and recruiting staff and purchasing equipment, including naloxone, needed to reduce opioid overdose-related deaths. https://t.co/CZ4Elba45DRural communities have been hit hard by the opioid epidemic and no first responder should be unable to save a life because they don‚Äôt have what they need. That's why I have worked to make naloxone and other critical resources more accessible and affordable.I am working to level the playing field for #WI farmers so they can continue to move our state forward. Thank you @OrganicTrade for your partnership and for supporting my Organic Farmer and Consumer Protection Act! https://t.co/MVwRMKkF7cWhile the spring semester just ended, @UWMadison Chancellor Rebecca Blank is still working hard on behalf of #WI students and researchers. Thank you for your advocacy and for your visit! #OnWisconsin https://t.co/4IsJysIKd3I worked across party lines on reforms to improve opioid therapy and pain care for Wisconsin Veterans at community care facilities outside the VA, including through the VA Choice program. Today the Senate passed my bipartisan legislation. https://t.co/BtZVA0oUVTIn 2016 my legislation was signed into law to strengthen opioid prescribing guidelines at VA facilities and put in place stronger oversight and accountability. Today we take the next step &amp; give every veteran access to the same safe care, regardless of where they seek services.@UNITEDWEDREAM #Dreamers, right now you can still apply to renew your #DACA. If you meet the requirements to apply for DACA renewal, you should apply ‚Üí https://t.co/nV8JrlIAMe https://t.co/vPNmXmQslUFind out if you can renew your #DACA TODAY! @UnitedWeDream has put a list of resources for you to figure out if you qualify to renew. #HereToStay Visit https://t.co/Sb9X84hFQl@USDA Wisconsin organic farmers move our #MadeinWI economy forward and I‚Äôm doing right by them and #WIag.Organic farmers work hard so products meet the strict requirements of @USDA organic standard. All organic products sold in U.S. should meet the same standards. We must strengthen @USDA oversight of organic products to prevent fraud &amp; ensure foreign imports play by the same rules.Wisconsin is home to the 2nd largest number of organic farms in the country &amp; they are a strong driver of our agricultural economy. That's why I introduced a reform today to combat imports of fraudulent organic products that undercut our American farmers. https://t.co/Eg1XVLQiZ3Every woman, regardless of where she lives, deserves the freedom to make her own, personal decisions about her health care, her family and her body. #NoGagRule #IStandWithPP https://t.co/lQ8xOa8PqLWisconsin‚Äôs maritime industry supports our workers and enhances our national security. I am proud to strongly support our shipbuilders and manufacturers, including @ShipbuildersUSA. Thank you for the Maritime Leadership Award and for your great partnership! #NationalMaritimeDay https://t.co/H0cmhOnU8OI was pleased to discuss fair trade and other important topics with @SwissEmbassyUSA, #Swiss Senate President #KarinKellerSutter and the rest of the Swiss delegation today before they head to the Swiss Center of North America in New Glarus! https://t.co/4zfu68z0CSThanks to @SenatorHeitkamp for her bipartisan leadership calling on @FCC to increase the funding cap for a program aimed at improving the quality of health care available to patients in rural America. https://t.co/eueom94Dth https://t.co/szJnLNqP8w.@CFPB was built to empower consumers. A transparent complaint database creates the right incentives for financial institutions to follow the rules &amp; treat consumers fairly. We must protect this database. https://t.co/9qplPr0sEJMick Mulvaney has told bankers he wants to shut down the important consumer protection tool that allows you to file public complaints, resolve issues and make informed decisions when using financial services. I'm urging @CFPB to preserve public access to this database.Now it‚Äôs important that the House make the same long-term commitment to American workers with a permanent #BuyAmerica standard for water infrastructure projects.
https://t.co/sbA3ZTruA0I have earned the support of @POTUS for my #BuyAmerica reform and I worked to make sure it is included once again in the Senate's bipartisan water infrastructure legislation. 
https://t.co/sohsh5TyPSI strongly believe American workers should build our infrastructure with American products, and that taxpayers' money should not be spent to support foreign workers. My #BuyAmerica reform requires that all iron and steel used in new water infrastructure projects be American-made.We need to put Wisconsin manufacturers to work rebuilding our nation‚Äôs crumbling water infrastructure and they deserve a solid, long-term #BuyAmerica commitment from Washington that rewards their hard work. https://t.co/sbA3ZTruA0Proud to work on bipartisan effort with @SenAmyKlobuchar &amp; @SenatorCapito to provide greater public awareness about eating disorders and help health care professionals &amp; school personnel better recognize behaviors that may lead to an eating disorder. https://t.co/oPbCnjoCFKTrump‚Äôs budget cut funding for #GreatLakes, so I worked to secure full funding for Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Proud to announce we're bringing a $1.6 million #GLRI grant back to Wisconsin to protect our Lake Michigan shoreline. More to come, but important step #Forward!I worked across party lines to help move this memorial forward and I am so proud to have worked with Bob to make this a reality. The brave heroes who served as helicopter pilots and crewmembers during the Vietnam War have earned this recognition. https://t.co/CfwxcnlahLAt a time when many high school grads gear up for college or tech school next year, and as this year‚Äôs graduates move on to the workforce, let‚Äôs recommit to making sure higher education is a path to prosperity, not a path into suffocating debt. https://t.co/G0gXoEUerBThis week, I went to the Senate floor to call for action to do right by tens of thousands of Wisconsin workers and retirees who are facing massive cuts to the pensions they earned. https://t.co/TmDggcZCUlI have introduced the #FairCareAct to safeguard current protections for those with pre-existing conditions and help prevent further premium increases and insurance market instability caused by the Trump sabotage of our health care system. https://t.co/RGqWGTQDFZAs someone who was branded as a child with the words, ‚Äòpre-existing condition,‚Äô I want to make sure that no parent, foster parent or grandparent has to choose between helping their child get better or going bankrupt. My #FairCareAct takes on #JunkPlans. https://t.co/AZGPzoEHc2Expanding the sale and marketing of #JunkPlans could exclude basic benefits including hospitalization, prescription drugs, mental health services, substance abuse treatment and maternity care. https://t.co/dmUfCJgp1uIf the Trump Admin allows insurance companies to once again sell #JunkPlans, premiums will rise for older Americans and millions of people living with pre-existing conditions will have their guaranteed protections threatened and face higher costs. https://t.co/VeLt10c1myI'm heartbroken again. 
Another tragic school shooting with more lives lost.
Congress has a responsibility to address gun violence like the public health crisis that it is.
I am once again calling on all of us to step up, work together and meet this responsibility.Today I met with Gina Haspel and here is my full statement on her nomination for CIA Director https://t.co/7ZJSP2sGCeI questioned the Trump administration about doing more to stop the flow of illicit opioids, fentanyl, and meth from other countries. My bipartisan legislation passed out of committee to provide them more tools to stop the flow. Let's move it forward. https://t.co/Av9TXkDs5tI agree with the workers from Case in Racine: We need to pass a #FarmBill that works for our Wisconsin farmers and supports our manufacturing economy. Thank you for visiting with me today and for your hard work moving Wisconsin forward. https://t.co/A2I1K4NxsQBig news! The Senate just voted to restore #NetNeutrality! 

Now the House needs to take action because innovators, entrepreneurs, small businesses &amp; consumers should have a #FreeandOpenInternet.They don‚Äôt call us cheeseheads for nothing. Wisconsin has a long and proud tradition that I am working to protect. 
https://t.co/mcoxRO6thmOn #PoliceWeek2018 and every week, I‚Äôm proud to stand up for the worker rights of our police officers and all public safety workers. https://t.co/apVrtzHNYfTODAY, I‚Äôm voting to #SavetheInternet, ensuring that the internet does not become a two-tiered system, with fast lanes for those who can afford it and slow lanes for those who can‚Äôt. #NetNeutrality is a principle that is at the heart of a #FreeandOpenInternet. https://t.co/9h6rDBmbjEAs the Trump Admin renegotiates #NAFTA I have led a bipartisan effort to fight back against any proposal that creates an uneven playing field for our Wisconsin cheesemakers to compete &amp; keep winning. They move our #MadeInWI economy forward &amp; I'm standing up for Wisconsin cheese. https://t.co/LWoqo7nkFnTOMORROW ‚Äì I will be voting to #SavetheInternet and restore #NetNeutrality because we must protect American innovators and entrepreneurs and keep the internet free and open for all. https://t.co/C0j0qJ0TSnGo @Giannis_An34! #FearTheDeer #DunkOfTheYearüèÜ https://t.co/6vQWnGHNfJThese McNair Scholars from @MarquetteU are working hard on their research projects and I am inspired by their passion for building a better future. Many thanks for the visit today! https://t.co/8RhayCmur4If Washington does not act, we will be breaking a promise made to 1.5 million workers and retirees nationwide.  Our pension promises must be kept, and we need to do it now.Randall from Suamico, a retired truck driver, and his wife deserve a secure retirement, not to worry about the possibility of losing their pension. We need to act now. https://t.co/pIFsZOm3gMMichael from De Pere, a Vietnam Veteran, and his wife are at an age where finding a new job is simply not an option. They both worked long hours throughout their lives and deserve to have their pension promises kept. https://t.co/WzkiSf70nEDiane and her husband from Luxemburg paid into a pension expecting to have a comfortable life in retirement‚Äîand now it‚Äôs at risk of being lost. https://t.co/sJSb4CuENsThis is about a promise made to Gary from Marshfield who needs his pension to support his growing family. #SaveOurPensions https://t.co/oKV4hIhWiHRight now, 25,000 #WI workers and retirees have their pensions threatened through no fault of their own. Congress needs to act, keep our promise and fix failing pensions so retirees can count on the pensions they have earned and workers can count on their pensions in the future.I‚Äôm headed to the Senate floor to join @SenDonnelly, @SenAmyKlobuchar, @Sen_JoeManchin, @SenatorHeitkamp, @SenBobCasey, and @SenGaryPeters because we are working to do right by the workers and retirees who are facing massive cuts to the pensions. Tune in: https://t.co/qIMBec4zLhOur police officers, firefighters and EMS workers keep us safe, protect our neighborhoods and create safer communities for all. They deserve the right to form and join unions and the right to collectively bargain. So I introduced new legislation today to do right by them. https://t.co/08XvTGmHr5Today I‚Äôm proud to introduce the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act to protect worker rights for our police officers, firefighters and EMS workers. https://t.co/oaHzOMu7GdThe agreement between the EU and Mexico threatens not only the names of common state products, but also key drivers of our #WI economy. Mexico must reject any proposal that limits our businesses‚Äô ability to export and compete. I‚Äôm standing up for our #MadeInWI cheesemakers. https://t.co/KvOgqlQoBM@SenToomey Wisconsin cheese making is vital to our state‚Äôs economy and our heritage, which is why I am fighting back against any trade proposal that creates an uneven playing field for our Wisconsin businesses to compete. https://t.co/rTBhZdZ4gLI have led a bipartisan effort with @SenToomey calling on the Trump Administration to protect American dairy &amp; cheese from European trade initiatives that would require producers to change the names of cheeses they‚Äôve made for generations. https://t.co/Fi93no0tMWAmerican workers have suffered for decades at the hands of China‚Äôs cheating. President Trump should be fighting to keep American jobs here instead of helping save jobs at a Chinese company that violated U.S. laws by exporting to North Korea and Iran. https://t.co/Q6geq8AcFuJohn McCain is an American hero whose life‚Äôs work is driven by principle and patriotism. His public service to our country deserves respect and I stand with my Senate colleagues who support him and his family during this challenging time.Thank you to my friends at @MidDayWomen for your advocacy on behalf of women in the Fox Cities region. Together, we are building a new class of strong women leaders in #WI. https://t.co/1egVMljo4TExpanding #JunkPlans, cutting funds to help Americans #GetCovered &amp; driving up premiums, undermining guaranteed protections for people with pre-existing conditions &amp; putting insurance companies back in charge; it‚Äôs all part of the Republican sabotage of our health care system. https://t.co/mKDLmnomlII‚Äôm supporting bipartisan legislation introduced by @SenTinaSmith and @SenThomTillis to support health care benefits for ‚ÄúAtomic Veterans‚Äù who were exposed to harmful radiation. These veterans have waited far too long for this recognition. https://t.co/7m84o76FlQHere's a great write up on Wisconsin‚Äôs ‚ÄúMother of the Year.‚Äù It was so nice to meet Brenda Arens Reed when she came to DC for a visit! https://t.co/TAApoeVrZZI'd like to welcome Wisconsin law enforcement to our nation's capital for #PoliceWeek2018.

Thank you for all you do! https://t.co/V6Ht7QC3n7Medicare should be allowed to negotiate lower drug prices, saving consumers and taxpayers money. It‚Äôs disappointing @POTUS is walking away from his promise to make that happen.  https://t.co/jEw5FT8s7CYesterday, I asked @SecAzar to crack down on #BigPharma jacking up their prices, making it harder for families to afford life-saving medicine. https://t.co/1TyrM5d1Oo.@MercuryMarine is a great #MadeInWI business that is a leader promoting #STEM education in Fond du Lac.

Thank you to the students and educators who visited with me this week! #MPSProud https://t.co/PPLwRrP0aFThis is about taking on a rigged system and fighting for accountability and fairness. Drug corporations have a lot of power in Washington, but I don‚Äôt work for them. I work for the people of Wisconsin. It‚Äôs time someone stood up for them. https://t.co/3ziqlYKZBgBig drug corporations keep jacking up the cost of medicine families need so I‚Äôm joining @SenAmyKlobuchar and @SenBlumenthal to tell NextSource Pharmaceutical that they need to lower the price of a life-saving drug that has become unaffordable for people fighting cancer. https://t.co/iupunj3TQlThe JUST Act was signed into law! So proud we are taking a critical step toward justice for Holocaust survivors &amp; the families of victims. Thanks @realDonaldTrump @SenRubioPress and all our partners in this bipartisan effort. https://t.co/JZ3fuEEAz6Drug corporations are sticking it to American taxpayers with prescription drug price hikes. My bipartisan reform with @SenJohnMcCain will require accountability &amp; transparency for drug corporations who are jacking up costs for families in need of affordable lifesaving treatments.Since President Trump took office in January 2017, the prices of over 2,500 drugs have increased by at least double digits and almost 40 have increased by triple digits or more. Drug corporations got massive tax breaks and the cost of medicine continues to rise for families. https://t.co/cvVIAGCU1GWashington needs to take action to stop skyrocketing prescription drug prices. I have offered a bipartisan solution with @SenJohnMcCain to hold #BigPharma accountable. 
@POTUS must step up and support our FAIR Drug Pricing Act. https://t.co/4TEyChCo0HI am proud to stand with #ActForWomen because every woman, regardless of where she lives, deserves the freedom to make her own decisions about her health care, her family and her body.

Now the Trump admin sabotage is raising health care costs &amp; increasing the number of uninsured. Instead of making things worse, we should be working to lower costs &amp; improve care. #ProtectOurCare
https://t.co/x7iMslmvgsToo many rural communities in Wisconsin don‚Äôt have access to maternity care.

More needs to be done to strengthen our #WI farm industry so we can better support Wisconsin‚Äôs rural communities and agriculture economy.Farmers need solid roads and bridges to transport their crops and products from the farm to consumers and businesses. It‚Äôs time to reinvest in rebuilding our infrastructure and enhancing transportation throughout #WI.Washington needs to take more steps to provide support for farmers targeted by retaliatory tariffs, address unfair dairy pricing schemes and ensure Wisconsin farmers have the tools they need to be successful.Wisconsin‚Äôs dairy farmers are facing a challenging year. I am proud that we acted swiftly by securing major investments and the necessary resources to support our dairy industry, including more than $1 billion in dairy safety net tools.Peter, Carmen and Shane agree: Our Wisconsin farm industry is a key driver of our state‚Äôs agricultural economy and a core part of our rural communities.

President Trump &amp; Republicans are still trying to take health care away, eliminate guaranteed protections and drive up premiums for those who rely on quality, affordable health care.One year ago today, House Republicans voted for a health care repeal bill that would have cut coverage, increased costs and eliminated protections for millions of Americans.

Proud to work on bipartisan legislation that will help address the CTE teacher shortage by taking action to recruit and train high-quality teachers. https://t.co/HGBDXQZwODJoin me in raising awareness around this year‚Äôs #DenimDayMKE. Together, let's stand with survivors and work to end sexual violence. #MeTooMKE https://t.co/Qu6EkKMVLcPrincipal Bianchi of the #MKE French Immersion School and I just attended French President @EmmanuelMacron‚Äôs Joint Address to Congress. It was great hearing from one of our nation‚Äôs closest allies &amp; glad to have one of Wisconsin‚Äôs outstanding educators with me for the event! https://t.co/ze8MqHavrUI know @US_FDA has the authority to enforce its own existing rules so they should do it and get the job done for our Wisconsin dairy farmers. #DairyPride https://t.co/emdsWTInbWOur dairy farmers are in crisis. Yesterday, I pressed @US_FDA Commissioner Gottlieb on the need for action and fairness for our dairy farmers and processors. We must help our rural communities and grow Wisconsin‚Äôs agriculture economy. https://t.co/Tg8txYQoz3I applaud Congress for supporting this bipartisan effort to take a critical step toward justice, at long last, for Holocaust survivors and the families of Holocaust victims. I look forward to seeing this bipartisan legislation signed into law by the President as soon as possible. https://t.co/iSAP8hAzIrCongrats to Brenda Reed, Wisconsin‚Äôs 2018 #MotherOfTheYear! Thank you for all your hard work in serving our greater Wisconsin community! https://t.co/DkSmuBbbaa https://t.co/a4WRALK3adThis crisis is not going away, and we need to keep working in a bipartisan way on solutions that provide local communities with the tools they need to save lives.The final Opioid Response Act of 2018 includes key provisions of mine to stop the flow of fentanyl into this country &amp; strengthen state grant programs to give Wisconsin greater flexibility to fight opioid abuse and other illicit drugs like meth. https://t.co/WPkbdMJOTaToday the HELP Committee moved forward with bipartisan reforms to step up our response to the nationwide opioid epidemic and to support local prevention, treatment and recovery efforts in Wisconsin and across the country.I‚Äôm working to make sure there are better protections from toxic chemicals in cosmetic products. Thanks @KourtneyKardash and @ewg for your advocacy and for bringing awareness to #BeautyMadeBetter https://t.co/BofiiovJQUStrong #BuyAmerican standards drive economic growth &amp; create good jobs to support hardworking families. In Wisconsin we make a lot things used to build our nation‚Äôs ships and vessels. Taxpayer money should not be spent on foreign products when we can buy #MadeinWI products.Today I‚Äôm introducing the Made in America Shipbuilding Act to strengthen our shipbuilding &amp; manufacturing industries because I believe when we are using taxpayer dollars to build our ships, America should buy made in the USA products. https://t.co/dLbrJJPlm1My statement on the Pompeo nomination for Secretary of State: https://t.co/0mJIWzVXbHAccording to @KaiserFamFound, in Milwaukee a majority of short-term junk insurance plans don‚Äôt include prescription drug coverage ‚Äì meaning you could have to pay out of pocket for the medicine you need. That‚Äôs not right. https://t.co/l6MCiVJiOS@POTUS Today is the deadline to make your voice heard and tell the Trump Administration to protect quality health care coverage for Americans, and not turn back the clock on guaranteed protections for people with pre-existing conditions.I‚Äôm calling on @POTUS to stop the expansion of junk health care plans that would raise premiums for older Americans and harm millions of people living with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/21CEUfk7fPI‚Äôve worked to make sure no parent has to choose between helping a child w/a pre-existing condition get better or going bankrupt. Junk health care plans make it easier for insurers to stop covering pre-existing conditions. We need to ensure families have guaranteed protections.Proud to help secure a federal investment to improve the Wisconsin Veterans Home at King. https://t.co/ZZUYKuu9N4Rural communities across Wisconsin face challenges with infrastructure, broadband and creating economic opportunity. I am proud that we were able to reverse proposed cuts and provide strong funding for the key tools our rural communities and small towns. https://t.co/cIzYCryXbIFrom farmland to the Great Lakes‚Ää, Wisconsin boasts a proud tradition of being a national leader on environmental preservation and conservation protections. Now more than ever, we must recommit ourselves to pass on a world better than we found it. Happy #EarthDay, Wisconsin! https://t.co/QZVVb4pG7vFarmers are the backbone of our rural economy and leaders in our rural communities. Thank you to Patty Edelburg of @NFUDC for joining me to discuss the upcoming Farm Bill and ways to continuing supporting our Wisconsin farmers! https://t.co/HRzlypivNzThank you to Stephen Gauger and the @MilitaryOfficer for meeting with me this week to discuss how we can improve our support for military retirees. https://t.co/KQbRoPuSVFWith more than 9,000 craft laborers in Wisconsin, @WILaborers have been steadfast in ensuring workers and their families receive fair wages and benefits. Happy to stand with you in this effort! https://t.co/2bvbQVu21BI'm proud of my partnership with @JCCMilwaukee and their efforts in educating our youth and building stronger communities throughout Milwaukee. Thank you @mshapiro414 for your leadership and advocacy on behalf of Wisconsin‚Äôs Jewish community. https://t.co/sDpJvyaQxb‚ÄúFarmers First legislation boon for struggling farmers‚Äù https://t.co/yvHjLZvFNjNaloxone can save lives. I‚Äôm calling on @HHSGov to take action to reduce the cost of this life-saving opioid overdose reversal drug. No police officer, firefighter, public health provider or person should be unable to save a life because of the high price. https://t.co/gzIxLHvSzDIn recent years, @ForestService funds have been regularly diverted from Wisconsin forests to fight wildfires out west. That means delaying important projects in Chequamegon-Nicolet and other forests. I worked to end ‚Äúfire borrowing‚Äù and keep those funds in Wisconsin https://t.co/Ec910fBuPIHistoric moment! So wonderful to welcome Maile on the Senate floor today. Glad to have you back, @SenDuckworth! https://t.co/VSzrUmG2tVI‚Äôm working to protect our #GreatLakes https://t.co/W9cA99OsxMThanks to @SenJoniErnst @SenatorHeitkamp @JerryMoran @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner for joining me in this important effort to stand up for our farmers and make sure they have the support they need.The #FarmersFirst Act provides funding for local resources to expand access to stress reduction strategies and suicide prevention programs to help tackle this problem and save lives.Our nation‚Äôs farmers are the backbone of our rural economy. But Washington has been slow to recognize the challenges farmers face &amp; daily stressors during difficult years. Today we‚Äôre introducing bipartisan reform that puts #FarmersFirst. https://t.co/Ucr3RxG6uTAlways great to connect with students from Wisconsin visiting Capitol Hill. Thanks to Kiel High School and Madison‚Äôs Eagle School for saying hello! https://t.co/BrQC0xTAcORolling back clean water protections could increase the spread of invasive species in Great Lakes, harming the entire region. I‚Äôm proud of my vote to stand w/our Great Lakes. Let‚Äôs find a solution that supports our Coast Guard, protects Great Lakes &amp; helps our coastal economy. https://t.co/ve5WYPt3MnThe brave individuals who served as helicopter pilots and crewmembers during the Vietnam War and their families have earned this recognition and I was so proud to lend my support and help it become a reality. https://t.co/iwIudkshEkI was honored to be at Arlington National Cemetery today for the dedication of the Vietnam Helicopter Pilot and Crewmember Monument. It was a beautiful day to honor the outstanding service and courageous sacrifice of those who served. https://t.co/JgBbDsmjZEToday is Wisconsin's first annual I Am For the Child Day! I‚Äôm so proud to work with @wisconsincasa and help raise awareness for child abuse prevention. Thank you for all of the great work you do! üíôhttps://t.co/m0urCloMYl https://t.co/nLMfntEvr9Barbara Bush served our nation with honor and grace as First Lady and she was a champion of literacy. I join with our country in offering my gratitude for her life of public service, and my deepest condolences to the Bush Family.What Morris is describing is called the carried interest loophole. It allows wealthy hedge fund managers to pay lower tax rates than workers making the same income. During the tax debate I proposed an amendment to close this unfair loophole. Not one Republican voted for it. https://t.co/C3wWeLAvJFThe #GOPTaxScam was a massive giveaway to the wealthiest few. It‚Äôs just wrong for big corporations to pocket huge, permanent tax cuts &amp; reward wealthy top executives with more stock buybacks, while leaving middle class American workers behind. https://t.co/vtbtPEwQocWe must do more to break down barriers &amp; advance biomedical research. By investing in young scientists, we can better pursue medical breakthroughs, life-saving treatments and cures. Proud to keep working to move this bipartisan effort forward.
https://t.co/pWmFVbVLsqBoko Haram remains a threat to innocent civilians in Nigeria, to regional security &amp; U.S. national interests. I introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning Boko Haram and calling on the U.S. govt to work with Nigeria to defeat this terrorist group. https://t.co/FAXRbSaHNqWe need to take on powerful drug companies and rising prescription drug prices. I have bipartisan legislation to do it so we can help lower the cost of the medicine families depend on. https://t.co/ixjmOlRZLBThanks @SRuhle for talking stock buybacks this morning &amp; the false promise of the #GOPTaxScam. Billions in buybacks that overwhelmingly benefit corporate executives and shareholders, not workers. https://t.co/j23IvB8DKsI‚Äôm calling on Trump Admin to take more steps to support Wisconsin farmers targeted by China‚Äôs tariffs. We also need @POTUS to address Canada‚Äôs unfair dairy pricing scheme &amp; ensure our farmers have tools they need to succeed &amp; boost our rural economy. 
https://t.co/hcBkUfRhahMy statement on military operations in Syria: https://t.co/unDccDosoN.Taiko Drumming Team of @MadisonWestHS will be making Wisconsin proud this weekend as they are performing at the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade.

This week it was a pleasure meeting with students visiting Washington! https://t.co/gBDZNm5j28Wisconsin wants Washington to act by taking on powerful drug companies and rising prescription drug prices. https://t.co/YPhOzwPI4ZThere is also bipartisan support for the #CREATESAct, which provides a better deal on prescription drug costs for families by preventing #BigPharma from blocking less expensive generic alternatives for consumers. We need to #PassCREATES. https://t.co/cwapqIeS1yI introduced the FAIR Drug Pricing Act with @SenJohnMcCain that would take the first step to crack down on drug companies that increase prescription drug prices by holding the pharmaceutical industry accountable and instituting basic transparency. https://t.co/4TEyChkN99I was in Appleton today to discuss my bipartisan solutions to address skyrocketing prescription drugs prices. https://t.co/eHpKA4tVXnThe #GOPTaxScam gave permanent tax cuts to drug corporations, but now they are spending it on stock buybacks and hiking the price of medicine for families. https://t.co/1VRoDQwxA6Nothing reveals the false promise of trickle-down economics more than this: corporations are using tax breaks from #GOPTaxScam on stock buybacks for wealthy CEOs and leaving workers behind. That‚Äôs not right. It‚Äôs time to #RewardWork, not just wealth. https://t.co/uPVMSFwTM5In communities across Wisconsin, @UWEXCoopExt is connecting people and families with educational and training opportunities that make their lives better. Thank you for your visit yesterday! https://t.co/U9XvPfP9vfOn Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the 6 million Jews who were murdered &amp; keep survivors and families of victims in our thoughts.

Our work is not done. The House must pass the JUST Act so we can move toward justice for Holocaust survivors &amp; families of victims. #NeverAgainU.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin to President Trump: Stop Censoring Critical LGBT Health Information and Resources on Federal Websites https://t.co/afVfqm3c3QWe have a shared goal of supporting the Littoral Combat Ship program, which is critical to our national security and Wisconsin‚Äôs shipbuilding economy. That‚Äôs why I will continue to fight for the LCS. Thank you for having me at the LCS Supplier Conference and Hill Day today! https://t.co/mUSxB9YiksThe opioid crisis isn‚Äôt going away. We must do everything we can to make sure our health and law enforcement officials have the tools they need to support prevention &amp; treatment, and have the flexibility to also combat the growing use of other drugs like fentanyl and meth. https://t.co/rXypqXg7s9We must do more to address China‚Äôs unfair trade policies and support our Wisconsin paper manufacturers. Thank you to the #WI Paper Council for continuing to advocate for our proud #MadeInWI paper industry. https://t.co/ZST99E6ykNIn just a few minutes, I‚Äôll be joining @ChrisVanHollen @SenBooker to discuss how we need to rewrite the rules of our economy to #RewardWork, not just wealth. Tune in: https://t.co/YxKSw0iPzb.Congress must continue this important work and get answers from Cambridge Analytica because Facebook users don‚Äôt know what they did with their personal info or who it was shared with. https://t.co/r6tnrFmQqOGrateful for the opportunity to meet with the Wisconsin Electric Cooperative Assoc. &amp; National Council of Farmers Cooperatives Wisconsin yesterday! Thank you for your advocacy as we work to make sure the 2018 Farm Bill includes priorities to support our rural economy. https://t.co/3K4FQg1YQfTune in today at 5PM ET/4PM CT! @ChrisVanHollen @SenBooker and I will be live on Facebook and Periscope to discuss how we can rein in corporate stock buybacks and start rewarding hard work. #RewardWork https://t.co/WtjN8Ga9QNIn 2018, women are earning $0.80 for every $1.00 a man earns. That‚Äôs not right. On #EqualPayDay, let‚Äôs recommit to working together for paycheck fairness for women in Wisconsin and across the country. https://t.co/17IAkYlICIWe need answers on how Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest personal information of more than 87M users. We also need to hear from Cambridge Analytica because people don‚Äôt know what they did with their personal info or who it was shared with. Congress must find out. https://t.co/XIlLH8neIhAcross America, hardworking women and their families deserve equal pay for equal work. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/STeuTW9cfcWealthy CEOs keep making millions more each year, while worker wages remain stagnant. We need to rewrite the rules of our economy to give workers a seat at the table and reward their hard work.

Cheers! üçª https://t.co/NYKqhUOaWcIn recent years @ForestService funds have been taken from Wisconsin to fight wildfires in the west. I worked across party lines to fix this broken budget borrowing and ensure our funding stays dedicated to managing forest projects in Wisconsin. https://t.co/Jpg3XminDK@voxdotcom ‚ÄúIn March, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) proposed a big idea to try to make the economy fairer: requiring public companies to let their workers directly elect one-third of the corporate board‚Äôs members.‚Äù https://t.co/cFaWGURPiS@voxdotcom We need to rewrite the rules of our economy so it works better for workers and not just those at the top.

We are doing more to help homeless vets, improve health care and invest in rebuilding VA hospitals. https://t.co/rPldqTihbJThe roll back of #CleanerCars standards by @EPAScottPruitt is an attack on science, public health &amp; American innovation. This is a giveaway to Washington lobbyists and big oil special interests that will bring more pollution and higher costs to families. https://t.co/V059WXVJnjThe opioid crisis is not going away, and I will keep working to help local communities with prevention, treatment and recovery efforts to fight opioid and other drug abuse in our state. https://t.co/RT6QAjhJbFDr. King‚Äôs most persistent and urgent question was a simple call to action that we should all answer, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing for others?‚Äù #MLK50Forward https://t.co/inIeKC9KIVAmerican consumers need a watchdog at the @CFPB, not a lap dog. I‚Äôm calling on the agency to stop undermining critical consumer protections and hold predatory lenders accountable and prevent these lending scams from hurting the American people. https://t.co/rT7jQbsBd4Washington needs to step up to help communities like Green Bay fight the opioid epidemic. I‚Äôm proud to work across party lines to secure an additional $3B federal investment to fight this crisis &amp; give local officials the tools they need to save lives. https://t.co/DYphsCktWu https://t.co/wfFAIk7c4JIn Wisconsin, we have a long and proud tradition of being a national leader on issues of our environment. But @EPAScottPruitt‚Äôs roll back of #CleanerCars will cost you money at the pump and could cost your children their health.Thanks to Brown County Executive Streckenbach and all the local officials across our state who are working together to take on the opioid epidemic in Wisconsin. https://t.co/3roDaJxScnMy work is not done taking on this public health crisis and I will continue working to expand and extend funding for the opioid epidemic and help tackle growing methamphetamine abuse in our state. https://t.co/3RMUH2ypQgLocal law enforcement, health providers and the families who face this epidemic every day need action, support and resources.

This new funding will help support the bipartisan opioid safety initiatives and reforms we passed in Jason‚Äôs Law.I worked in a bipartisan way to secure a significant increase in opioid treatment and prevention funding for veterans in the spending bill that was signed by President Trump.Our veterans and their families deserve solutions to problems at the VA and I am proud to have worked across party lines to pass bipartisan VA reform and fully fund the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act. https://t.co/BfTPreTNa3Happy Easter Sunday, Wisconsin!
