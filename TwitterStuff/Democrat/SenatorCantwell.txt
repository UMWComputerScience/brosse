I’m looking forward to joining @MeetThePress tomorrow morning. https://t.co/5nWJOuOgexTHIS SUNDAY: I'm looking forward to talking about immigration and the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy this Sunday with @chucktodd on @MeetThePress. #IfItsSundayLearning to write and read #code is critical to creating and innovating in cyberspace. In high schools, fewer AP exams are taken in #computerscience than any other STEM subject area. While 58% of new STEM jobs are in computing, only 8% of STEM graduates are in computer science.By reducing the costs of establishing #compsci curriculum, the main barrier to entry for high schools to provide quality #coding classes, my legislation will help prepare the next generation of computer scientists to meet the demands of the #hightech workforce.Our #agriculture industry is facing unprecedented barriers as American farmers seek to export their products. Increased funding for well-established export programs is what our #farmers need.In Washington state, only 1,212 students graduated from college with #compsci degrees in 2015, leaving more than 16,200 computing jobs unfilled today. We need to prepare the next generation to meet the demands of the #hightech workforce.Increased foreign competition, along with trade policies that directly harm U.S. agricultural products, puts our #farmers at a disadvantage and at serious risk of losing out in the foreign #agricultural marketplace.Today’s students should be exposed to the computer skills of the 21st Century. By ensuring high school students can access #computerscience and #coding education, we can close the skills gap and boost our country’s competitive position globally.As federal support for @USDA's export programs remains stagnant, foreign competitors are increasing funding for #agricultural export programs to grow their international presence. Increased funding for well-established export programs is what our #farmers desperately need.FACT: The family separation &amp; detention policy adopted by the Trump Administration is not required by U.S. law. Under Section 212 of the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act, @DHSgov is legally allowed to provide #humanitarian parole to asylum seekers awaiting immigration proceedings.In our state &amp; across the nation, our tech industry is booming &amp; creating jobs every day, but curriculum isn't keeping up. By ensuring high school students can access #compsci and #coding education, we can close the skills gap &amp; boost our country’s competitive position globally.As American #agricultural products face increasing competition &amp; barriers to entry in markets around the world, funding for effective agricultural export programs is an important tool for American agriculture to remain competitive &amp; continue its role as a driver of the economy.https://t.co/pV0aW7NtSFhttps://t.co/W6yHODLMckhttps://t.co/5RHo5OmndcI joined @hardball this afternoon to discuss the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy created by Justice Kennedy’s retirement. The most important thing about this whole thing is that President Trump's views are out of the mainstream of the American public.
https://t.co/omCFzEQodgWATCH SOON: I’m joining @HardballChris to discuss the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy created by Justice Kennedy’s retirement. Watch live on @MSNBC. #SCOTUSWe want people with criminal backgrounds to be stopped before they even get into the United States. But we don't want those who are seeking asylum to end up in a detention center, never to be heard from again.#Hanford is a big priority for our state. We need to make sure that clean-up happens, that contractors are accountable, and that our workers are protected.Today I released the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy created by Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement: https://t.co/qPr9jR2JjHI am disappointed with the Court’s decision today, which undermines the ability of public sector workers to bargain collectively and undoes 40 years of established law. #Janus https://t.co/zbX4UmyqZBI've introduced legislation that creates grants for local high schools that allow students to take a #coding class in place of a mathematics, science, or foreign language class in order to fulfill a graduation requirement.The U.S. #agricultural industry is a key economic driver throughout the country. In 2017, agricultural product exports totaled $138 billion in revenue and helped create over 1.1 million jobs.We want due process, we want people to be understood, but people seeking asylum should not be treated the same way as some criminal.

https://t.co/gq52Tnko8zI intend to continue to pursue making sure all our colleagues at the Department of @Energy understand the very terrible idea the Trump Administration is putting forward in trying to sell off assets from the @BonnevillePower Administration and @TVAnews.Oversight of immigrant children separated from their families falls under @HHSGov's Office of Refugee Resettlement, which exists to help assist in the relocation process and provide needed services to individuals granted asylum within the United States.In Washington state, #energy efficiency has delivered over &amp; over again. There's a whole block in @SpokaneCity that plans on being a net zero energy block. I want that economy to move forward in our state and in our nation.Yesterday, I introduced legislation to help high schools throughout the country establish or expand #coding education programs by creating a new grant program within the National Activities Fund at @usedgov.As the Senate #FarmBill moves to the floor for consideration, I've urged the #Agriculture Committee’s strong support for the @USDA's export programs &amp; asked it to increase funding for the Market Access Program (#MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (#FMDP).Today I pressed @SecAzar on the Trump Administration’s family separation immigration policies and asked about the department’s plans for reunifying children with their parents.

https://t.co/gq52Tn2MJZI am committed, now more than ever, to work towards the kind of country we all know we can be—where everyone is treated equally, no matter who they are or who they love. #EqualityForward #PrideMonthI disagree with @SecretaryPerry's proposal to subsidized high-cost #coal to compete with natural gas in #renewable markets.I've introduced legislation to great a competitive grant program that would be available for local high schools to advance #computerscience and #coding skills that are critical to the jobs of the future, national security, and the economic competitiveness of the United States.Yesterday @SenAngusKing &amp; I led a bipartisan group of 13 senators to call on the Senate #Agriculture Committee to increase #FarmBill funding for 2 programs that help thousands of family #farms &amp; small- to medium-sized ag enterprises export their products to international markets.We must continue to fight all forms of discrimination that #LGBTQ people continue to face and ensure that there are comprehensive federal nondiscrimination protections in place. #EqualityForward #PrideMonthIn our state, Ms. Ibis Obeida Guzman Colindres is an asylum seeker from Honduras being held at SeaTac prison. She has not seen her son in over a month. Today I pressed the Trump Administration on its plans for reunifying Ms. Guzman Golindres with her son.

https://t.co/ZTeY230k9NToday I questioned Trump Administration nominees for the Department of @Energy. Watch our exchanges here:

https://t.co/speQkO6hZqIn Washington state, we are hikers, bikers, anglers, climbers, skiers, and so much more. We need to reauthorize the #LWCF now so we can continue to explore our beautiful state by protecting some of its most precious lands. #SaveLWCF

https://t.co/kN0jHMygzYThree years ago today, the U.S. Supreme Court took an important step towards ending discrimination against many families across our country. #EqualityForward #PrideMonth #SCOTUS https://t.co/3pIEwP2CZQToday, I secured a commitment from @SecAzar to ensure all immigrant parents and children held separately from each other have the ability to communicate. https://t.co/18sqYNqza8While limited media reports and Senate hearings have shed light on President Trump's “zero tolerance” policy, its exact scope &amp; impact remains unclear. This cruel treatment of children &amp; families arriving to the United States demands immediate and direct Congressional oversight.Our cheap hydro system has been the backbone of our economy for decades, allowing many industries to flourish because of low electricity rates. The Trump Administration's proposal to privatize @bonnevillepower is a bad idea that has been soundly rejected before and will be again.The Senate must seek answers from the Trump Administration on the standards of care provided to the children rendered unaccompanied by the “zero tolerance” policy, including staffing ratios, credentials for contractors &amp; background checks for individuals caring for the children.The Trump Administration's proposal to privatize @bonnevillepower is a terrible idea.

https://t.co/v43Ag7DfPLI joined my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to demand answers from the Trump Administration on these and other questions. We are awaiting @SecAzar’s response.

Read more here:

https://t.co/WqK4VMXh0pWhat is the process for reuniting children separated from their parents at the border? Is it different from the process for other unaccompanied children?What is the administration doing to proactively find the parents of detained children and help them make contact with their children?Does the administration have a system to ensure parents in federal custody can speak with their children on a daily basis? Does this system extend to parents who have already been deported from the United States?Does the administration ensure parents and relatives who are non-English speaking are provided with materials and instructions in their native language, or are translation services provided?Does the administration have a system to ensure parents or their attorneys can locate their children?How many children are in the custody of @HHSGov who were separated from their parents at the border and have not yet been reunified with their parents or released to local family members?While we are encouraged that President Trump has signed an executive order to stop the unnecessary and cruel separation of children from their families, by no means is this crisis over. Here are some of the outstanding questions I still have for the Trump Administration:Individual businesses that fight every day to get access to Asian markets, to India, to Canada, to Mexico —believe in a #trade policy that keeps moving forward. Why? Because they gain access to a middle class around the globe.

With #cherry harvest beginning in the Pacific Northwest, time is of the essence.I want to make sure that our strong #trading economy, particularly #agriculture, doesn't lose shelf space to the Australians, Canadians, or anybody else. When all is said &amp; done, we don't want to wake up 10 years later &amp; realize we’re 15 or 20 or 30 points behind in a market.Last month, China responded to Trump's #tariffs with a 15% tariff on items including apples, pears, cherries &amp; wine. For Pacific Northwest #cherries, China is the top export destination. If these tariffs remain, the financial impact to Washington’s growers will be very harmful.#DidYouKnow: Last year, Washington state #potato growers exported over $37 million in frozen potatoes to Mexico. And Mexico is the 2nd largest market for Washington’s #RedDelicious apples. https://t.co/aptjejFHuJIndia recently notified the @WTO that it plans to raise its tariff on #apples, describing this increase as retaliation for President Trump's #tariffs on aluminum &amp; steel. An 80% tariff on apples entering India would have a grave impact on Washington’s growers.Thank you @FERC Commissioners Chatterjee and @RichGlickFERC for highlighting the need for stronger cybersecurity standards for natural gas pipelines.

https://t.co/1aGkB5w83eI am concerned about the detainees who were moved to SeaTac. The Trump Administration’s policy of separating children from their parents is inhumane &amp; contrary to American values. Congress must take immediate action to end this cruel and senseless policy.

https://t.co/OozIHl03yKAmericans know #netneutrality isn’t a partisan issue. When our state passed net neutrality protections earlier this year, it was done on a #bipartisan basis.

In an information age, information is the critical tool, whether you’re seeking an education, seeking to participate in commerce, or seeking information in healthcare. https://t.co/w1QkDipnrKWe need to protect the internet from being artificially slowed down, from throttling, or from exorbitant prices that would affect startup companies. #NetNeutralitySenate Republicans voted to give big cable the keys to the internet so they can block, slow down, or manipulate consumer access. They'll give every excuse possible about why they sided with big cable, but one thing is clear: Protecting #NetNeutrality is an economic necessity.In the United States, just 3 providers of internet access have about 70% of the consumers. In any market with only a few players, it's essential that we protect businesses and consumers, and that is exactly what #NetNeutrality does.The #openinternet rule was created to protect a level playing field and to make sure no one can throttle access or block content. We must overturn the @FCC's repeal of #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/ibjM623vNFBy repealing #NetNeutrality, the @FCC is giving cable companies the ability to raise your rates even more. That's what this debate is about. There has to be a free and open internet. Let's get back to innovation and creating more jobs, not artificially slowing down the internet.We can’t let a few big cable companies be the ones to determine who wins and loses in the content wars. #NetNeutrality impacts all of us and we have to keep up the fight to protect it. https://t.co/DR886QiStILast week, I demanded @realDonaldTrump end his inhumane policy of separating innocent children from their families at the border.

Read it here: 👇 https://t.co/BJCMgpfyW7We know that internet is a basic necessity. When a service is that essential and critical to a community and its economic success, we need to make sure that consumers have protections. #NetNeutralityOur Democratic colleagues in the House are taking up the fight for an open and free internet. But now it’s time for House Republicans to decide: will they stand with big cable or will they stand with consumers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses? #NetNeutralityIn our state, Republicans and Democrats came together to #SaveTheInternet and protect #NetNeutrality. Why can’t we see this same bipartisanship in the U.S. House?We want to protect the strong innovation economy from the artificial slowing down of the internet.

Trade wars cause U.S. exporters to lose market share and shelf space, which are hard to regain. The Administration must resolve these disputes through negotiations.

https://t.co/U1OE18TM5DI want to make sure that firefighters have every tool available to help fight these #wildfires. They need to be as safe and efficient as possible.

https://t.co/QqS5SvCzDxWashington state is rich with natural beauty. From dense forests &amp; striking mountains to vast waters &amp; treasured wildlife, we must preserve our natural environment for generations to come. #WorldEnvironmentDay https://t.co/GrTf56DKpQBristol Bay supports 12,000 commercial fisheries jobs &amp; 10,000 #salmon-related industry jobs across the U.S., including thousands in our state. @USACEHQ should hold public meetings in Washington state to give our stakeholders the opportunity to weigh in.

https://t.co/SFXgsQeG6vAccording to recently released forecasts, the Pacific Northwest will likely have an above average #fireseason this year. Ensuring #firefighters have the necessary tools to fight fires while remaining safe &amp; effective is a top priority for me. 🔥Due to the importance of #BristolBay fisheries to our economy, Washington fishermen, suppliers, and businesses have an enormous interest in ensuring that Bristol Bay #salmon continue to thrive for generations.

https://t.co/4nBGMdgjia#PugetSound is one of the busiest, most complex waterways in the world. We rely on these #pilots for the safe passage of millions of cargo containers, more than 100,000 vehicles and 200,000 tons of bulk cargo every year. It is such a major responsibility.

https://t.co/Fy3IuP5q3sLIVE NOW: I'm examining the 2018 Wildland #Fire Outlook and the Wildland Fire Management Programs at the Department of the @Interior and the U.S. @ForestService at an Energy Committee hearing. 🔥 Follow along here:

https://t.co/hRLYsnWlwbSTARTING SOON: This morning I'll be holding a hearing focused on the 2018 #Wildfire Season Outlook. 🔥 Watch live at 7:00 am PDT:

https://t.co/hRLYsnWlwbToday’s ruling is a reminder that the fight against discrimination must continue. Washington state is a leader in protecting #LGBTQ people from discrimination. Congress should follow Washington’s lead and pass the Equality Act. #OpenToAll https://t.co/okW7NujpRHSo happy to see @UWSoftball heading to the Women's College World Series finals tonight. Best of luck in the championship series! #WCWS #MightyAreTheWomen https://t.co/laVSvkkWxbThe Basic Health Program, which is bringing low-cost, comprehensive coverage to nearly 800,000 people, is a successful model we should expand. We can also lower costs &amp; improve quality by continuing to innovate in the delivery of care.Americans need stability &amp; affordability in #health insurance—not the chaos caused by the Trump Administration.The Trump Administration’s push to allow junk #insurance plans &amp; eliminate cost-sharing reductions for low-income people is making it harder for Washington families to pay the bills &amp; access care.In Washington state, #TitleX‒funded sites delivered contraceptive care to 82,520 women in 2015. Title X‒supported #PlannedParenthood health centers served 80% of these women. #IStandWithPP https://t.co/0Kw4vrPaAXThe #USCGC ACTIVE crew based out of Port Angeles should be very proud of its recent counterdrug patrol, during which they successfully seized $95 million worth of cocaine. Thank you for keeping our waters safe and your ongoing commitment to service. https://t.co/dpZNs8CtBMTrump’s #gagrule bars patients from receiving information to make informed decisions about their own #reprohealth. I oppose any effort to undermine the integrity of #TitleX.Pacific Northwest fishermen, shipbuilders, suppliers, sportsmen, and restaurants have built an economy around this one-of-a-kind sustainable fishery. The stakes are too high to leave out their important voices.

https://t.co/ZWI7im7pr8In keeping with longstanding legal, ethical &amp; medical standards of #healthcare, Title X providers can offer patients medically-accurate counseling on &amp; referrals for all pregnancy options, including parenting, adoption &amp; abortion. I oppose efforts to undermine #TitleX.The Trump Administration is carrying out a constant &amp; concerted attack on women’s health &amp; rights. It is undermining the #TitleX family planning program &amp; implementing a new gag rule that interferes with doctors’ ability to provide patients info about #reproductivecare.#DidYouKnow: Each year, roughly 4,000,000 people rely on #TitleX-funded health centers for basic preventive health care, including cancer screenings, birth control, STI screenings, pregnancy testing, and well-woman exams.The doctor shortage for our rural communities continues, and we need to fight that. We have counties in our state that have 4,000 people and no access to #healthcare. We’ve got to do better.

https://t.co/41IXtI97iGTitle X has helped women avoid 822,000 unintended pregnancies. It also yields critical cost savings to our #healthcare system—every $1 invested in #TitleX saves more than $7 in Medicaid-related costs.Washington state has 5 of the highest threat #volcanoes in the nation, and they are a persistent &amp; serious threat. Our #volcano legislation will ensure we have the science, technology and monitoring needed to keep people informed and safe.

https://t.co/6O3rM2GIJk#TitleX providers offer confidential, medically accurate, and evidence-based care. Implementing Trump's domestic #gagrule would do enormous harm to the millions of patients across the country who count on the high standard of medical care provided by these health centers.Mexico alone is the number one market for Washington state #apples, contributing more than $215 million to our economy and local wages every year. I am very concerned about the Trump Administration’s approach to dealing with our allies.

https://t.co/vwpW4u1SDaThe Trump Administration has taken regulatory actions to tilt #TitleX away from evidence-based #familyplanning. I believe federal health policy should be evidence-based &amp; produced with the best interests of patients in mind.Retweet if you agree: Every woman deserves the freedom to make her own #healthcare choices. I stand against President Trump’s ongoing attacks on women’s reproductive health.I recently called for improvements to a @HUDgov program that assists Native American veterans in finding housing in Indian Country—allowing them to live near their families and have access to culturally appropriate and traditional healing practices.I oppose efforts to undermine #TitleX and believe federal health policy should be evidence-based &amp; produced with the best interests of patients in mind. #NoGagRule https://t.co/Qt7R4WoouMIt was wonderful to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Washington’s Pilotage Act this week with @PattyMurray and this fantastic group in Port Townsend. https://t.co/blpwIE17NQI joined over 200 of my colleagues &amp; sent a letter to @SecAzar opposing any implementation of a domestic gag rule on #TitleX—the only federal grant program solely dedicated to family planning &amp; related preventive services. #NoGagRuleWashington state fishermen, sportsmen, and small business owners deserve to have a seat at the table as the @USACEHQ considers the proposed #PebbleMine. The stakes are too high to leave out these important voices.Due to the importance of #BristolBay fisheries to our economy, Washington fishermen, suppliers, and businesses have an enormous interest in ensuring that Bristol Bay #salmon continue to thrive for generations.As the @USACEHQ considers the environmental impact of the proposed #PebbleMine in Bristol Bay, Alaska, I've called on it to hold public meetings in our state and to expand the public comment period on the mine to give Washington state stakeholders the opportunity to weigh in.#TitleX is the only federal grant program solely dedicated to family planning &amp; related preventive services. I oppose the Administration’s latest attack on Title X. #IStandWithPP https://t.co/bYjkW5CliUFor too long, addictive drugs have flooded our communities, tearing apart families &amp; burdening society with extra costs. My #opioid legislation strengthens federal penalties on drug companies that fail to monitor &amp; report suspicious distribution practices.
https://t.co/H6RvYt57W6Nearly two-thirds of #TitleX patients have incomes at or below the federal poverty level, and 43% of patients are uninsured. In 2016, nearly 4,000 Title X-funded health centers provided 720,000 Pap tests, nearly 1 million women with breast exams, and 1.2 million HIV tests.Congratulations to @HanfordFalcon junior Joseph Marsh of Richland for receiving the Medal of Merit from the @BoyScouts. Your quick thinking and selfless bravery is truly commendable.

https://t.co/qISRytJOOHThank you, @USCG Admiral Zukunft, for your humble leadership and career of service to the U.S. Coast Guard. Your legacy will continue to make waves of change for decades to come. Congratulations on your well-deserved retirement after more than 4 decades of service to our nation! https://t.co/PEJ8nlm8R8I’m fighting for robust investment in the #cleanenergy economy, proactive training programs for these jobs, and continued investment in science and technology to feed the low-carbon innovation pipeline.One year ago today, President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord. We must all redouble our efforts to reduce emissions and find innovative ways to fight #climatechange because our current president never will.These tariffs put that opportunity in jeopardy, along with putting other U.S. exports to Canada and the European Union at risk. The Administration must resolve these disputes through negotiations.Mexico alone is the number one market for Washington state apples, contributing more than $215 million to our economy and local wages every year. American apples make up 50% of the total apple market in Mexico.I am very concerned about the Trump Administration’s approach to dealing with our allies. Trade wars cause U.S. exporters to lose market share and shelf space, which are hard to regain.Every day our nation owes its fallen heroes an eternal debt of gratitude and respect. It is our duty to make sure they are never forgotten.

https://t.co/Q5iwm6X1svOur state has 5 of the highest threat #volcanoes in the nation, and as we’re seeing in Hawaii right now, these volcanoes are a persistent and serious threat. Our legislation will ensure we have the tools needed to keep people informed and safe.

https://t.co/ryUIeLvd3LThis dangerous pipeline project threatens our environment, fisheries, and Tribal treaty rights. We must stand up to protect our orcas and salmon and defend our way of life in the Pacific Northwest.Due to this threat of irreversible #oilspill damage to the Salish Sea, I oppose the pipeline.The @USCG has been clear: we do not know how to clean up tar sands #oilspills. Allowing a dramatic increase in tar sands tanker traffic in the Salish Sea is shortsighted and dangerous.The safety of our communities is paramount, and our #volcano legislation will ensure we have the science, technology and monitoring needed to keep people informed and safe.

https://t.co/WdvW6DR58cThe #LanderStreet Bridge Project will increase safety, reduce congestion, and help move Washington state products around the globe.

https://t.co/lJ8N0qlyQQThe Lander Street Bridge Project will increase safety, reduce congestion, and help move Washington state products around the globe. It was great to be there today for the groundbreaking. https://t.co/mcxruBaTpQBy creating an overpass on #LanderStreet, commuters will have easier access to the SODO area, local businesses will be able to keep their delivery schedules and have easier access to their customers, and trucks moving between I-5 and the waterfront will see travel times reduced. https://t.co/LeurOthrI8Today I joined @MayorJenny &amp; @COGregoire at the groundbreaking of the #LanderStreet Bridge Project in Seattle. This bridge will provide much-needed traffic relief &amp; improve safety for commuters &amp; freight operations in our state’s largest &amp; densest manufacturing &amp; industrial area. https://t.co/u8l8TIoMEkOn #MemorialDay, we pay tribute to our fellow Americans who gave their lives fighting for our country and our way of life. Today we convey the appreciation of a grateful nation to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect the United States and all it stands for. https://t.co/SadBg6NndBThe doctor shortage for our rural communities continues, and we need to fight that. We have counties in our state that have 4,000 people and no #healthcare access. We’ve got to do better.The American people want to know what President Trump plans to do about rising #gasprices.

https://t.co/YNuqp2ScAlI oppose efforts to undermine #TitleX and believe federal health policy should be evidence-based &amp; produced with the best interests of patients in mind. #NoGagRule https://t.co/U7c3FLXGzVProject #ECHO, a program being led in our state by @UWMedicine, facilitates connections between doctors and other #healthcare providers around the state. #Telemedicine is another delivery system that allows professionals in Seattle to consult with people over in the Yakima Basin.This is a very positive step. The State Department and Canada must now work to include input from all parties.

https://t.co/if1gU0GCoTIn @SpokaneCity, #gasprices have risen 25 cents per gallon in just the last month, and drivers filling up their tanks today are paying $5-$10 more at the pump than they did a year ago.

https://t.co/WWEEePqzPBIn Washington state, #TitleX‒funded sites delivered contraceptive care to 82,520 women in 2015. Title X‒supported #PlannedParenthood health centers served 80% of these women. #IStandWithPP https://t.co/u4jseY2pdJThe impact of rising #gasprices on family budgets &amp; our economy is significant &amp; widespread. The run up in oil prices will roughly cancel out positive effects from #taxcuts this year, with the greatest impact on those that can least afford it.

https://t.co/bVhJm8sYw5#TitleX is the only federal grant program solely dedicated to family planning &amp; related preventive services. I oppose the Administration’s latest attack on Title X. #IStandWithPP https://t.co/AY8KlmbsKVAccess to #healthcare through the #Medicaid expansion was big in rural communities in our state. At large, 600,000 people in our state got expanded coverage. Counties like Douglas and Chelan have seen their uninsured rates drop by more than 60% thanks to that.
