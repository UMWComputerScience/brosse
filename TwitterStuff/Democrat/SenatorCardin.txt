Live from #Baltimore #FamiiesBelongTogether  https://t.co/84BZas2xTlThank you to the teachers, nurses, families and all those with us in #Baltimore to defend children and families. @realDonaldTrump is wrong on immigration because #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/hgaqGaBGrGWe're gathered here in #Baltimore to say that #FamiliesBelongTogether... and we need to reunite children with their parents now. https://t.co/FXfwtmFzhKOur #GunViolence epidemic requires our collective honesty. We must put an end to the suggestion that Americans must choose between their Constitutional rights and the safety of their families. That's just false. We are fully capable of having both, and we must insist that we do.But today, I am also thinking about how condolences are inadequate. It is a tragedy that this cycle of #GunViolence continues to play itself out, over and over again, while lawmakers offer thoughts and prayers instead of action. This cycle must end, and it must end with us.I want to thank Anne Arundel County Police and all the first responders who rushed headlong into danger to save others' lives yesterday. This tragedy could have been even worse without their quick action. And I'm grateful to @ATFHQ and @FBI for assisting officers at the scene.Thread:

Today I'm thinking about the five Maryland families who went to bed last night without their loved one. I'm thinking about the good people at @capgaznews who've lost dear friends and colleagues. My heart hurts for them. Yesterday's shooting in Annapolis was a gut punch.Devastating. My heart is with Capital Gazette and the people of Annapolis right now. As information continues to come in, I remain as grateful as ever for our first responders. If you're in the area, please stay inside and stay safe. https://t.co/PyCAjfvd1RWhat's disgraceful, Mr. President, is your repeated suggestions that we should trust Vladimir Putin – a brutal autocrat – over the unanimous, unequivocal conclusions of your own intelligence community.

There is in fact only ONE question, and that's "why?"
https://t.co/2RoaK4Do4R https://t.co/UfE2oY0fwN.@POTUS already indicated he's going to pick a #SCOTUS nominee from a list of extremist judges drawn up by conservative advocacy groups, who will be a rubber stamp on his abuses of power &amp; willingly roll back civil rights. Both the GOP and Democrats should reject such a process. https://t.co/PH2mHCwlvWI can assure you that we have not forgotten about Merrick Garland. We know the abuses of @SenateMajLdr and the Republican leadership. What they did to President Obama and his nominee for the Supreme Court was nothing short of outrageous. https://t.co/KymdJYqZirCongress must now take action to restore fairness and equity for our public-sector unions, which helped build our country and our middle class. Working people should have the right to join together to improve their workplaces and earn wages and benefits that can support a family.As Justice Kagan said in her dissent, "The majority has chosen the winners by turning the First Amendment into a sword, and using it against workaday economic and regulatory policy… the First Amendment was meant for better things." #JanusSCOTUS has made it possible for millions of public-sector workers to get the protections &amp; benefits of collective bargaining without paying their fair share for that representation. Today's decision is a partisan bending of the law and an attack on middle class Americans. #Janus https://t.co/tCviXTKuHtSupreme Court Justice Sotomayor's dissenting opinion in today's #TravelBan decision is an eloquent defense of American values and the U.S. Constitution. A ray of light in this dark episode. Worth a read. #IDissent https://t.co/v4JTNmROmDSCOTUS' decision to uphold @POTUS' discriminatory #TravelBan is deeply disturbing and suited to serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists. Today is a major blow to American values and our country's standing as leader of the free world. The ramifications are spine-chilling.Then-candidate-Donald Trump stated plain as day his desire to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Today, the Supreme Court saw fit to fulfill his campaign promise and xenophobic desires. This decision is as inexplicable as it is disturbing. #TravelBan https://t.co/0t22pbCWt1Today's the day, Maryland. It's Primary #ElectionDay -- and this election season, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. Vote, and make sure your voice is heard. Polls are open now through 8 PM tonight.

You can find your polling place here: https://t.co/CNXYPix1IT https://t.co/JU40XlylpYGreat visit to @TheStartupNest today. Baltimore's largest minority-owned business incubator is helping to grow #smallbiz, keep talent and entrepreneurs right here in Maryland, and bring real economic relief to Baltimore's communities. https://t.co/EuEa3j4Tzt.@POTUS' war on the #environment continues. After proposing coast-to-coast drilling, looser oil spill safety standards, and canceling water pollution controls, this new #ExecutiveOrder makes it official policy to ignore climate change, sea level rise and other imminent threats. https://t.co/0Itti0coTLI still have questions for @POTUS:

1. How many children remain separated from their parents?

2. When and how will they be reunited? This must happen ASAP.

3. Why haven't you rescinded the harmful "zero tolerance" policy that's responsible for this crisis? #KeepFamiliesTogetherI've written to the Trump Administration demanding a plan for reuniting the 2,300 children who were forcibly separated from their parents. This is the next critical step in undoing the cruelty &amp; damage @POTUS' policies have inflicted. https://t.co/87S1R6K3Qw #KeepFamiliesTogetherIn Cumberland meeting with the many partners working together to increase public access, reduce sewage overflows and boost economic activity along the C&amp;O Canal and Potomac riverfront. Connecting people with nature makes good civic and business sense - and this effort is prooof. https://t.co/nDJotxCSrrYou must answer these questions, commit to alternatives to detention centers, and finally admit to the American people that this policy of tearing children from their families was your Administration's doing, that it was deliberate, and that you had the power to end it all along.2. Why haven't you rescinded the harmful "zero tolerance" policy that's responsible for this crisis?

3. What's your plan for safeguarding the families seeking asylum? The mothers and fathers bringing their children to our ports of entry, because the alternative is death?At a rally outside the U.S. Capitol to #KeepFamiliesTogether, because we still have questions for @POTUS.

1. What's your plan for reuniting the 2,300 children who were already separated from their parents? When will we see it? https://t.co/7xgB9WmraVMaryland, primary elections are underway, and today is the last day of #EarlyVoting. Make sure your voice is heard.

Remember: if you aren't registered to vote, you can register in-person at your nearest Early Voting Center, then vote immediately after: https://t.co/zOIz2saJjVWe are the United States of America. We must be part of the solution, not part of the problem.

Today we must all rise to say that we are great enough, and strong enough, to not have to choose between our values and our security – we can and should have both. #WorldRefugeeDayHalf the world's 25.4 million refugees are children. Devastating, particularly as the world bears witness to asylum-seeking parents and children being ripped apart at our border. @POTUS could end this today. And he could lift his refugee resettlement cap today. #WorldRefugeeDayThis #WorldRefugeeDay we're grappling with the news that 68.5 million people worldwide were displaced in 2017 – 25.4 million of them refugees who left their home country, fleeing violence or persecution. 

We are not powerless to help them. We can, and must, be their voice. https://t.co/l14YKaWfzm.@POTUS' inhumane policy of forcibly separating young children from their families at our border is cruel, inhumane, and simply isn't necessary for the enforcement of our laws. 

What's more, it's downright unAmerican. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/zsflEFvJQaHere is @TheJusticeDept memo ordering the "zero tolerance" policy responsible for young children being forcibly separated from their parents.

Facts are stubborn things, @POTUS. And the facts here are clear: you, and you alone, own this cruelty. End it now. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/VBIJFYj4WI"Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert. These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II."

Well said, @LauraWBush. https://t.co/xjfC2Vce9LToday let's remember the thousands of fathers at our border who have been forcibly separated from their children due to @POTUS' inhumane policies.

We have a moral obligation to stand up against this cruelty and pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act. #FathersDayOfAction.@POTUS continues to demonstrate complete disregard for Kim Jong Un's extensive history of human rights abuses, including his history of systematically starving his own people. We should be able to negotiate a nuclear deal without negotiating our values.

https://t.co/g0gKGRUutOHorrific. @POTUS: How does this make us safer? How is this justice? If this is what you think "making America great again" looks like, you don't understand America.

I join my @SenateDems colleagues in calling for an immediate end to this cruelty. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct https://t.co/ZfmTpky96cBarbaric. Unnecessary. UnAmerican. There's no other way to describe @POTUS' policy of separating young children from their mothers and fathers – many of whom seek asylum. It doesn't make us safer. It only makes us smaller.

I'm proud to co-sponsor S. 3036. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/fMbvwLrWlGMaryland, #EarlyVoting starts TODAY. Your voice matters. Make sure it's heard.

Congratulations again to the @Capitals on bringing so much excitement and pride to D.C., and thanks for letting me celebrate with you. Until it has its own senators, it's a privilege to represent the District however I can. Maryland and I are proud to be #ALLCAPS https://t.co/rX8si6zdTqJust had the honor of meeting Ethiopian journalist and human rights activist @EskinderNega, who was imprisoned for his work. A solemn reminder we cannot take freedom of the press for granted.

Thank you to him and @FreedomNowOrg for coming by to discuss Ethiopia's future with me. https://t.co/Ay94B1NTfMAs the school year winds down, MD families are struggling with the high cost of obtaining child care over the summer. And they need our support. That's why I've cosponsored the Child Care for Working Families Act; working parents deserve to have quality #SummerCare within reach.As schools let out this Friday and we look toward summer, let's remember the unique challenge this season presents for working parents. The cost of #SummerCare is often 20% of a family's income. Let's support them. Let's pass the Child Care for Working Families Act. https://t.co/BHZqkf4g4TFinally, but critically: any agreement reached must go through Congress. @POTUS has committed to that, and he must honor it.

He should also honor American values by putting an end to his gratuitous praise of Kim Jong Un, a brutal and violent dictator. #NorthKoreaSummitAny path forward from here must entail #NorthKorea making a complete declaration of their nuclear programs, verifying that those programs are frozen, allowing international inspectors to see exactly what is going on, and agreeing to the removal of nuclear weapons and materials.THREAD: Kim Jong Un has now achieved a long-sought goal: international legitimacy through a meeting with @POTUS. Trump's repeated praise for the brutal dictator notwithstanding, in exchange for that meeting we need verifiable progress toward ending #NorthKorea's nuclear program.This is a debate of whether we are on the side of big utility-type companies or individuals and small businesses to guarantee them equal access to this critical service. Almost half of consumers have no choice of ISP. This is not about competition but preventing discrimination.Seventy percent of small business owners feel that they are at a disadvantage compared to larger businesses due to their size and market power. The internet gives them capacity to try to equalize that disadvantage. Congress should support a free and open internet.We can #SaveTheInternet if the House will take a vote like the Senate.  ISPs should not have the last word in what any American can see on the internet. Congress has a chance to put consumers and #SmallBiz first.    #NetNeutralityReminder: new estimates put Hurricane Maria's death toll at more than 4,000 Americans. Unspeakably tragic. We need to be doing more for #PuertoRico, starting with ongoing aid for their hospitals. I'm again calling on my colleagues and @POTUS to join me in committing to more.This week I joined 39 of my @SenateDems colleagues in calling on @POTUS to end his Administration's inhumane policy of separating innocent children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border. It is a cruel, unnecessary practice, and it's not who we are. https://t.co/VpD9RUGRq7If only @POTUS' bias for Russia weren't so obvious. #G7Summit https://t.co/xOlBMGz3PmAfter receiving stacks of petitions from the students at Argyle Middle School, I joined them to discuss the many commonsense ways to reduce gun violence. These kids are still waiting for adults to act like adults and do more to protect them and their schools. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/LfmK7uNR6USpent this morning celebrating the #YearoftheAnacostia and discussing conservation challenges with leaders of the @anacostiaws. An amazing environmental transformation is underway along the Anacostia - and we can all be a part of it! https://t.co/qUq2EIMQuj@MichaelMathes @Capitals @timkaine @MarkWarner @ChrisVanHollen @ChrisCoons @SenatorCarper WE ARE #ALLCAPS TONIGHT! https://t.co/LzUxn88p9QThe health and safety of our fellow countrymen must always be our first priority, regardless of whatever else is happening in the news. We cannot grow complacent to #PuertoRico's struggle. They are Americans. They are our brothers and sisters. Failing them is not an option. https://t.co/5WKvQacuKqA new estimate puts Hurricane Maria's death toll at more than 4,000 Americans, and counting, as #PuertoRico's hospitals still struggle to rebuild. Unacceptable. They need ongoing aid. I call on my colleagues and @POTUS to join me in committing to more. https://t.co/zPQCuWi78T74 years ago, U.S. troops and allies took a stand against Nazi tyranny and executed a bold assault on the beaches of Normandy. Let us express our gratitude by resisting the reemergence of nationalist and racist influences, and by holding today's authoritarians accountable. #DDay https://t.co/E8GEGjf6sZThe Equal Rights Amendment would provide a constitutional basis for claims of gender-based violence, and give Congress the constitutional basis to pass a law giving women victimized by gender-based violence legal recourse in federal courts. One of many reasons we need the #ERANow https://t.co/Or908ERfbwThis is important. Watch if you can. The Equal Rights Amendment is barely longer than a tweet, but would finally, expressly prohibit gender-based discrimination in our Constitution – and that’s long overdue. #ERANow https://t.co/hQ0JDEUkTv.@POTUS' claim that Democrats are responsible for children being separated from their families at the border is not based in any reality. Make no mistake: the president alone is responsible for this inhumane policy, and it's entirely within his power to fix it. https://t.co/iAtvwb9DmdMaryland, today is the last day to register to #vote online before the primary on June 26. Your vote makes a difference, and your voice matters. Make sure it's heard: https://t.co/3axCj84V7X#ALLCAPSTrump’s ‘America First’ strategy has always really meant ‘America Alone.’ @POTUS continues to embarrass, anger, alienate our closest friends and allies, further isolating and endangering our country.
https://t.co/N9AajwvlJQA majority of justices were clear that discrimination based on sexual orientation or religion are both wrong. To add clarity at the federal level, Congress should pass the Equality Act. Every American deserves the same freedoms and same protections under the law.Today #SCOTUS made it clear that LGBT individuals should not be discriminated against or face ‘indignities,’ as described by Justice Kennedy, ‘when they seek goods and services in an open market.' #OpenToAll https://t.co/6R8yAuaopFSorry @POTUS , in the United States of America, no one - not even the president - is above the law. https://t.co/hrMpWcLLEEI support universal background checks for all firearms purchases.  An overwhelming majority of Americans – Democrats, Republicans, NRA members and others – support some kind of expanded background checks. https://t.co/Ib7D1ZxoJeThe safety of our children and communities should never be put at risk by partisan gridlock. It is outrageous that the Senate cannot come together on common sense gun safety legislation despite public support for so many of these measures.  #WearOrange https://t.co/gx7H4eOlsUGood question! We’ve been at this for many years now, but the finish line is in reach. Who will be the next state to step up? Who will put us over the finish line?  https://t.co/LQurTKXygqThank you to all the partners who made this possible. This is about developing the very best potential in all our children and giving them and their families the tools they need to succeed. It goes far beyond the classroom. https://t.co/j789xNzVIR@RecNParks @MayorPugh50 @ChrisVanHollen @UMBC An incredible center for students and the community. https://t.co/aUPiblWTiQMarylanders know #climatechange is real and dangerous. The future of MD's coastal communities depend on #climateaction. @POTUS decision, one year ago today, to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement put America alone and America last.Rather than steamrolling our allies and major trading partners, let’s see some diplomacy and real negotiating toward trade relationships that do not upend the global economy - especially the American economy.What’s lacking in all this bluster is a rational strategy. If there is one, I urge the president to share it with the American people. We need a long-term plan to tackle our economic challenges and protect American workers. https://t.co/CmDQ9wNPWcThe fight for equality has gained momentum, thanks to Illinois! https://t.co/2uTpJijZ1F@MissZippy1 Yes, of course. This page will need an update to include Illinois, but it should answer your question more fully. https://t.co/mdZS0U4KTCThe 27th Amendment, which prohibited immediate congressional pay raises, was ratified after 203 years. There should be no deadline keeping America from recognizing women as equals under the law.Most Americans are shocked to find out that the U.S. Constitution still lacks a provision ensuring gender equality. It's long past time to recognize the equality of women in the foundation document for U.S. law.Thank you, Illinois!  We need just ONE more state to ratify and we need Congress to do its part by passing S.J.Res. 5, which would immediately remove the arbitrary and unnecessary deadline for states to ratify the #ERA. https://t.co/HYctouZeAATonight I had the chance to thank the first responders who ran toward danger during the #ECFlood. Their actions saved lives. I am grateful for their efforts, and for those working to provide recovery assistance for #EllicottCity residents and businesses. @fema @SBA #ECStrong https://t.co/IByC0H2IMuImportant information for those directly affected by the flooding in #EllicottCityMD https://t.co/40Sg3KTBC8We (the federal delegation) are part of this team along w/ @HoCoGovExec and @GovLarryHogan and we will do everything we can to help #EllicottCity -- recognizing the incredible challenge it will be, going through this again.  @ChrisVanHollen @JohnSarbanes #TeamMaryland https://t.co/5FAhCqMdrIOwners of #small biz throughout #EllicottCity telling us about the tough decisions that lay ahead. @ChrisVanHollen @JourneyFromJunk @HorseSpiritArts #GreatPanes https://t.co/CJNu1UX7q9.@HoCoGovExec tells us the damage is worse than 2016.

Remarkable this is happening once again. https://t.co/Z6Q7yzPu95On this #MemorialDay18, we are reminded that many heroes never stop serving our communities after their enlistments end. https://t.co/sznlhGWfBRAs I pray for the families of our fallen this weekend, I will also pray for our men and women currently serving at home and abroad along with their families. I am grateful for those who have served our country past and present and I will continue to do my very best to serve them.One of the best ways to honor our fallen heroes is for us to work together to defend our freedom and our American principles. We cannot allow the erosion of the liberties our friends and neighbors have fought so hard to defend.They and those like them deserve every honor we can bestow.          As we consider the cost of our freedom, let us also remember the families of our fallen, our Gold Star families. We recognize the tremendous loss to these great American families and admire their patriotism.I remember the sacrifices of my fellow citizens from MD like those of Specialist Tocarra Green during this time. She was the 1st woman from MD to die in the Iraq War. I remember Sergeant Erick M. Houck, a Baltimore native like me, who died in Afghanistan just last year.Across our proud nation this #MemorialDay2018 , we remember the men and women of our Armed Forces who made the greatest sacrifice imaginable. Whether on the battlefield of Antietam, the beaches of Normandy or in the mountains of Afghanistan, we pay honor to their immense courage.Heartbroken to see flooding again devastate @EllicottCity Main Street. Please respect the directives of emergency personnel and the power of floodwaters. My prayers tonight are with local residents and our first responders.@washingtonpost ... I am proud of the great number of federal workers - public servants- who live and work in MD. They deserve our gratitude and not the partisan-fueled denigration coming from @POTUS . I will do everything possible in Congress to mitigate the implementation of these orders.@washingtonpost ... Donald Trump has failed to recognize that the two million men and women supporting him in the federal government are hardworking, patriotic Americans who typically have put service to their country above personal gain.@washingtonpost President Trump has been relentless in his needless assault on federal workers. This latest strike is an outrageous attempt to strip legal rights and due process from employees and bust unions. Despite more than a year as President of the United States, ...I’ve written to Secretary #DeVos to ensure that the Dept of Education maintains its commitment to students and investigates colleges that enrich for-profit school execs at the expense of taxpayers. https://t.co/IeEYif9Xj7Outrageous. Secretary #DeVos hired for-profit school execs and w/in months the special unit designed to protect students shuttered investigations into 3 for-profit schools. Now they have only 3 staffers to oversee fraud at nearly 6,900 colleges. Draining the swamp? Not.Our students deserve better. Hiring for-profit school executives to oversee the unit investigating for-profit schools creates clear and direct conflicts of interest. And it’s no way to run the Department of Education. https://t.co/nP7e4ud2beThis country stands for the constitutional protections of the First Amendment – the right of freedom of speech. That's what this country is about.

This loss has shaken the community. She was dedicated and had an incredible future ahead of her. #endofwatch https://t.co/oqr9UP8g7sAgree!  And it's good to see you on the floor again. #TeamMaryland https://t.co/xnBQmpbdHMAccess to family planning services is one of the best tools we have to prevent abortions. While I have little faith in Republican leadership to stand up against @realDonaldTrump on behalf of the women of America, I urge them to help us block this policy from ever being enacted.It is appalling that @POTUS continues this relentless assault on women’s health. He fails to see that every move he makes to deny women low-cost, accessible health care options simply to placate his political patrons only puts the lives of women and children at great risk.#TitleXThis is what a real commitment to our teachers and school buildings looks like.

This is what prioritizing our students and their educations looks like.

Maryland has not forgotten.This flooding illustrates the importance of the $225 million I secured for sewer overflow control in this year's #WRDA bill. Those funds will help communities construct separate rain water and sewage water systems, so people can keep using their water even during bad rainstorms. https://t.co/89IgVthSg1I'm continuing to monitor the devastating flooding around Frederick and the Eastern Shore, and encourage residents to stay off the roads unless strictly necessary. Marylanders everywhere should listen closely to their local alert systems and follow @MDMEMA for updates.These remarks are inexcusable. No one, least of all the President of the United States, should engage in such hateful, dehumanizing language. That isn't a high bar. It's disturbing that @POTUS cannot seem to meet it. https://t.co/LBBcDu065QI'm proud to report the Senate just voted to restore #NetNeutrality. This is big. And it's thanks to you. Your phone calls, emails and sustained action gave this cause the momentum it needed.

I urge my colleagues in the House to follow suit and #SavetheInternet as we know it. https://t.co/NQO4zyRLd4Happening now: the Senate votes on #NetNeutrality. I'm proud to have cast my vote in favor of restoring the protections we need to keep the internet free, open and equitable for all. This should be common sense. 

Watch live: https://t.co/6YZdbwR7RUToday's the day. Today we vote on #NetNeutrality. This is our best chance to keep the internet free and open for all -- including small businesses, who need an open internet to compete with large corporations.

So grateful he's feeling better, and look forward to seeing him back to doing good work for the people of Maryland soon. 

https://t.co/P5bNSJ4TUcThis is the result of a sustained and coordinated federal-state effort to recognize the success of Maryland's unique all-payer model, which allows hospitals to focus on preventing illness all while lowering costs and raising quality of care. And that model is working. #healthcare https://t.co/FsD7TaQirXNonprofits in @CharlesCoMD are trying to fill gaps in affordable housing, health care, substance abuse treatment, homeless services and job-related services.

Thankful for the many groups that came together through the Charles County Charitable Trust to share their challenges in meeting the needs of residents.Thank you for having me, and thank you to all the students who came and asked such thoughtful questions.

The only thing our children should be concerned about in school is their education. #GunSafety https://t.co/cFYq4aNvKRPutting internet providers in complete control of what you can see and access online undermines freedom of speech and information. #NetNeutrality ensures the internet remains free and open.

https://t.co/DufjgwppylAs the proud product of Baltimore Public Schools, this #TeacherAppreciationDay I want to thank my most memorable teacher, Mrs. Eddie Brown. Mrs. Brown taught English – and the importance of an education. She instilled in her students a love of learning that I carry with me today.Our public school educators are the heart of our communities, doing the difficult, often thankless work of teaching, inspiring &amp; preparing our children to tackle our greatest challenges.

Those statements make it challenging for him to represent our country.

I cannot support his nomination for SecState.At a time when we'll soon be the only nation not party to the Paris Climate Agreement, and need a surge in diplomacy to resolve crises in Iran &amp; North Korea, we need a Secretary of State who will build meaningful partnerships and bridges in pursuit of our natl security interests.After meeting with Mr. Pompeo and reviewing his testimony, I do not believe he would be an independent voice in advising @POTUS, nor an advocate for leading our allies in support of the values that protect America. I will not be supporting his nomination to be Secretary of State. https://t.co/ODHyZ0XeHuI will always remember Barbara Bush for the graciousness and respect she showed to everyone she met. She was an iconic public servant who dedicated her life to her family and her country.

They deserve better. https://t.co/RG4KJMtAuD#TaxDay is a reminder that the #GOPTaxScam was never designed to help middle-income families. It was designed to help corporations.

Today we remind ourselves of the mayhem that can occur when hatred and discord prevail – when fear is allowed to fester into division. #HolocaustRemembranceDay #NeverAgain https://t.co/p0R5HnV5JjIn reply to my questioning, Mr. Pompeo said "torture is illegal." I agree. But as Sec of State, how would he reconcile his past views &amp; @POTUS' sentiments on torture, which in 2016 included, “I would bring back a lot worse than waterboarding”? Will he stand up to the president?Director Pompeo characterizes @POTUS’ response to Russia's interference in our democracy as "robust." Wildly inaccurate until President Trump imposes all of the legally required sanctions on Putin and actually musters the courage to SAY the Kremlin is a threat.One of my concerns regarding Director Pompeo's nomination for Secretary of State is how – in an administration that is so erratic and philosophically unmoored – he plans to promote human rights &amp; democracy around the world.

Congress must act to protect the Special Counsel and avoid a constitutional crisis.

-make political advertising transparent
-audit election period interference
-convene civil society advisory councils 
-block malicious accountsRegarding Mr. #Zuckerberg's testimony today: I remain deeply unsettled that such a massive breach of privacy not only occurred, but was exploited for political ends, all without millions of users' knowledge. This cannot be allowed to happen again.If we closed the gender wage gap, we'd cut the poverty rate for working women in half and add nearly a half trillion dollars to our economy. Economically, socially, morally — any way you slice it, closing the gap makes sense and is the right thing to do. Full stop. #EqualPayDay#EqualPayDay reminds us that the gender pay gap isn't a women's problem, it's a national problem. No state, family or industry is immune. That's why I support the #PaycheckFairnessAct — because this problem is pervasive, and needs to be tackled head-on.

Still, this is the clearest signal the White House has sent yet that Russia must be held accountable for its malign, destabilizing activities. https://t.co/xNinrDD54rIt's been 9 months since Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass additional sanctions on Russia for its interference in our elections. It's clear @POTUS himself has little interest in enforcing those sanctions.

Yet his memory and his legacy have stood the test of time, and today his words of love, tolerance and equality are as relevant and important as ever. #MLK50 https://t.co/IIjWvreuzkThe existing fuel efficiency standards were spurring innovation, saving Americans money at the pump, and decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels.

Rolling them back both undermines that progress and embodies the very "regulatory uncertainty" this Admin says is such a problem. https://t.co/S2hK7r4Uk6One would think this Administration would want to make it easier for Americans to go farther on a gallon of gas.

In reality, this does nothing but help Big Oil at the expense of middle income Americans who will keep leaving more of their hard-earned paychecks behind at the pump. https://t.co/Qh2svzGk7VIt may be impossible to overstate how short-sighted and foolish this is.

Such a basic value should not be left up to interpretation. #PassTheERA https://t.co/UyiCII2M0xI'm celebrating this #WomensHistoryMonth by calling on my Senate colleagues to #PassTheERA. The Equal Rights Amendment is barely longer than a tweet, but would finally, expressly prohibit gender-based discrimination in our Constitution – and that's long overdue. https://t.co/zKDqzR0EzJThe reaction to each mass shooting runs like clockwork: there is bipartisan shock, anger, and horror. Then GOP leadership returns to their talking points and refuses action.

Today students are saying: not this time. Not on my watch. #EnoughIsEnough. I'm proud to stand with them. https://t.co/QTpPGUQqYQThis is what democracy looks like. #NationalWalkoutDay #Enough https://t.co/tjxhkg3wc6Incredible to see so many Maryland students adding their vibrant voices to this #GunSafety movement. We cannot be complacent to gun violence wreaking havoc on our communities. These students won't allow it – and I'm proud to stand with them. #NationalWalkoutDay #Enough https://t.co/xZDWSEuXixLive from the West Front of the US Capitol... students from Maryland and across the region want to #EndGunViolence https://t.co/aoWD90GPY1Grateful for @BrianFrosh's leadership in calling on Congress to #SaveTPS. TPS recipients are long-time legal residents who have undergone extensive screening, purchased homes and raised families here. They deserve a pathway to permanent residency. https://t.co/EAB9UXNt71Secretary #Tillerson's firing is symptomatic of @POTUS' inability to take independent advice from his advisors. It is disturbing to see such a high-level change in our diplomatic team as negotiations with North Korea move into a new and delicate stage. https://t.co/bkdGEhGkrHI'm hopeful that after his time at the CIA, Director Pompeo has a greater appreciation for the balance between national security and civil rights. I look forward to a robust hearing in the near future.I voted against Mr. Pompeo when he was nominated for CIA director because of his troubling opposition to closing Guantanamo Bay and his willingness to not only support, but expand, the bulk collection of innocent Americans' personal information.I intend to press Director Pompeo on how he views America's role in the world. I want to know whether he recognizes the role of the State Department in promoting human rights and democracy around the world, and how that strengthens U.S. national security here at home.Secretary Tillerson's firing is symptomatic of @POTUS' inability to take independent advice from his advisors.

While Secretary Tillerson and I may have disagreed on many policy issues, he gave the president an unvarnished look at the realities and importance of diplomacy. https://t.co/kq17JFrN0bPublic schools, and the educators who run them, fill a critical and unique role in our country: they teach and shape the next generation of Americans. #PublicSchoolsWeek reminds us that such a tremendous responsibility must always be met with adequate resources and support.Today we start the celebration of #PublicSchoolsWeek. Public schools serve 9 in 10 students nationally while nearly 900,000 Maryland students receive a quality, public education each day across our state. https://t.co/94zS5zb5koThanks to @MizMaryland for sitting down with me this week to discuss family, faith, and the importance of community and civic engagement in these challenging times. You can listen to our conversation here: https://t.co/OM7Jlyi3yW …Couldn't agree more with this headline. The #ChesapeakeBay is a natural wonder and the lifeblood of Maryland's economy. We treasure it. And our cleanup efforts are working, but for them to continue working, "a sustained federal commitment is essential."

https://t.co/q6pyFTCLcTWomen deserve to see that gender equality is a basic, founding principle of our society. They deserve an Equal Rights Amendment. This year I will fight with renewed purpose and conviction to see the #ERA adopted. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/rOF4KOgmDhThis #WomensHistoryMonth I'm calling on my Senate colleagues to remove the deadline for ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. We're just two states shy of finally, expressly prohibiting gender discrimination in the Constitution – broadening women's legal toolbox substantially. https://t.co/8LyXK5BfumProud to be working with my House colleagues @RosLehtinen and @GerryConnolly to improve the diversity of our national security workforce. America's diversity is one of our greatest assets as a nation, and our national security agencies should reflect that. https://t.co/aT1tiAa73UThe students from Parkland, FL are still fighting for #GunSafety, and I stand with them – for the 17 lives lost in Parkland, and the innocent lives lost each day in Baltimore and cities around the country. Gun violence is wreaking havoc on our communities. It's time for action. https://t.co/pIr8CVtwztI recently sat down with @MizMaryland to discuss family, faith, our uniquely challenging political climate, and the importance of community and civic engagement. You can listen here: https://t.co/OM7JlyzEXw  

Thank you for a thoughtful conversation, @heathermizeur.#InternationalWomensDay is an appropriate time to remind my Senate colleagues that @POTUS' reinstatement and expansion of the #GlobalGagRule denies millions of women around the world access to health care, endangering their lives.

We must end the #GlobalGagRule once and for all. https://t.co/HDSrs4hyddToday we celebrate #InternationalWomensDay and the unbreakable spirit of women across the globe.

This year we watched the rise of a more equitable social order with the #MeToo movement, as scores of women gave us all a lesson in bravery. We must meet that bravery with our own. https://t.co/HbjaA8VK30.@POTUS' charade of an #infrastructure "plan" spent more effort gutting environmental laws than investing in ways to modernize our transportation systems. Our plan? Invests $115 billion to modernize our water and sewer systems without sacrificing clean water protections. https://t.co/yhaEl5Bqe4This is a strong, honest #infrastructure proposal that provides meaningful support for rebuilding and maintaining our roads, bridges and drinking water systems. And in stark contrast to @POTUS' "plan," it doesn't add a trillion dollars to our deficit.

https://t.co/bnMtD1PpHpHappening now: a critical conversation on gun violence and how we can better protect our children. Grateful to Prince George's County Police Chief Hank Stawinski and Baltimore teacher Katrina Kickbush for offering their important perspectives. #GunSafety

https://t.co/qNz3EYwsyCPeople enter public service for different reasons, but in every case, it's an honorable opportunity to work to better your community – locally, regionally, and nationally. Evidently @POTUS has yet to understand the concept of putting our country first.

https://t.co/iKZvQemw3z.@MikeBloomberg understands the challenge of mitigating #ClimateChange also brings opportunities for economic growth and innovation. He's a great choice for @UN Special Envoy for ClimateAction and will help represent USA’s true interest in fighting climate change. #WeAreStillInI was with Lizandro and Diego at an #immigration round table shortly before they were deported. They were bright, promising young men heading to college on full scholarships. And this was their home.

I'm still fighting for a #DreamActNow, for them and the thousands like them. https://t.co/tIV4icfjU3#Dreamers were brought here as children. For the vast majority, the US is the only home they know.

TPS recipients are legal immigrants. They came here seeking refuge from tragedy &amp; a better life.

I'm not giving up on protecting them until the job is done. #DreamActNow #SaveTPSTomorrow – March 5 – is the deadline @POTUS created for #DACA recipients to leave the country when he rescinded the program, putting 800,000 lives at risk of forced deportation.

Congress cannot wait for the courts to decide their fate. We must act. We must pass a #DreamActNow.Tomorrow is the deadline @POTUS imposed on #DACA, when thousands lose their legal status.
 
I haven't forgotten. The courts may still be hearing the issue, effectively delaying the deadline. But Congress must still act. Dreamers are living in limbo &amp; that is wholly unacceptable.The fact that heavily trained New York City police officers are only able to hit their targets 18% of the time during active shooter situations should forever end the debate on arming school teachers. #GunSafety 

https://t.co/1eN8ZMMuPY#ReadAcrossAmericaDay is also Dr. Seuss' birthday. So today, I am reminded of one of my favorite Dr. Seuss quotes from one of his best books.

You. Me. All of us together – we must continue to care about each other and the world around us. That is the only way we will progress. https://t.co/CaHgHHtFckWishing every family and classroom a happy #ReadAcrossAmericaDay! A day to celebrate the joy of reading and of sharing that joy with our children. The next great adventure is always just a page turn away.

What are you reading with your kids today?The Bay Journal is a unique, highly trusted publication that serves an essential function in the #ChesapeakeBay restoration effort. I appreciate EPA’s willingness re-evaluate its decision and correct course. https://t.co/CP2kP5UnkxIt's been 2 weeks since the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and the students, brave as ever, are still speaking out. They aren't taking "no" for an answer.

Nor should they.

This carnage must end, and we are the ones who must help end it. #GunSafety https://t.co/5HuSEzuZgOFor more than a decade, it's been understood that the @FBI needs a new campus facility to meet its growing security and staff needs. Now, suddenly, the proposal is to rebuild the J. Edgar Hoover Building, even though that may wind up costing more and being less secure.

Why? https://t.co/gCASz4DZduToday I demanded answers from @USGSA and @FBI as to why there's been a sudden, wholesale change of direction regarding a new FBI headquarters.

The men and women of the FBI deserve adequate facilities to carry out their important work. But that effort is being majorly mishandled. https://t.co/Vl5KQXKuD2Thank you, @LCVoters. The Chesapeake Bay is the treasure and economic engine of Maryland. I'm proud to fight for it, and all the jobs across the country that depend on the health and preservation of our natural resources. Let's keep up that fight in 2018. #LCVScorecard https://t.co/0BvcqMbt1N
