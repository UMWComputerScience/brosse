I couldn‚Äôt do it alone! Thanks to everyone who came out today to say loudly and clearly: #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/XNlc19htiyAs a dad, I know one thing for sure: moms and dads will do anything to keep their kids safe. We should be helping these families, not ripping them apart. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/KwJVWvZs3jSomeone once said you can‚Äôt be everywhere at once. But that someone didn‚Äôt have almost half a million miles on their Chrysler Town and Country minivan! https://t.co/qczexLcMIBDonald Trump thought this fight was over when he signed his Executive Order ten days ago. 

Look around, @POTUS. 

We‚Äôre just getting started. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch https://t.co/nysW1ZcVhkThe First State is filled with good neighbors. This country is filled with good neighbors. We need to be good neighbors to the families who are simply seeking safety and a better life for their kids. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch https://t.co/yiONV1fXGxStarted this day of action at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church. It‚Äôs a beautiful day to stand up for what‚Äôs right! #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/DIFK0WIA9hOver the last week, these organizers rallied our communities so that we could stand together and send a clear message to @POTUS: #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/J9THHAx4gaThese are the kind of smart investments - designed with the input of local stakeholders - that are included in a bipartisan Water #Infrastructure bill I co-authored that‚Äôs making its way through the Senate: America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. https://t.co/a9z4UzX2GFI enjoyed checking on the progress of critical beach renourishment efforts on Bethany, South Bethany and Fenwick beaches  - federally-backed projects that I was proud to help bring to Delaware after terrible storms in recent years. https://t.co/rlVzBsa3pzJust a few #FarmBill18 wins: 

üêî Gives poultry farmers better access to conservation funds

üçÖ Creates new initiatives to make fruits and vegetables more affordable 

‚ôªÔ∏è Contains zero provisions that weaken environmental protections 

ü•¶ Provides funding for organic researchFrom improving SNAP and expanding crop insurance, to fighting the opioid epidemic and preserving support for conservation programs, the #FarmBill18 shows that when we work together, we can achieve bipartisan wins across the boardEvery day, reporters risk their lives to bring us the news. But a newsroom shouldn‚Äôt ever feel like the front lines. How can we live in a country where our fellow citizens, by simply getting up and going to work, fall victim to such senseless tragedies? #EnoughWhen we talk about the Supreme Court, we often talk about precedent. Senator McConnell willingly chose to set a new precedent with his partisan blockade of Merrick Garland. The Senate should also wait until after the election before considering any nominee to fill this vacancyThe next Supreme Court justice will be the 'swing vote' on issues that impact every single American:
 
- voting rights
- reproductive rights
- civil rights
- workers' rights
- LGBTQ rights
- access to clean air and safe drinking water
 
The American people should get a say.Among the First State victories in the 2018  #FarmBill is an amendment secured by @ChrisCoons and I ‚Äì giving Delaware farmers better access to conservations funds that will help them improve operations on their farms and protect our land and drinking water
https://t.co/MJWfCVF7CTFirst State farmers make a small state like Delaware an agricultural powerhouse - #1 in the nation for value of products per acre. For consumers and the thousands of Delawareans growing crops and raising livestock every day, the bipartisan 2018 #FarmBill delivers major wins.Merrick Garland was treated shamefully. It will be a long time before many of us forget that. https://t.co/am9UxegamyOnly by addressing the underlying conditions in Central America - violence, corruption and lack of economic opportunity - can we end the crisis that leads so many to flee to our southern border. Today, @SenateDems announced our plan to do just that https://t.co/DW1QHqb0pWThree years ago today, love won when #SCOTUS ruled that #MarriageEquality was finally the law of land. We‚Äôve come a long way, but our fight to end discrimination against our LGBTQ family and friends must continue. #EqualityForward https://t.co/qfsG3mJxUxUnfortunately, the shameful and unprecedented obstruction that my Republican colleagues mounted in 2016 against Judge Merrick Garland has led to many deeply flawed decisions by the Supreme Court, including discriminatory policies like this #MuslimBan being upheld todayDespite today‚Äôs disappointing ruling, the facts remain the same: denying a group of people entry to this country on the sole basis of their religion and nationality is uninformed, un-American and unwise. Do not be fooled. This policy does not make our country safer.Today, a majority of the Supreme Court mistakenly ignored what @POTUS himself has plainly told us time and time again -- this travel ban was born out of fear and hostility toward Muslims rather than any sort of national security strategy. #NoMuslimBanEverThis #NationalGIBillWeeek, it is imperative that we renew our commitment to making sure every veteran gets the most out of their hard-earned G.I. Bill benefits https://t.co/9damtNYVopSince 1944, millions of veterans have used their G.I. Bill benefits to improve their lives and their futures.  I would not be where I am today, without #MyGIBill. It allowed me to pursue a Masters Degree at @UDelaware in my pursuit to continue serving the American people74 years ago today, President Roosevelt signed the #GIBill, one of the most groundbreaking pieces of legislation in the history of our country. It changed millions of lives ‚Äì including my own ‚Äì by spurring economic opportunity and helping to create the middle class as we know itLocated at the end of 'America's tailpipe,' First State families are forced to breathe dirtier air from upwind states and now @EPA wants to deny Delaware's request to cut this pollution.

The Golden Rule urges us to treat others the way we want to be treated. And we have a moral obligation to address the violence migrants are fleeing in their home countries ‚Äì an obligation that @POTUS must also recognizeThis morning, I had the chance to join leaders and activists of all faiths who are understandably concerned about the humanitarian crisis at our border. https://t.co/Qy4RWleKGaHey @EPAScottPruitt, no need to waste taxpayer dollars on whatever "tactical polos" are. Happy to give you some tips on some very affordable, yet stylish polo options https://t.co/ex81mvzYwmI again call on @POTUS to use his authority to unequivocally end his ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy and stop traumatizing families.What‚Äôs more, the Administration‚Äôs failure to appropriately process asylum claims, and the extreme limits they have placed on asylum, means that families arriving at our border cannot go through the legal channels.Unfortunately, his ‚Äúsolution‚Äù of detaining families arriving at our borders indefinitely without due process is almost as harmful‚Äîand has already been found illegal by the courts.It only took 44 days, the ire of the world and irreversible trauma inflicted on over 2,300 innocent children for @POTUS to reverse his own despicable policy. https://t.co/RypN7N8IapIt was a pleasure to meet with Delaware advocates of all ages from the @alzassociation.

Period. https://t.co/48szQ9YnfrWe have a moral obligation to do far more to address the unimaginable violence in Central America that is causing families to flee their homes. Continuing to address the symptoms of the problem, rather than its root causes, ensures that we are complicit in their miseryI‚Äôm disappointed @USAGSessions appears not to have read Matthew 25, which calls us to welcome strangers in our land. What's happening at our borders right now isn't consistent with Matthew 25 or the teachings of any faith. The administration must end this heartbreaking policy nowShame on those who dare to give lip service to #WorldRefugeeDay while simultaneously condoning -- either explicitly or with their silence -- a policy that rips apart families that are fleeing unspeakable violenceToday, a record 70 million people worldwide are in need of refuge. The Trump Administration has all but stalled acceptance of those who need our help the most. Far from making our country safer, this policy jeopardizes our ability to lead with moral clarityScripture calls us "to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners." We should recommit ourselves to that calling on #WorldRefugeeDay‚Äîand strive to live it out every single day of the yearI‚Äôm proud that every one of my Democratic colleagues has signed onto the bill ‚Äì but so far, not one Republican has joined.

I implore my Republican colleagues who say they oppose this inhumane policy: cosponsor this bill.

As a father, I can't imagine the pain felt by so many fathers, and mothers, whose children are being ripped away after they have already fled unspeakable violence and are simply seeking a better life for their kidsThis isn't happening somewhere halfway around the world. This is a reality in the United States of America right now, and it is shameful. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/vRveLhCeynThe concerns surrounding Pruitt‚Äôs endless scandals aren‚Äôt partisan. Time to hold @EPAScottPruitt accountable to the American public who he serves. https://t.co/ADtB6nSLJICourts prove again that Pruitt isn‚Äôt doing his job to protect downwind states like Delaware. This month, Pruitt‚Äôs @EPA proposed to rejected 4 petitions from DE seeking to reduce emissions from upwind states -- all in favor of, you guessed it: polluters. https://t.co/kNMOxFZSqQAll the more reason Mr. Pruitt should release his public financial disclosure to the American people immediately. The public deserves answers now given all the scandals that keep emerging https://t.co/AzuAzYiQQ5Time to take Scott Pruitt #BacktoBasics: It's illegal to use the power of your office or pressure your employees to help find your wife a job with GOP donors or lobbyists.

That's why I've joined my colleagues to introduce legislation that would keep families from being needlessly ripped apart, which is ‚Äì without a question ‚Äì the right thing to do. https://t.co/e9Cz5gQUGkMatthew 25 calls to care for the least among us, including welcoming strangers in our land. @POTUS, however, is callously choosing to enforce a policy that not only targets vulnerable migrants but also inflicts further trauma by separating children from their parentsIf the Trump Administration succeeds, we would go back to a time when insurers could deny #healthcare coverage to Americans based on their gender or medical history. We all have to keep paying attention and keep fighting to #ProtectOurCareA year ago, @POTUS promised to ‚Äúbeautifully‚Äù protect Americans living with pre-existing conditions. Now, his administration is arguing those critical protections ‚Äì that provide care to as many as 130 million Americans ‚Äì are unconstitutional https://t.co/e1UfA0cbkxGovernor @JohnCarneyDE hits the nail on the head: Delaware does its part to cut emissions, but we need federal action from @EPA to ensure First State families aren‚Äôt threatened by dirty air from other states

It is clear that analysis still holds and that, in the short term, @POTUS is willing to sacrifice our standing in the world for political gain.@POTUS's dangerous obsession with dismantling President Obama‚Äôs legacy puts our national security at risk. It also puts what could be a historic agreement with a far more volatile country like North Korea even further out of reachWith absolutely no alternative deal in place, @Potus's irresponsible and shortsighted decision ultimately increases the odds of armed conflict with Iran, and could needlessly provoke a dangerous arms race in the region.Real leaders don't build themselves up by tearing down others. From the TPP to the Paris Agreement and now with the #IranDeal, @POTUS seems to be solely driven by his desire to tear down good policies simply because they are President Obama's achievements.Pulling out of the #IranDeal - with no replacement in sight - leaves America and our allies less safe and diminishes our credibility as a world leader and an honest partner. I urge @POTUS: don‚Äôt abandon an agreement that is preventing a nuclear armed Iran https://t.co/3Xihgyj65BIt is great news that consumers will know more about what is in the food they‚Äôre ordering. This common sense, bipartisan policy change enhances transparency and allows all Americans to make better-informed decisions 
https://t.co/qRMdIogar3Coastal states like Delaware can‚Äôt afford to have valuable #climatechange information used as a political football by @EPAScottPruitt. @EPA has a responsibility to publish its scientific research ‚Äî not hide behind an ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù notice on its website. https://t.co/XEnWGcJFCaToday, I had the opportunity to meet with the hard working teachers at Sunnyside Elementary School in Smyrna.

And he has opposed efforts to advance the rights of minorities, including women and LGBT people, and has promoted deeply troubling views regarding Muslim AmericansNow, perhaps more than ever, I believe America‚Äôs top diplomat must be an individual who will reassure our allies around the world of America‚Äôs commitment to democracy, humanitarianism and critical international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA)Job Seekers!

On #EarthDay2018, these bedrock laws are under attack by a reckless @EPA AdministratorI am proud to have led the years-long effort to bring a national park to Delaware. With #EarthDay tomorrow, this weekend is a great opportunity to #FindYourPark at one of First State National Historical Park‚Äôs seven locations across Delaware. https://t.co/yieSJEDldBTo celebrate #NationalParkWeek, entry today at all national parks is free. I hope you can #FindYourPark in Delaware and visit our very own First State National Historical Park, with over 1,000 beautiful acres telling the story of Delaware‚Äôs special role in our nation‚Äôs history. https://t.co/NeHBBhEYcpWe should treat every day as #EarthDay, because our actions today, tomorrow and next week all have an impact on the number of asthma attacks in Delaware, the number of schools with tainted water. There‚Äôs always more to do to protect public health and our environmentClearer air. Safer water. These aren‚Äôt just environmental buzz words. For kids in Delaware, the policies we enact as a nation have an impact on their quality of life. There is no excuse for us to abandon our commitment to their health and walk back environmental protections. https://t.co/cQhav8w7s9It was great to join families in Wilmington today to kick off #EarthDay2018 celebrations.

The federal #CleanWaterAct is a vital tool for us to hold upstream polluters accountable. The law has been working for nearly 50 years. We shouldn‚Äôt undermine it now https://t.co/SwNcPSKJG7Efforts to undermine these federal protections aren‚Äôt hypothetical ‚Äì they have real impacts on Delaware‚Äôs ability to hold polluters accountable if they dirty the waters of the Brandywine Creek, for example, which flows from Pennsylvania and provides water to all of Wilmington https://t.co/fztDe695AuYesterday, the EPW Committee held a hearing designed to question rules in the Clean Water Act that have been used by downstream states like Delaware for decades to protect our groundwater from polluters hundreds of miles upstream..@EPAScottPruitt was the wrong choice to lead @EPA last year, and he has absolutely no business running this agency today. https://t.co/I3nk22bYegI have believed that Scott Pruitt was unfit to serve as @EPA Administrator since he was nominated. Over the last year, he has been worse than expected - with dangerous policies, ethical failings, wasteful spending and no accountability to the people whom he is supposed to serve.During his confirmation process, I warned about Mr. Pruitt‚Äôs ‚Äòunacceptably casual approach to meeting obligations as a public servant.‚Äô Unfortunately, that warning fell on deaf ears. Today, I joined 169 of my colleagues in Congress calling on @EPAScottPruitt to resign. https://t.co/eqops7qWP1If it were a private company, @USPS would rank 37th on the Fortune 500. While I can‚Äôt imagine any Fortune 500 company operating with an empty board of directors, today, there are zero Senate confirmed members of the @USPS Board of Governors - Congress must fix this mismanagement https://t.co/7X13oQ52RDThe @LungAssociation‚Äôs 2018 #StateoftheAir report makes plain the need for strong enforcement of the federal #CleanAirAct. Moving backward on clean air efforts isn‚Äôt a boon for our economy, it is an assault on the health of our families 
https://t.co/3SXBuPUij6For nearly 50 years, the #CleanAirAct has been protecting Delawareans from unaccountable polluters hundreds of miles away. Sadly, President Trump and @EPAScottPruitt are actively working against #cleanair progress, and many of their actions will create more pollution in DelawareUnfortunately, Delaware sits at the end of ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äôs tailpipe.‚Äô 90% of our air pollution comes from other states hundreds of miles away. Despite our best efforts, Delaware can only do so much to improve air quality on our own
https://t.co/LHN7jvvHEbIn just nine years, #RGGI states, including Delaware, have cut power plant emissions in half. Instead of hurting our economy, as opponents would argue, GDP growth in RGGI states continues to outpace the rest of country, while also cleaning up our air.

Adding a controversial question that will likely decrease responses is irresponsible and a waste of taxpayer dollarsOur Constitution, which established the #Census, calls for a counting of all people living in this country -- both citizens and non-citizens.

Adding a politically-motivated citizenship question to #2020Census is another piece of @POTUS' anti-immigrant agendaThe Trump Administration‚Äôs decision to add a question about citizenship to the #2020Census is not only deeply troubling and legally questionable, but also threatens to undermine the accuracy of this critical count https://t.co/QTm3ZcjDfYThe #omnibus spending bill that the Senate passed last week includes an additional $8.5 million for @DelawareDOT to help fund smart projects like this that are good for our economy and safetyBeautiful day for a groundbreaking in Milford!

I hope we can find the places where there is agreement, work together and not squander this opportunity. https://t.co/qG0emXTzCgUnderinvestment in infrastructure isn't just being felt in Blades, Delaware. We all agree that historic infrastructure investments are desperately needed across the country ‚Äì that‚Äôs why candidate Trump‚Äôs call for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending resonated with voters.The @SenateDems #infrastructure proposal unveiled today provides a roadmap for $1 trillion in real investment in drinking and wastewater systems, roads, highways, bridges, ports and waterways, broadband and other critical priorities. https://t.co/5bzR8DMmw8Until we get serious about funding modern drinking water systems across the country, small towns and families will continue to bear both the financial and public health burdens of our inaction. https://t.co/4RqMISK0heUnfortunately, the Trump Administration‚Äôs #infrastructure proposal focuses more on cutting environmental protections ‚Äì like those that address water pollution ‚Äì rather than making the historic investments in our infrastructure we badly need.In Delaware, we've seen that smart investments can dramatically improve our water quality. But states can't tackle this challenge on their own ‚Äì the federal government has an important role to play, too.We had a successful outcome in Blades thanks to everyone‚Äôs hard work. However, if we‚Äôre serious about making lasting progress, we must focus on the root causes of these all-too-common drinking water crises, rather than just addressing the symptoms as they arise.Last month, when water testing in the town of Blades, Delaware showed contamination from PFCs, I was heartened by the all-hands-on-deck effort that came together quickly to provide emergency water supplies and work toward getting the town clean water again.We can either pretend we‚Äôre going to invest in our country‚Äôs #infrastructure, or we can actually do it. @SenateDems have a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that makes real investments in our country and our workers https://t.co/xPmwfjz8OqThe water crisis in Blades was just the tip of the iceberg. Decades of underfunding will lead to more frequent water crises unless Congress does its job and makes real investments. Thank you to the Delaware Rural Water Association for continuing to champion water #infrastructure https://t.co/d7mtHxjt6JPublic servants should be working to enrich the lives of those we serve, not the other way around.

But we weren‚Äôt elected to just tackle the easy things ‚Äì Congress has an opportunity to do something meaningful to address our nation‚Äôs infrastructure needs, and we shouldn‚Äôt squander it.Frankly, the best way to speed up projects is to provide long-term funding and program certainty. Time and time again, the research has shown that inadequate funding is the most common factor delaying water and transportation projects.And gutting environmental protections does not achieve time or cost savings for infrastructure projects. Instead, we should implement the new authorities that Congress has already passed in 2012, 2015 and 2016.We can‚Äôt go from an 80 percent federal share to a 20 percent share and expect states that are already facing budget constraints to pick up the slack.And it‚Äôs hard to take @POTUS's $200 billion proposal seriously when it‚Äôs paired with a budget that would cut $240 billion from existing #infrastructure programs.President Trump's math around infrastructure just doesn't add up. He promised $1 trillion on the campaign trail, but his plans will only generate ~$30 billion. https://t.co/kDEOoa3iHD https://t.co/nNkkWmibPoIt was good to meet with Guatemala‚Äôs Ambassador to the U.S., Manuel Espina, and hear about his country‚Äôs efforts to make Guatemala a better place to live and prosper.

For example, GSA will not tell me whether Trump Hotel buys Trump wine or other Trump products, the sales of which would clearly benefit President Trump financially.Of the nearly 12,000 pages of documents @USGSA provided, only 22 pages directly pertain to the lease. Not a single one of those 22 pages contains the analysis I requested. Instead, there are hundreds of pages about maintenance issues and the location of a Starbucks in the hotel.For over a year, I have asked @USGSA for documents on its determination that the #TrumpHotel lease complies with ethics and conflicts requirements preventing an elected official from being a party to a federal lease or benefiting financially from it. https://t.co/LgmBwfUnFsGreat to talk with leaders in the #EV industry today about how we can continue to work together to make sure our country and our cars are on the cutting edge. https://t.co/jiUoRvaUFQWe need to continue the progress we've already made by ensuring that our tax policies encourage future investments and that our transportation policies provide funding for charging and refueling infrastructure across our country.Our investments in electric and fuel cell vehicles are reducing harmful pollution that contributes to #climatechange, providing economic opportunities here at home and reducing our dependence on foreign oil -- a win-win-win!It‚Äôs always great to talk with @DelStateUniv Interim President Dr. Wilma Mishoe and her predecessor @tmcf_hbcu President Dr. Harry Williams.

The @SpecialOlympics does such important work to educate, empower and build inclusive communities across the country. https://t.co/gvce6qwD4bPresident Trump has the audacity to release his #InfrastructurePlan on the very same day that his #TrumpBudget proposes slashing $240 billion from existing infrastructure programs. Well, the American people aren‚Äôt fooled.We've seen this movie before. The #GOPTaxBill asked middle class Americans to pay for a giveaway to corporations and billionaires. Now, President Trump's #InfrastructurePlan asks cash-strapped states to cover the cost when it comes to funding infrastructure improvements.An #InfrastructurePlan that relies on cities and states that already bear the lion's share of funding obligations for infrastructure is a bad deal, especially for rural states.President Trump can equivocate and talk about leveraging federal dollars, but the math just does not add up. $200 billion is a far cry from the $1 trillion that then-candidate Trump promised, and it's even further from the $1.5 trillion he touted today.On the campaign trail, then-candidate Trump promised a large scale, trillion dollar infrastructure investment. 

After waiting more than a year for President Trump's #InfrastructurePlan, what the White House released today is unrealistic, inadequate and irresponsible.As our nation's top environmental official spends an undisclosed amount of taxpayer dollars to jet set around the world, the #TrumpBudget guts @EPA's funding by 34% ‚Äì that's critical funding that would go toward ensuring all Americans have a safe and healthy environment.After the first reports of @EPAScottPruitt's questionable travel expenses surfaced last year, I asked the @EPAoig to conduct a full audit ‚Äì that investigation now spans all of Administrator Pruitt's travel in 2017.I'm sure that @EPAScottPruitt's $1,600 first-class plane ride from D.C. to New York was comfortable, but he only had to ask and I would've saved him a seat next to me on @Amtrak's Northeast Regional!

I hope @POTUS knows it too. https://t.co/P5Zv1aJA2eGreat to meet with @leagueofcities today and listen to their ideas to #RebuildWithUs. They understand better than most that we need historic investments in our infrastructure‚Äîand we can‚Äôt simply push the burden of funding these projects onto our towns, cities and states. https://t.co/RbOuEkQfk7Hey @EPAScottPruitt, rapidly warming oceans, unpredictable growing seasons and increasingly severe weather events aren't helping us humans. In fact, they're devastating.
https://t.co/0kIkOf5STMRT if you think that science matters. #ClimateChangeIsReal, and that‚Äôs not a good thing for our only Earth and all of its living things. https://t.co/9tI2iQYBzwIf the administration insists on proceeding with this proposal, then it should carve out the cherished Delaware coast, and similar areas along the Atlantic, from any efforts to increase drilling. #ProtectOurCoast https://t.co/LOWm8vFKmDIn Florida, @SecretaryZinke clearly established the standard: If an area yields greater economic value from coastal activities and industries, and local communities are solidly opposed, then those areas should get the same exemption as Florida.It‚Äôs not just Delawareans, or even just Democrats, who acknowledge that increasing drilling off our coasts is the wrong move. Republican governors and lawmakers from states like Georgia and South Carolina have publicly stated their opposition to the Trump Administration‚Äôs plan.It seems to me that the only real difference between Florida and Delaware (and every other coastal state that wasn't lucky enough to get an exemption from Secretary Zinke) is that @POTUS happens to have beachfront properties in Florida.You know who also recognizes that coastal communities could be negatively impacted by offshore drilling? Interior @SecretaryZinke. In fact, that was the exact justification that Secretary Zinke used to carve Florida‚Äôs Gulf coast out of the Trump Administration‚Äôs proposal.Proponents say that offshore drilling brings more economic benefits along the coast‚Äîbut the truth is, our thriving coastal areas receive greater economic benefits from having a healthy and sustainable ocean off their shores.Delaware's coast generates $6.9 billion each year. Our beach communities, including Rehoboth Beach, support 59,000 jobs and $711 million in tax revenue. Our coasts provide more than 10% of our state's total employment, taxes and business production. https://t.co/OFQ9LIGXXtJust eight years ago, with the Deepwater Horizon disaster, we saw that oil spills do not respect state boundaries‚Äîand that the severe environmental and financial costs last for generations.

I'm asking @EPA to explain the missing info on nearly $3 billion in taxpayer dollars: https://t.co/KJwVvaO1HfBut Delaware wasn't the only state that @EPA reported drastic declines in grant funding. Nearly every state showed a decrease of $10, $20, $30 million or more in grants to help clean up their environment and protect public health.In 2017, @EPA reported that Delaware saw a 70% decrease in EPA grant funding for state and local environmental projects - from $26 million in 2016 to just $7 million. These grants go to projects like helping Delaware clean up contaminated sites or improve wastewater treatment.Just met with @NFP_nursefamily, and I agree that long-term funding for #MIECHV is essential for millions of families. https://t.co/X8SVfpRbK0The quality and affordability of care that Americans deserve from their health care system should be above partisan politics.
