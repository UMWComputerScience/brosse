It’s heartening to see this outpouring of support for immigrant families who’ve been impacted by this administration’s cruel policies. The message is clear: #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/9vgJEoYkjiProud to join thousands in Chicago to oppose the Trump Administration’s zero tolerance immigration policy and show that  #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/2MXYqEmeTlEfforts to stifle the freedom of the press cannot be tolerated and #Morocco should reverse this concerning decision.  #freethemallDisappointed with Morocco’s unjust sentencing of journalists, including Hamid Al Mahdaoui of @BadilInfo and Mohamed Al Asrihi of Rif24, to prison simply for covering local protests.I received a briefing yesterday where Trump officials refused to commit to reuniting families. They could not say how many families have been separated and said they only have plans to reunite 10 parents in their custody with children under 5. Outrageous.I just sent a letter to President Trump demanding he commit to comply with binding court order to reunite separated families: https://t.co/kS3zaI06Wl https://t.co/ZfJ9BN0AhHThis humanitarian crisis is far from over – and the Administration has to get its act together and comply with a federal court order to reunite these families #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/APjtglM8tzPlease continue to write and send your #CardsForKids so we can share support and words of encouragement to children seperated at the border from their parents.

Washington, D.C. 20201Met with local education leaders in East St. Louis to discuss efforts to improve early childhood development. I’ve intro’d legislation to address toxic stress &amp; trauma that negatively impacts development and I’m glad to see @EriksonInst working on these issues in East St. Louis. https://t.co/LF7WZwxadsIt was clear from my meeting yesterday that the Administration is working harder to stop the court-ordered reunification of these families than returning the kids. In the well-worn words of President Trump: sad.Calling on the Administration for a public accounting of the progress of reuniting children with their parents. Every day of delay is a bad day for these kids and their parents.Hundreds of infants and toddlers have been taken from their parents by our government, but ICE can only match ten parents to their child as of now. 
 
Cruelty and incompetence at work by the Trump Administration.Senators were briefed by the Trump Administration yesterday about the ongoing migrant crisis at our Southern border. The lack of answers they had for us on basic questions about the well-being and location of children and parents is shocking. https://t.co/dZm51bpBgQDangerous temperatures moving into Illinois today and tomorrow. Take caution and stay hydrated. Here is where you can find a local cooling center:  https://t.co/AAc0K4nU6jIllinoisan Ron Gidwitz was just confirmed by the Senate as the new Ambassador to Belgium. Congratulations to him and his family.Cities and towns across America feel the heavy toll gun violence takes on their community daily. Chicago - a city I’m proud to represent – has suffered greatly from this scourge. The Republican complacency to act on this epidemic has to end.Heartbroken to once again hear of another mass shooting tragedy in America, this time at a newspaper in Annapolis. When will the Republicans who control Congress have the courage to buck the NRA and act on gun safety bills to stop the next shooting?Welcomed Illinois Constituents this morning with @RepCheri to discuss a busy week in Congress. Thanks to all who were able to attend. https://t.co/dBlk4QZISDDemocracy at work here in the lobby outside my office. Trump's zero tolerance child separation policy is an outrage, and these Americans have had enough #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/LoM6AAgNiwAny meeting with President Putin must begin with “Do not ever interfere in America’s democracy again. We know you did it and I trust the expertise our intelligence community over your word any day.”Russia attacked American democracy, so naturally President Trump wants to visit with Putin and kiss the ring. Disrespecting our NATO allies and flattering our enemies is a terrible strategy for American foreign policy. https://t.co/NPD2QtJBQJJoining the @Morning_Joe panel soon to share my thoughts on what's next for #SCOTUS. Tune in.Our police know that detaining families seeking safety is inhumane and cruel and doesn’t make us safer. The process at our Southern border must be orderly and caring, and align with our American values #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/nS3zCLEki8#CardsForKids is a small but powerful gesture you can do to show children separated from their parents at the border we are thinking about them.

Washington, D.C. 20201Glad HHS answered @SenateDems request by taking this important step for the health and well being of these children. We need full transparency about what’s happening under Trump's “zero tolerance” policy #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/TytvgoYKnWJoining @CNNSitRoom shortly to discuss Justice Kennedy’s retirement, and why the Senate should not consider a replacement until the American people have spoken in this year’s election (aka the McConnell standard).Good call. https://t.co/zxuRWa5oILMy full statement on Justice Kennedy's retirement: https://t.co/f7T8g2UuAFWith so much at stake for the people of our country, the U.S. Senate must be consistent and consider the President’s #SCOTUS nominee once the new Congress is seated in January.The way we treat the people at our borders is a message to the world.

Washington, D.C. 20201Wondering what you can do to support children who have been separated from their parents at the border? Take a small part of your day to send a card with kind words and encouragement to these children #CardsForKids. https://t.co/8JiLsQcimp#OTD 3 years ago, love won. But we can’t ever stop fighting for full equality. LGBTQ people continue to face discrimination simply for being who they are. That’s wrong, and I’m proud to support federal protections that will ensure love always wins. https://t.co/ouzK5QZ4lXThe Senate has already voted to #SaveTheInternet. The House should act now. Tell @SpeakerRyan to stop the delay.#NetNeutrality means consumers — not big corporations— choose what websites and applications we see online. In the 21st century, access to a free and open internet isn’t a just privilege, it’s a right. I’m fighting to #SaveTheInternet to protect that right.The Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy has created a humanitarian and health crisis that they now have a moral obligation to solve. I’m asking HHS for more info on the health and well-being of separated children, and when they’ll be reunited with their parents.I agree with Justice Sotomayor: this decision fails to safeguard the principle of religious neutrality embedded in our Bill of Rights. History will not be kind to this president’s policies or the #SCOTUS Justices who lent their names to this troubling ruling. https://t.co/pw3ZuFiUK7Rafael has braved decades of harassment and prosecution to expose corruption and human rights abuses in his native #Angola.

Washington, D.C. 20201This morning I stopped by @ElValorChicago where kids were making cards to send to children who’ve been separated from their parents at the border. #Cardsforkids is a small but meaningful gesture that can brighten the day of a child in need. https://t.co/lfAcmpUQQ9As of today, more than 2,000 children remain separated from their parents.

Also as of today, the President has continued to verbally attack immigrants and demand deportations without due process. He lacks the compassion to help solve the humanitarian crisis he created.Beautiful day for the 49th annual #PrideParade in Chicago! https://t.co/48LtEYqjXpHuge turnout of my fellow immigrants in support of reuniting children with their parents immediately.

RT to spread the word #cardsforkidsWhile visiting these children, I delivered handwritten letters and cards from Chicago-area kids and families to show them they are not alone. It was a small gesture that meant a lot to these kids who have been through so much. #cardsforkids https://t.co/vkuRHCBFcqToday I visited a shelter in Chicago housing immigrant children who have been separated from their parents because of the Trump Administration’s zero tolerance policy. This heartbreaking situation has only been further complicated by Trump’s Executive Order. https://t.co/Tq2LHbvhh3Great to attend the opening of Farm on Ogden today. This unique partnership between @chicagobotanic and @LawndaleHealth will provide programs for farming and job training, while also bringing more fresh produce to the Lawndale community. https://t.co/RZhjg7x8RJThere is no denying the beauty and tranquility of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Not one oil drill should be used on this land. https://t.co/DJmtSGB60FWhere is the plan from the Trump Administration to reunite these children with their parents? President Trump created this humanitarian crisis—he hasn’t solved anything. https://t.co/T0eecghsFY"16 and Alone, Inside a Center for Separated Children in New York" https://t.co/P1pVlNmdA0Trump’s enablers in Congress say they support his zero-tolerance policy to “protect” kids from dangerous journey to our border. But last year Trump shut down Central American Minors program that allowed kids to file for asylum without traveling to US: https://t.co/iWv27tb862Don’t be fooled. If you carefully read this executive order, there is no guarantee children can't be separated from their families. This crisis is far from over. https://t.co/Kx9WlzcuqdThe Senate Appropriations Committee just passed my amendment with @SenatorLeahy that will deny U.S. visas to any Pakistani official involved in the imprisonment of Aasiya Noreen, known as Asia Bibi, who was sentenced to death for blasphemy. She must be released.Good news for main street businesses in IL &amp; across US: #SCOTUS has cleared the way for our retailers to compete on a level playing field with internet giants.

Thousands of families are still separated with no plan to reunite them.
 
“Zero tolerance” is still official U.S. policy.
 
Trump’s new order seeks to indefinitely detain children &amp; families.
 
Your voices are still needed. RT to spread the word.Sat down with top U.S. diplomats Todd Robinson and Brian Naranjo this afternoon. Both were expelled from Venezuela on trumped up charges following last month’s sham election. We cannot ignore the humanitarian crisis and dismantling of democracy under President Maduro.The President’s executive order didn’t solve this crisis. https://t.co/lWMZyfDy6XPresident Trump and his enablers in Congress have taken these children hostage to try to enact their anti-immigrant agenda into law. Don’t be fooled: this crisis does not need a bill to fix it—it requires the GOP to stand up and call for an end to this monstrous Trump policy.My full statement here: https://t.co/jwLSR0QN10Make no mistake: the President is doubling down on his ‘zero tolerance’ policy. His new Executive Order criminalizes asylum-seekers and seeks to indefinitely detain their children.Good luck @RepCheri and all the players in tonight’s @CWSoftballGame! https://t.co/AoUtC3x9tVRefugees who are fleeing war, violence, and persecution deserve our compassion, not vilification #WorldRefugeeDay #RefugeesWelcome #WithRefugeesThis is a hostage crisis. Babies and preschoolers are torn from their parents, and right now Republican senators are figuring out how much they can extort in Congress instead of telling the President to simply stop. https://t.co/ohvqyMff4NPay attention here: Republicans are using children separated from their parents, crying in cages, to see how many other pieces of their agenda they can get. Trump could end this policy all by himself before lunchtime: https://t.co/x798tTxL8M“Ted Cruz hasn’t suddenly grown a heart. His proposed bill is an attempt to convert nationwide disgust with family separation into dangerous, anti-immigrant legislation.” https://t.co/04C7RAwYYXThe Trump Administration can try to hide the faces of these separated children and their grief stricken mothers, but it won’t work. We’ve seen enough. We know enough. They cannot hide this cruel reality #KeepFamiliesTogether.**Don’t’ be fooled**
this bill actually strips protections from vulnerable children who have been separated from their parents at the border, making it easier to detain and deport them. This is a bait and switch—Sen. Cruz should tell the President to stop family separation TODAY https://t.co/S221OvC2TPTo my Republican colleagues: Be unafraid of what Breitbart will say tomorrow. Be unafraid what right-wingers’ are going to do to you in the next primary. If you truly believe family separation is reprehensible and shameful, have the courage to stand up to this President.The President doesn’t need a bill to end the suffering.

Watch live here: https://t.co/Kp7VCgUgm4We can’t stop now. We must continue to fight for @NIH and Alzheimer’s research funding, on behalf of families across Illinois and the nation.Almost every American family has been touched by Alzheimer’s, with more than 5 million people nationwide diagnosed with the disease. Over the past three years, Congress has done its part by tripling funding for Alzheimer’s disease research at the National Institutes of Health.Today I met with Illinois members of the @alzassociation to talk about ways Congress can help support efforts to find a cure, develop treatments, and support caregivers who are on the front lines caring for loved ones living with this terrible disease.The White House is trying to play the blame game for its own policy of separating children from their parents—they’re not fooling anybody. https://t.co/gCYN5cdF2YMomentum continues to build for bipartisan #CJreform bill in the Senate. Read new letter from @TheRAC – the faith community believes meaningful reform must fix drug sentencing laws. https://t.co/yvTGOKfKBwStudent debt in America is a crisis. It hits communities of color particularly hard and is exacerbated by Secretary DeVos’ policies. https://t.co/1mhqO6EjvpRepublicans control the Senate by only two votes, so if just two Republicans refused to vote for Trump nominees until the Administration stops separating families, this policy would quickly end.No law requires children to be ripped away from their parents. This cruel policy would end today if the Republicans who control Congress demanded it.Again, for anyone watching this press conference, the Trump Administration is choosing to separate children from their parents at the border. It is false to say they are "just enforcing the laws as they are written"👇 https://t.co/K9Ixk1DhxxCC: President Trump, Attorney General Sessions, and Secretary Nielsen. https://t.co/H5ZIrW4vtjPresident Trump continues to blame Democrats for family separation at the border. Let's get the facts straight: 

AG Sessions and President Trump made this decision. It's false to say there's a law they're enforcing. They could end this cruelty if they so desire.When will the Republicans who control Congress join in this condemnation? https://t.co/Tb42hHlcJkThis extreme family separation policy will only stop when Republicans who control Congress demand it.“The really devastating thing was that we all knew what was going on with this child. We all knew what the problem was,” Kraft said. “She didn’t have her mother, and none of us can fix that.” https://t.co/RNDWTOkcVTElizabeth was a talented journalist and I always enjoyed sitting down for an interview with her.

This @USDA funded program ensures that kids from all income levels have access to nutritious meals when school is not in session. https://t.co/lywrzwVZtfRepublicans are hurrying to confirm 37-year-old Trump judicial nominee Patrick Wyrick, a Scott Pruitt protégé, before finding out if the American Bar Association considers him qualified. Why? #CourtsMatter. https://t.co/mLiPywDjBiWhen will Republicans in Congress stand for family values and call on the Trump Administration to end this monstrous policy? https://t.co/QfxeJcN8kQ1. There is no law requiring family separation. 
2. President Trump could end this policy today if he so desired. 
3. Republicans control Congress.
4. They could bring up &amp; pass @SenFeinstein’s bill that is sponsored by 40 @SenateDems and would end family separation. https://t.co/ibJXzyWReVFamily separation wasn’t U.S. policy until President Trump and AG Sessions made it one. No law requires it. Those are the facts. https://t.co/ZPPrqelpIMBy requiring drug companies to tell us their prices and cracking down on gimmicks used to reduce competition, two bipartisan measures I’ve supported,  we can create a more transparent and affordable system for consumers: https://t.co/wayZst8EnsVisited @OSFHealthCare in Peoria today to discuss new efforts to combat skyrocketing prescription drug costs and critical medicine shortages. https://t.co/U82LEGyh67Farmers in Illinois and across America stand to lose much from President Trump's reckless trade wars. This is not a game -- this is people's livelihoods. https://t.co/yQhDOQOaLZI call on all Republicans &amp; Democrats who care about Dreamers and still believe we are a nation of immigrants to oppose this cruel legislation.Instead, next week he will try to pass partisan legislation that uses Dreamers as hostages to advance the President’s anti-immigrant wishlist. This bill would slash *legal* immigration &amp; fast-track deportations of women &amp; children fleeing horrific gang &amp; sexual violence.If Speaker Ryan had the courage to bring the #DreamAct to the floor of the House it would pass on an overwhelming bipartisan vote. We cannot wait, the time to act is now #DreamActNow.I’ve been urging Republican leaders in Congress to do the right thing by these kids and pass the bipartisan #DreamAct. It’s the only way to protect these talented students, teachers, nurses, and a whole host of others who love this country as much as anyone.In September of last year, President Trump made the cruel decision to end #DACA. Now, 800,000 Dreamers face deportation to countries they have never known.On this day 6 years ago President Obama established #DACA. This program gave young immigrants the chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they’ve ever called home.With dangerously high temperatures expected throughout Illinois this weekend, make sure you’re staying cool and hydrated. Find a cooling center near you here: https://t.co/AAc0K4nU6jOTD in 1777 the Second Continental Congress adopted the flag of this great nation. Happy #FlagDay to all! 🇺🇸Another reason you should be paying attention to this court case. It’s shameful the Trump Administration has chosen to continue its dismantling of the ACA - a law that helped millions of people gain access to insurance - by any means necessary. https://t.co/siTNJsn2ZmMy statement on Justice Department IG Report on FBI handling of the Clinton investigation: https://t.co/SbhsjxB5ncToday, I’m joining thousands of mothers, fathers, grandparents, and others in more than 60 cities across America to declare that #FamiliesBelongTogether. President Trump and AG Sessions are tearing children from their parents, and it has to stop @familiesbelong.I oppose any effort that would strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The #ACA ended this form of discrimination, but President Trump is trying to bring it back. I stand with everyone trying to #ProtectPatientsNow.Junk plans hurt people with pre-exiting conditions, unfairly raise prices on older Americans, and lack essential and basic benefits. It’s time for the Trump Administration to stop promoting these health insurance plans that are raising costs on everyone.I’m pressing @usedgov for answers and to restart work to create basis for relief for additional Corinthian students and students defrauded by other #4profit schools.Secretary DeVos and the Trump Administration have no interest in providing relief to defrauded student borrowers, relief they are legally entitled to. https://t.co/0H48tpoDzuWishing a happy 243rd birthday to the @USArmy today. Thanks to all the women and men who have answered the call of duty and put on the Army uniform throughout our country’s history.Glad the court sided with the interests of consumers in keeping the CFPB’s payday lending rule in place, and against Mr. Mulvaney’s efforts to help predatory lenders continue to trap financially vulnerable Americans in never-ending debt cycles. 
https://t.co/RMUyDDEEJWWondering why your premiums are going up?

Now the American people and our allies deserve serious negotiations and results.It is better for the leaders of nations with nuclear weapons to exchange positive words than hurl insults. But the meeting in Singapore did not produce an agreement, nor any credible plan to remove the nuclear threat from the Korean Peninsula.I pressed the Trump Administration to stop taking the Russian threat lightly as we head into midterm elections. We have to use every tool at our disposal to ensure our democracy isn’t hacked again. https://t.co/LoDRjPxpgCJoining @SenFeinstein soon to discuss our bill that will ban the Trump Administration from separating small children from their parents at our border.

President Trump wants to shrink these national treasures.#OTD 112 years ago, the #AntiquitiesAct was signed by President Roosevelt &amp; since used to create over 150 national monuments.

They don’t seem to care that taxpayer $$ are being wasted, as long as those $$ are going into their friends’ pockets.In her latest move, Sec. DeVos has dismantled the Enforcement Unit that was set-up in 2016 to prevent future fraud by for-profit colleges.

https://t.co/jxsXzXRrNOEvery day President Trump waits to take action on Rx drugs adds to the significant financial burden facing Americans and threatens patients' health. We don’t need vague speeches, we need action. Right now, he’s breaking his promise.Instead, he’s continued to side with big pharma companies that price gouge and markup Rx drug prices. If pharma industry executives support your plan to lower Rx drug costs, you’re not going to fix anything.President Trump took office 16 months ago and in that time, Rx drug prices have continued to skyrocket. His administration hasn’t take one action to help Americans struggling with these high costs.He pledged to take on drug companies to help lower Rx drug prices, but he hasn’t even come close to doing that. Instead, he lined the pockets of big pharma CEO’s with a giant tax break last year.Ahead of the President’s speech on Rx drug pricing, let’s remember what candidate Trump promised the American people…A tip for @SpeakerRyan if he really wants to protect Dreamers.

Good luck to all the athletes! https://t.co/fs8Sb3XLhyForcibly separating young children from their parents who are fleeing persecution is cruel. I stand with @AmerAcadPeds and @AAPPres today in calling for an end to this terrible practice #ProtectFamilies.Great to be at the opening of Sip of Hope – a new Chicago coffee shop that is dedicating all its profits to suicide prevention efforts https://t.co/PbNjx5HRBII wrote to @Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kywa Soe Oo, who have been unjustly imprisoned in Myanmar for documenting the ongoing genocide against the Rohingya. Every day they spend in a cell is an attack on freedom of the press and expression in Burma. https://t.co/elThiPal3IStopped by @C2CChicago today to see some of the great work this organization is doing to provide clothing and other essentials to children in need. https://t.co/E5v5CozJzcSpoke at @NEIU’s conference this morning about improving minority representation in STEM fields. Along with scholarships, we need mentoring programs and innovative partnerships. https://t.co/3Fi2Uo9dBWMorning read from @WashingtonPost: "Teacher of the Year hands Trump messages from young immigrants, hopes he reads them” https://t.co/09V5Cg2mUxFour out of five heroin users report that their addiction began with a prescription for opioids.  We need to look at the upstream factors causing this crisis, like drug companies that flood the market with 14 billion opioid tablets a year.Visited @RFUniversity today to talk with pharmacy students about the importance of responsible opioid prescribing. I’ve intro’d legislation to improve oversight and training to help prevent opioid over-production and over-prescribing. https://t.co/gHQDYoQyE2.@SenDuckworth and I are urging Gov. Rauner to get serious about implementing the changes he’s recommending for IVH Quincy. Items in his plan of action have long been suggested as necessary, but veterans and staff at IVH Quincy can’t wait any longer for him to act and lead.This lawsuit again raises serious unanswered questions about whether the Trump Administration is conspiring with Texas and other states to undermine DACA. My letter to AG Sessions here: https://t.co/vC6iA6GMP9 https://t.co/jHV70ffoPaHappy to help kick off @UChicago’s month-long celebration of innovation and entrepreneurial discoveries. It’s a priority of mine to ensure that the federal government continues to invest in research that helps America create jobs in the industries of tomorrow. https://t.co/p39bmybj1AIt seems that Governor Rauner’s Administration was busy playing political games instead of finding a solution to the deadly Legionnaires’ outbreaks for veterans and staff at IVH Quincy. https://t.co/sx0mKgaUWBThanks to @UofStFrancisfor hosting me today to discuss the importance of restoring #netneutrality rules for a free and open internet. https://t.co/af3y81st77Republicans like to say that “Obamacare is in a death spiral.” The only way that’s the case is because the Trump Administration and Republicans have had their hands around its throat.Last year, I released a study showing the Trump Administration’s deliberate efforts to undermine the ACA and the impact of this sabotage on patients and families across Illinois https://t.co/15RmtfaenVEven Pres. Trump’s former health secretary admitted today that GOP sabotage will raise costs and throw Americans off their health insurance https://t.co/maT3h4Tdz6
