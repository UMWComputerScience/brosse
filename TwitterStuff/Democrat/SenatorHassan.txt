During my time as governor, we came together across party lines to establish &amp; reauthorize Medicaid expansion because it was right for the health &amp; well-being of Granite Staters &amp; for our economy. I thank the General Court and Governor Sununu for continuing this important programLast week, the EPA held a community engagement event in NH, Granite Staters spoke out, raising their concerns about PFAS chemicals in their drinking water. We are calling on Scott Pruitt to address their concerns and take immediate action to protect people from these chemicals. https://t.co/Czl2WFY1RSJune's Granite Stater of the Month, Retired Air Force Master Sergeant Lee Hirtle, decided he wanted to honor veterans who have passed, so he dusted off an old trumpet and taught himself to play "Taps."

Once again people have been murdered in a senseless act of mass gun violence -- and yet again we say enough. It is beyond time to act to combat gun violence in our country.Separating children from their families is outrageous and cruel. I’m pleased that the Office of Inspector General of @HHSGov heeded our calls and announced they will conduct a comprehensive review of HHS’s handling of President Trump's family separation policy. https://t.co/jfAPV0RxzUProtections for pre-existing conditions are critical for millions to get the care they need. With the Trump Administration supporting a lawsuit that would get rid of these protections and a vacancy on the Supreme Court, now more than ever we must fight for Americans' health care. https://t.co/cLCfFYW5WoThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve Chief Willard as U.S. Marshal for New Hampshire. Chief Willard has spent his career working to keep our communities in New Hampshire safe and I look forward to continuing to work together to address the challenges facing our state.I'm proud to support this bill and stand with my colleagues in the fight to protect public workers’ right to collectively bargain. https://t.co/yHHvQxvAzkThere are still more than 2,000 children separated from their parents as a result of President Trump's cruel policy of forced separation. They must be immediately reunited with their families. https://t.co/ocIMWy9YafGiven that the current President regularly disregards established  democratic norms and voices contempt for constitutional safeguards, a  strong independent judiciary is more important than ever. https://t.co/KeuO8Zrm9OI believe that Supreme Court nominees should have broad support from both parties and be able to clear a 60-vote threshold. A strong and independent judiciary that is above politics and willing to stop abuses of power is more important than ever.Any nominee for Supreme Court justice must be committed to protecting the rights of all Americans – including the reproductive rights of women – not just focused on protecting corporate special interests and the powerful few.I have seen firsthand the critical importance of career and technical education programs to New Hampshire’s workforce and our economy, and this bipartisan bill takes important steps to expand opportunity and support innovative businesses. https://t.co/zJoSTkKNn8Today’s anti-worker #SCOTUS decision is a victory for corporate special interests and a major blow to hard-working Americans.

https://t.co/XBxOtQh9RjAs a parent of a child who experiences disabilities, I know how hard it must be for the @LittleLobbyists to travel to D.C. to beg the President not to attack their health care. This Administration must stop trying to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/aXzPqTWcjiPresident Trump’s backdoor Muslim ban has always been and remains un-American and as experts have said, makes us less safe. We must strengthen our national security while staying true to the values that make us strong. https://t.co/XZhNBZi6vMMany Granite Staters have advocated for the health and safety of their families and neighbors when it comes to chemicals in their drinking water, I urge everyone to continue voicing those concerns and I urge the EPA to continue to listen to them. https://t.co/4QsGVVmvbnIt is critical that New Hampshire veterans get the care they need and have earned. @SenatorShaheen and I are working to ensure that any realignment of VA facilities protects NH and would not reduce services. https://t.co/uZIrZaVghnDeleting the words won't change the facts: Climate change is real.

But to protect estuaries like the Great Bay and all of our state’s natural resources, we must do more to combat climate change. https://t.co/myEBqPey6GDonald Hall said he was created to “love New Hampshire.” We are so grateful that he shared that love with all of us in poems that inspired, taught, and touched our hearts.

I'm asking Granite Staters to help me fight back again by sharing your stories about what repealing protections for pre-existing conditions means for you.Our health care is under attack — the Trump Administration is trying to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and I need your help.

They must follow through. https://t.co/NAGeIzqVg8Not only did the @EPA withhold a study on the health impacts of #PFAS in drinking water from the public, they are barring some reporters from covering their "summit" on these issues.

Tune in here: https://t.co/hDIcwqDqS5Yesterday, President Trump again spoke about the possibility of firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It is more important than ever that we stand together to protect the rule of law and allow the special counsel to follow the facts wherever they may lead.After 14 years of apologies and promises to do better from Mr. Zuckerberg, it is time that @facebook take concrete steps to address concerns raised about the platform. In today's hearing I'll also be focused on what  Congress can do to protect consumers and our democracy.The average American woman earns 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man. And for many women of color, it is even less. This is unacceptable, it is time for equal pay for all. #EqualPayDayToday marks 55 years since 129 brave sailors lost their lives when the USS Thresher sank off the New England coast. Built in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, New Hampshire will always remember their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/m1gnMxdligThank you for speaking out about the steps we must take to keep our communities, and our children, safe from gun violence. https://t.co/OHISGr7nNEIt is imperative that the Trump Administration works with our international allies to send a strong message to the Assad regime, Iran, and Russia that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and that there will be consequences.Happy General John Stark Day, New Hampshire!

It is time he steps down.I appreciate @Surgeon_General's call for more Americans to carry naloxone but we also need to lower the cost of this life-saving drug. And to truly address the opioid crisis, we need to significantly step up our treatment, prevention, and recovery infrastructure. https://t.co/yVjU4PVHEaCongratulations to @SOS_RCO on the reopening and expansion of your recovery center in Rochester.
