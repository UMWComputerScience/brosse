Instead, the administration is asking ag producers to take a hit when they can least afford it—bad news for ND &amp; more uncertainty for farmersYesterday, the administration announced it’s moving forward w/ $50 billion in tariffs against Chinese goods &amp; causing China to respond w/ the threat of retaliation to impose similar tariffs—escalating a trade war that will hurt North Dakota farmers &amp; ranchers.Proud of the selfless spirit of these 3 ND women working hard to help their communities, like cycling to support cancer research, sponsoring #HeritageDay events &amp; raising money to support those w/ cancer.
