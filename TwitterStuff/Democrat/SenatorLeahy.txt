Wow. Beautiful, and important in this troubling moment. Vermonters today have also strongly added their voices. https://t.co/aNtk1OA727Bless them all. Thanks to them, and you. A sickening time. https://t.co/tmexoslNPgA Vermonter today. The Trump Adminstration's purposeful cruel and cynical family separations must end. Vermonters and other Americans standing and speaking out already are making a difference. 

https://t.co/FPJCwaj9P6Vermonters, with Americans across the nation, know that the Trump family separations are cruel, they are abhorrent, and they violate American ideals. https://t.co/d4WmXEFFcdI made it clear today in my speech today that I am concerned that anyone who passes Pres. Trump’s litmus tests for judges will not be capable of rising above politics and of providing a check against this admin’s many excesses. @VermontLaw @uvmvermont #vt #restorativejusticeI told the @VermontLaw Restorative Justice Conference about the $3m I included in FY 19 funding for a new National Center for Restorative Justice in the Senate markup of Justice Department funding two weeks ago. @uvmvermont #vt #restorativejusticeFor too long, Congress relied on mandatory minimums to ‘solve’ every public safety concern. Yet one-size-fits-all sentencing simply doesn’t work. @VermontLaw @uvmvermont #vt #restorativejusticeI’ve been looking forward to addressing this great audience today at @VermontLaw #RestorativeJustice Conference at @uvmvermont. I’ll be recognizing their important work and talking about efforts to reform sentencing at the national level. #vtNews Backgrounder: Vermont Highlights In The 5-Year Farm Bill Passed Thursday Night By The U.S. Senate https://t.co/4C9ttP2GRnI support this, and I’m a cosponsor of the Senate bill, S.422. https://t.co/cYFlzqx1q4Hello.

Have you been reading my statements and following my comments on Twitter on this? ... https://t.co/sWFaU0IVfjPresident Trump should also reflect on Justice Kennedy’s legacy, and select a nominee who will be a fair-minded, independent jurist. It’s past time for the President to represent ALL Americans, not just a favored few.Pres. Trump should listen to the voices of millions of concerned Americans worried that they are on the verge of losing their hard-fought, hard-won rights.  An extreme candidate who would jeopardize the rights of women, minorities and #LGBT Americans is unacceptable.President Trump should use this time to do what President Obama did: Find a mainstream, consensus nominee who would garner broad bipartisan support. That means #DitchTheList.There is no justification for rushing this process. Every Republican embraced the #McConnellStandard last Congress to allow the American people an opportunity to weigh in so close to an election. We can wait now, just as we did then.I did not agree with many of Justice Kennedy’s opinions, but I respected his willingness to recognize the rights of Americans as equals. This legacy is now at risk. My statement on his retirement: https://t.co/9GlzoHNiv7I support this, and I’m a cosponsor of the Senate bill, S.422.

It makes zero sense to delay civil proceedings to criminally prosecute migrants with no records, who pose no threat, and who are only seeking refuge from unimaginable violence and terror in their home countries.Indefinite incarceration of families is NOT the answer. I condemned incarceration of families during the Obama administration and will do so again now. Proven alternatives exist that are effective, less costly, and infinitely more humane.Today the American people, through their forceful and justified outrage, proved they can drive change even during the Trump administration.  But we must not be fooled: We need to ensure that the 2,500 children already separated are promptly reunited with their families.NEWS from Leahy and @GovPhilScott: President Nominates Retired Essex Police Chief To Be Vermont’s Next U.S. Marshal https://t.co/5qbKdk99dgBREAKING: Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)

Project also includes 30 housing units. https://t.co/xSWKmPEjyFIt is fitting to perform this presentation before Mr. Williams’ family and friends on the #MemorialDayWeekend when we traditionally take this special time to honor those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom. https://t.co/1QfJaOUQwTIt was my honor to help the family of Mulford "Mulfy" Williams obtain the long-overdue Purple Heart &amp; Bronze Star awards, presented by the VT National Guard today. Mr. Williams served as an infantryman supporting the Allied liberation of Europe. https://t.co/hetSPtRpdQNew Funding To Support #Rural Businesses In Senate #Agriculture #Appropriations Bill:  https://t.co/ox565XrGELAppropriations Vice Chair Patrick Leahy Engineers Funding Boost For #Organics In #Agriculture #Appropriations Bill:  https://t.co/lPJuMPsoGQAppropriations Chair Patrick #Appropriations Vice Chair Patrick Leahy Wins Significant Increase In Funding For Economic Development In #Vermont's #Northeast #Kingdom:  https://t.co/YDE7Pmvywi #NEKAppropriations Vice Chair Patrick #Appropriations Vice Chair Patrick Leahy Advances Funding Boost For #Maple Syrup Research In #Agriculture #Appropriations Bill:  https://t.co/ixnnRR7sRw #Vermont #GoldStandardAppropriations Vice Chair Patrick Leahy: Senate #Agriculture #Appropriations Bill Includes $4M In New Funds To Combat #Invasive #Forest Pests:  https://t.co/sM4ASe23Ia#Appropriations Vice Chair Patrick Leahy Leads Effort To Bring Down #SNAP Barriers At Local #Farmers Markets:  https://t.co/MpHsfeMkR0Most Americans don’t realize how Congress has hamstrung #ATF in tracing #guns used in crimes. WATCH THIS INCREDIBLE BRIEF VIDEO &amp; you won’t forget it: https://t.co/E8JK3T0u0X  And here's info on my new bill to fix it: https://t.co/nMweVW0TSp @AMarch4OurLives @SenBillNelsonCongress placed this archaic hurdle on gun traces, under pressure from the gun lobby. Congress needs to fix its mistake. We can's allow special interests to tie the hands of detectives investigating violent crime. That’s why law enforcement and @AMarch4OurLives support my bill.Today I intro'd the Crime Gun Tracing Modernization Act to remove absurd restrictions in law that require the #ATF to search through their 800 million gun records ***BY HAND*** when trying to help police solve crimes   https://t.co/nMweVW0TSp

Run the numbers to find out if this improved #MPP is right for your farm and the forecasted net return: https://t.co/K1cgI3XrGbBut it IS happening, &amp; we need to do something about it. We owe it to the victims—and to the thousands of children who have witnessed shootings—to advance commonsense reforms to better protect our schools &amp; our communities. We shouldn’t wait for one more tragedy. #EnoughIsEnoughPoliticians need to stop making excuses for #gunviolence. When you look at gun deaths/mental health/video game use in like-countries, we’re off the charts in just 1 category...almost 22 standard deviations ABOVE the norm. A statistician would tell you this shouldn’t happen. https://t.co/iJJHMw9Lv3Most critically, it should not fall to just the President’s own appointees at DOJ/FBI to protect the once-sacred walls between law enforcement and the White House. #Republicans in Congress need to reject this overreach. It’s time for COUNTRY over PARTY — and over #paranoia.The President’s escalating efforts to undermine the #Russia investigation are dangerous. Jeopardizing the identity of a confidential source would be an abuse of power. This critical national security investigation must continue without baseless political interference. https://t.co/zV6yUtWLXDLeahy REAX On Today’s SCOTUS Decision Concerning The Federal Arbitration Act https://t.co/yccdTyIUuR https://t.co/FKT0Ogq8RlThe President often tweets that the #Russia investigation is a “witch hunt.” Before he vents again on Twitter I hope he asks his #FBI Director about that, as I did this week. No, Mr. President…over 20 indictments and 5 guilty pleas is NOT a #WitchHunt. https://t.co/gCQgNZyF3I***#Important JUNE 1 #Deadline*** nears for #Vermont #dairy farmers, to take advantage of the #MMPP improvements for dairy farmers recently enacted by Congress and now implemented by #USDA. https://t.co/3CNiGktlq2Wow https://t.co/0VDV3lqO16#CambridgeAnalytica may have knowingly violated U.S. law. Despite being warned that foreigners are strictly prohibited from working on U.S. campaigns, its staff was almost entirely non-American, and it deployed them to work on U.S. campaigns. https://t.co/2gUArF6bbuI just voted NO on Ms. #Haspel’s nomination to lead the #CIA. She was deeply involved in our disgraced #torture program &amp; in destroying torture tapes. I agree w @SenJohnMcCain that her refusal to denounce torture as immoral is disqualifying. My statement: https://t.co/60eu8KuUhx#CambridgeAnalytica was Trump before Trump. At the direction of Steve Bannon in 2014, it tested messages like “build the wall” and “drain the swamp” and tested policies of Russian President Putin. These later became the defining themes of candidate Trump. https://t.co/2FpAHgDg9YTo help our communities, we need to remove the stigma of mental illness and addiction. To have the chance to recover, people need to be able to ask for help.

It used misappropriated data of 87 m. people to create psychological profiles in order to spread #DISinformation and suppress Democratic voters. That is NOT politics as usual. https://t.co/NEi6hsyd9lYesterday I questioned the #CambridgeAnalytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie about CA’s exploitation of 87 million #Facebook users’ personal data, and its unethical role in recent U.S. elections. Here’s what I learned:REAX Of Sen. Leahy (chief sponsor of the bipartisan CREATES Act) To FDA’s Naming Of Drug Firms That Are Blocking Lower-Cost Generic Prescription Drugs https://t.co/GQkaauKMmG https://t.co/Ruq3IJcB7yAn excellent #explainer from @NPR. And with @SGottliebFDA today naming names of #drug firms that are blocking the competition that would bring down #prescription costs, a good time to focus on my bipartisan #CREATES Act to prevent this practice.  https://t.co/VcRLdjErfJ https://t.co/PGSgapquB9Proud to be one of those in the "Y" column... https://t.co/EkoTMC1KROThe Senate MOMENTARILY will vote on our resolution to restore #NetNeutrality. I will vote YES to restore a free &amp; open internet and ensure that Vermont’s small businesses aren’t strangled by paid prioritization &amp; throttled internet speeds. Full statement: https://t.co/BgP4bLcPJJ https://t.co/9dD2kwwVDtWhy does Administrator Pruitt insist on flying first class and squandering American taxpayers’ dollars while removing @EPA protections for public health and the environment? “It’s ego run amok.” https://t.co/my2kvzZR05The EPA cannot disregard its job to protect the environment and public health over ‘PR concerns.’ That blocking the study was even considered is a black mark on the agency’s record.It’s unconscionable that the @EPA under Administrator Pruitt would block the release of a public health study on the harmful effects of PFOA, which is hurting #Bennington #Vt and other communities across the nation, because it would be a “public relations nightmare.” https://t.co/0Q1w7mwyZyThere is still so much we do not know. That is exactly why both the #Mueller investigation &amp; the inquiry by the #JudiciaryCommittee — which is in the best position to keep the public informed — need to continue. The American people deserve to know the facts.We have also learned that at least some Trump campaign officials knew that Russia had stolen emails months before it was publicly reported. This places all of the bizarre outreach to Russia, and covering up their contacts, in a very disturbing light.Today the Judiciary Committee released interview transcripts on the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. It is indisputable the #Trump campaign went into the meeting expecting to receive dirt on Clinton from the #Kremlin—that is, they were trying to collude. Then they misled about it.Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Leahy Statement On FY 19 Funding Request Hearing With @EPA Administrator Pruitt https://t.co/cEFcvMrUeZ https://t.co/YFP9PBcLVfHere in the Senate there’s good news. Chairman @SenShelby and I are focused on moving forward on a bipartisan basis on the fiscal year 2019 #Appropriations process. And we’re making progress.Congress passed a bipartisan Approps bill &amp; the Pres. signed it into law. The President’s misguided rescission package to claw funds away from children, seniors &amp; law enforcement should be abandoned in favor of the bipartisan Approps process that @SenShelby &amp; I have already begun https://t.co/XjH8IhrlPhAs a former State’s Attorney, I’ve seen firsthand the dutiful, difficult &amp; dangerous work that law enforcement officers do to keep us safe.
