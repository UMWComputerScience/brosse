And how will the administration reunify children &amp; families? https://t.co/1id1ax5cAZ https://t.co/nWBQC6CxRdTrump's Executive Order doesn‚Äôt end zero tolerance or reunite thousands of children w/ their parents. It DOES force families into indefinite detention as they go thru the asylum process ‚Äì as if the solution to keeping children out of detention is to detain entire families https://t.co/DkuuuZGiPORemember, seeking asylum is not a crime ‚Äì but President Trump has made it so.

Original policy: zero tolerance.

It's time to end zero tolerance, and stop criminalizing asylum seekers.We did it!  We put kids first and blocked Trump Republicans from cutting billions from the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program.

Kudos to @starledger for this.
 https://t.co/3iXJr1YF5SMore jaw-dropping than anything Pres. Trump tweets is his administration‚Äôs relentless effort to take away healthcare and jack up your premiums.

Congrats to the #ClassOf2018 and to Dr. Strout as you both take the next step in your careers. https://t.co/oLjNXGIvzBEnough with the gamesmanship. Dealing with‚Ä¶ https://t.co/3WggSOzgBPGreat to see my U.S. Senate resolution honoring the 197th Greek Independence Day pass yesterday!

The future for the hard-working #ClassOf2018 is bright and filled with potential. You make us all #NJProud. 

My #GraduationAdviceIn5Words: Go do what you love. #RUCamden18We need to do more than FDA‚Äôs ‚Äúnaming and shaming‚Äù of big brand name drug makers that game the system to block cheaper generics so they can make more $$$.  Let‚Äôs pass our CREATES Act to stop the cheaters, increase competition &amp; give consumers some relief! https://t.co/eZbnFuNwyII stand with LGBTQ persons around the world who courageously fight bigotry &amp; hate every day. Governments must protect individual rights and combat, not embrace, prejudice &amp; oppression. The U.S. must always lead on the world stage with our values, including human rights.  #IDAHOTB https://t.co/8wtScmyVMJCompletely heartbroken by this horrible news. Praying for these young students and their families. https://t.co/6sS15Gn3uUCongratulations to all of the #KeanCougars graduating from @KeanUniversity!

@MiddlesexCounCo @MercerCollege @BergenCC @atlanticcape @ccc_nj @HudsonCCC @pccc_eduDo you hear Laurel or Yanny? My staff was shocked that I could hear both.   Calling all scientists, techies, and Jedi to please reply and explain... https://t.co/KWg8Og9W6lMy @PostOpinions on North Korea: Rather than empower the @StateDept and the skilled diplomats best equipped for this major diplomatic initiative, the Trump Admin has eviscerated it. To this day Trump has failed to even nominate an ambassador to South Korea https://t.co/CcprV5CnG8The president‚Äôs impulsive and erratic approach to foreign policy has left our allies confused and our adversaries emboldened. To take advantage of this critical opportunity in North Korea, he needs disciplined leadership and a real strategy. https://t.co/CcprV5TZ4II just voted to restore the #NetNeutrality rules because the internet of the future must be as free and open as it was in the past. I did it for small businesses like @elementstruffle, @HotSpotGot &amp; those I met at @KearnyPoint. I did it for the tens of thousands who wrote to me. https://t.co/NXq6eGa3mrVoting now to restore #NetNeutrality because an open Internet lets the smallest of startups compete with the largest corporations - without having to pay for priority access online.

For example, this small business owner in Montclair wrote to me on why it matters to her https://t.co/Vmc7KxmXKoThis is why I couldn‚Äôt vote for Trump @FTA_DOT nominee Thelma Drake. https://t.co/Vy594hXt5yWhether you're now Dr. Kane, or Jane Smith, MBA, or Master Rodriguez (ok people may not say that last one but you get the point) congrats to the entire @KeanGradCollege #Classof2018! You reached high, you worked hard, and now we‚Äôre all excited to see where your future takes you! https://t.co/wJDEGY8YqoI am so proud of the incredibly driven graduates of Rutgers Med (@NJMSDeansOffice)! Not only have they successfully graduated from medical school, but they managed to defy all odds and pass organic chemistry! Congratulations to the #Classof2018 - you deserve it! #NJMSGrad2018 https://t.co/lElinWSKSnPara garantizar unas condiciones electorales leg√≠timas, @NicolasMaduro debe liberar a todos los presos pol√≠ticos, y permitir que todos los candidatos/partidos pol√≠ticos puedan participar. #SOSVenezuela https://t.co/dSfFhKHmG0An open Internet is the great equalizer that lets the smallest of startups compete with the largest corporations - without having to pay for priority access online.

Listen to this story from a small business owner in Montclair who needs #NetNeutrality https://t.co/t5Zdhf2Bdz@Fieldandfen @SenBooker Very much so - just look at some of what I've said on this here: https://t.co/d0MJZ0DHTq@LastLineOfCance Proud to have written and championed this legislation for years. We are so close!@MomsRising Active engagement with your elected officials through meetings, letter-writing and organizing, as well as educating the public, will put pressure on those legislators that do not understand the harm the Administration‚Äôs policies are causing. #ProtectFamiliesI strongly urge everyone to reach out to advocacy organizations in your area like @MaketheRoadNJ or national groups like @UnitedWeDream @Unidos and @AmericasVoice so you can be part of their efforts to protect and advance immigrant rights. #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/binyqLgS8XDHS &amp; DOJ enforce immigration policies that are set by the President &amp; Congress, but by reaching out to your elected officials and advocating for humane and respectful immigration policies, you can help advance women‚Äôs rights, health and safety amongst immigrants #protectFamilies https://t.co/LJbJpYFco1@MomsRising The Trump Admin has conflated immigration w/ criminality to further his nativist agenda. And even when experts said not to, they terminated TPS, leaving hundreds of thousands who have lived &amp; worked here legally at risk of deportation &amp; losing their families. #ProtectFamiliesA4: The Trump Admin has conflated immigration w/ criminality to further his nativist agenda. And even when experts said not to, they terminated TPS, leaving hundreds of thousands who have lived &amp; worked here legally at risk of deportation &amp; losing their families #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/PE0S2c3QGrA3: The mothers of #DACA recipients are certainly hurt. And 1/4 of DACA recipients are parents of US citizen children. DACA has changed the lives of women &amp; youth, but President Trump ended it anyway, &amp; failed to present a reasonable legislative compromise #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/VvnXtBULaI@MomsRising Here‚Äôs a heart-wrenching example: The Trump Admin's ICE detains pregnant immigrant women, putting undue stress and irreparable harm on pregnant women who are often separated from their families, lacking necessary medical care, and facing immigration proceedings¬†#ProtectFamiliesHere‚Äôs 2 examples: Trump Admin is tearing apart immigrant families so women are less likely to file domestic violence reports for fear of deportation. Plus women fleeing gender-based oppression &amp; violence have legitimate asylum claims, but are being turned away. #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/sPms04zNsSImmigration is esp. important to women when you consider that women are over half of all immigrants in our country &amp; Pres. Trump‚Äôs proposed ‚Äúmerit based‚Äù system would change the family immigration system used by 70% of women ¬†to obtain legal status in the U.S. #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/HEwoZC7xjg@MomsRising Absolutely! Over 5 million undocumented women currently reside in the U.S, with those in immigration detention facing abuse, harassment and inadequate prenatal and gynecological care. 

If that's not a women's issue, I don't know what is. #ProtectFamiliesCongrats @Rutgers_Newark #Classof2018 on your hard-earned graduation yesterday.

Proud of all of you, and a bit jealous you got to hear from NJ‚Äôs own @IAMQUEENLATIFAH. She was spot on when she described #ScarletRaiders as ‚ÄúAmerica at its finest." #NJProud #NJStrong #RUNgraduation https://t.co/DCTowybhQnI can't help but ‚Äúsmile‚Äù when I congratulate @RUDental #Classof2018. Thanks to your diligent hard work, I have a ‚Äúfilling‚Äù you'll all do great things! So ‚Äúbrace‚Äù yourselves for the amazing future you have ahead of you, &amp; I promise it won't include any more of my bad dentist puns. https://t.co/9dznIhJRIeCongrats to @RutgersU #Classof2018 on taking the next step in your career.

I'm consistently blown away by your intelligence and perseverance, and can't wait to see what the future holds. #RU2018 https://t.co/mVpW6w8ePpCongrats to today‚Äôs @NJIT grads - the inventors, entrepreneurs, and job creators of tomorrow. 

Your hard work has paid off, and who knows, maybe I‚Äôll be posting congratulations to the Class of 2020 on a new social media platform one of you will create.

Tambi√©n presentaremos un nuevo proyecto de ley integral pronto https://t.co/RFMI2SdbmTThe small businesses at @KearnyPoint in New Jersey prove that anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can be an entrepreneur, an innovator, and a job-creator.
 
And all of them need equal access to high speed internet. They need #NetNeutrality https://t.co/gGdKWo9JSnDrivers get stuck in traffic. Buses get overcrowded and have to refuse passengers. Clearly, commuters need more options, and getting to Manhattan on a ferry in less than an hour certainly fits that bill. https://t.co/UIJvVjvsILThank you to all the law enforcement officers in New Jersey and throughout the country who put their lives on the line every day. 

This #NationalPoliceWeek we honor your service, and thank you for your sacrifice and commitment to our communities. https://t.co/ji9skvfm3OIf there‚Äôs any place in New Jersey that embodies the entrepreneurial spirit unleashed by a #FreeAndOpenInternet ‚Äì it‚Äôs right here at @KearnyPoint. 

These businesses need equal access to high speed internet.

Why does #NetNeutrality matter at a small chocolate factory? 
Simple. Fast access to apps, market research &amp; email for customer service https://t.co/YDWAwMpL6nWith a #FreeAndOpenInternet, these @RutgersU grads founded HotSpot Got and from their office in @KearnyPoint are on a path to creating high-paying jobs. 

We need #NetNeutrality for them. We need it so large, small &amp; startup businesses have equal access to fast internet https://t.co/vndT3z3ZPM6 years ago NJans spoke out clearly in favor of legal sports betting. W/ SCOTUS decision, pro sports leagues can no longer protect their own money-making interests at our expense. NJ can bring sports gaming into the light, create new economic opportunities &amp; help the entire state https://t.co/N7q4khw11P@sgitomer Working hard at it!Cutting ZTE a break at the expense of American jobs and security is a bad deal for our working families and undermines sanctions as a credible tool of US foreign policy. 

President Trump shouldn‚Äôt tweet away our leverage and American jobs. https://t.co/2d5JxtrXlFMy mother was strong. My mother was loving, wise &amp; dedicated. And I see her tremendous joy and spirit in my daughter, @AliciaMenendez, every day as she raises little Evangelina. Happy #MothersDay to her and all the #moms out there who know the meaning of limitless love. https://t.co/gCs6B5ROG6President Trump's actions speak louder than words.   I want him to tackle the high cost  of prescription drugs, but forgive me for being skeptical when he spent the last year trying to gut healthcare protections, rip insurance from millions, and cut taxes for wealthy corporationsWe will not back down in the fight to build Gateway.  We will not allow anyone to stand in the way of this critical project ‚Äì including this Administration.  It is simply too important for our economy and our future. https://t.co/7OjZ2lplM8I cannot support Gina Haspel's nomination to lead the CIA. America must stand up for values like human rights and the rule of law. As my friend @SenJohnMcCain has said, our values define our moral leadership around the world as we condemn repressive regimes' use of torture. https://t.co/TBPuyygassWe need bigger legislative solutions to high prescription drug costs. 

I want to work with @SenateDems &amp; any willing party on a serious, comprehensive plan because we can all agree that the cost of prescription drugs is just too damn high. #FlashbackFriday #fbf https://t.co/PekWnxWyQFHow will helping prescription drug companies increase prices overseas do anything to lower #drugpricing here at home?
 
We've seen exactly what happens to #drugprices when major prescription drug companies get a windfall of cash: https://t.co/3RXmd5oDP8Pres. Trump's prescription drug plan needs to include this bill to bring generic drugs to the market.
 
Big corporations keep their high-priced drugs as the sole option by finding loopholes to withhold samples generic manufacterers need. 
 
I want to change that. https://t.co/3Nuxyvg1ORI was ticked when I found out pharmacists are BANNED from telling you how to save money on your prescription drugs. 

Here‚Äôs a simple bill we could pass to fix that.  Will it be in President Trump‚Äôs plan?? https://t.co/RxbanIvUxwAs President Trump unveils a plan on prescription drugs, will it include the SPIKE Act? It's a simple bill I support to require drug companies explain unreasonable price hikes, and make public what they spend on drug development vs marketing.

No reason it shouldn't be considered https://t.co/HF0pXek0nkThe internet has changed lives, fostered innovation and created countless jobs, and all under #NetNeutrality rules. @SenateDems and I are so close to stopping the Trump Administration from gutting these protections. https://t.co/ApgPc5VMTSFirefighters not only encounter smoke &amp; flames when they run into burning buildings, but also dangerous fumes, toxins, and known carcinogens. We must prevent cancer in firefighters by developing better ways of protecting them through study and understanding of their cancer risks.#BREAKING: The US Senate has stood up for the health &amp; well-being of our first responders and passed my important legislation!

This is a huge win for our firefighters, who risk so much every time they answer the call to protect us. Read about it here: https://t.co/Sr2hv9BGrg https://t.co/kzkG48ZqZ1. @SenJohnMcCain is an American hero who dedicated his entire life to serving our country. 
 
Fake news is dangerous. https://t.co/2EiVQSJiC0Meeting with business leaders (and local job creators) to strategize how we ensure the Gateway transit project continues. 

A hostile administration isn't going to stop us - we will get this #infrastructure project built! https://t.co/QSJICMQ05O#ListenToTheExperts  --&gt;   ‚Äú...we have to ask: Why does the administration think this makes sense as an 'America First' policy? Why would they take people who legally work, pay taxes, own homes, run businesses, employ others and obey the law, and shove them into the shadows?‚Äù https://t.co/4TpHOs83yzAfter years of progress, the Trump Administration took over and has managed to drive the number of uninsured Americans UP for the first time since 2013.
 
More uninsured = higher costs for us all https://t.co/u6tMaqpl2TToday is an affirmation that we must do everything possible to use strong diplomacy to secure the release of these citizens. We owe them nothing less.Unfortunately, too many American families continue to suffer the anguish of family members being unjustly held hostage by repressive regimes across the world, including New Jersey's  Xiyue Wang.This is nevertheless a very positive sign for the possibility of a diplomatic pathway to denuclearization, peace and stability on the peninsula.  Working w/ our allies, I sincerely hope the Trump admin robustly pursues this diplomatic path w/ the required discipline &amp; strategy.But let‚Äôs be clear, these three Americans, two taken hostage in the last 15 months, never should have been arbitrarily imprisoned by North Korea.This is great news and I join the families in this moment of profound relief. I commend Secretary Pompeo, and look forward to discussing his trips to Pyongyang upon his return.  https://t.co/JLJGBDflOJWith just these 4 actions alone, the Trump Administration is raising your health care costs. 

They couldn't pass #Trumpcare into law, but you deserve to know that they are masterfully stripping away ACA protections anyway. https://t.co/b9II8G9R4CReprehensible for Republicans to try to lessen the blow of their $2 trillion, deficit-busting, corporate tax cut on the backs of Sandy victims. https://t.co/tFzWW8YTVDThe internet has changed lives, fostered innovation and created countless jobs...

 ...and all under #NetNeutrality rules. 

@SenateDems and I are so close to stopping the Trump Administration from gutting these protections. https://t.co/Gwm7km8FJQCaught up w/ Max Schill in South Jersey on Friday. 2 years ago we worked together to pass the 21st Century CURES Act funding research into rare diseases like Noonan Syndrome, which he suffers from.

I told him my dedication to finding cures is as strong as his handshake. https://t.co/0O3N4du8vOIt would be woefully irresponsible for Congress to turn a blind-eye to these discoveries. 

The decision-making process for TPS designations should never be hijacked for political purposes.  https://t.co/A0OvR8GTKHWhy am I filing a petition to hold a vote to restore #NetNeutrality today?   For America's entrepreneurs.   Small businesses need high-speed internet to compete and thrive, and that means they need a free and open internet to drive innovation that benefits all of us. https://t.co/Hr8ugM6w4fA free and open internet is good for innovation, for democracy, and for consumers. 

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working w/ @SenateDems to force a vote to restore #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/lIvsw8xka0This is exactly why we need better gun laws on the NATIONAL level. 
 
https://t.co/nuIO216ixJI will fight against this cavalier-recklessness that would jeopardize our national security simply to fulfill a campaign promise and pursue an agenda of mass deportation that tears families apart, and separates mothers and fathers from their U.S. children. https://t.co/QH5zXJJc98#BREAKING: An investigation by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee uncovered body of evidence detailing how the Trump Admin deliberately ignored the counsel of senior @StateDept officials &amp; embassies to deport immigrant families en masse. 

READ here:  https://t.co/nq5yJxGO8yI told NJans in my office today from the @MachinistsUnion that my dedication to their cause hasn't dwindled in the face of hard times. 
In fact, I'm more dedicated than ever to working families and their right to organize for higher wages and better benefits. #UnionStrong https://t.co/mOZ56GN5yc@secupp Yes that was and remains my view, but sanctions don't work if we're alone. I'm devoted to bipartisan support for biting, multilateral sanctions &amp; investing in partnerships to push back on Iranian aggression. 
Trump‚Äôs decision today means we will have neither.@NJEA I did! Ms. Harper had a fundamental impact on my life ---&gt; https://t.co/XqgGljPJ0YMs. Harper gave me a voice &amp; helped me discover that I was pretty good at using that voice to advocate for others.

So for #TeacherAppreciationWeek, make sure you #ThankATeacherMs. Gail Harper at Union Hill High School saw my potential before anyone else. She kept me after class to recite poetry and speeches, assigning me a speaking role the narrator for a school play. 
#TeacherAppreciationWeek #ThankATeacherI know it's hard to imagine a U.S. Senator being unable to get up and give a speech, but when I was in school, public speaking was a nightmare for me. 
 
Ms. Harper changed that. #TeacherAppreciationDay(2) how the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime will be rebuilt without a coalition of the willing; 
and (3) how the Administration plans to address the range of ways in which Iran continues to threaten the security of the United States and our allies.The President must immediately send his national security team to Congress to explain (1) how his Administration will continue long-standing U.S. policy to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon outside of the JCPOA without partners...And let's not forget, Congress is still waiting for the Administration to deliver the legally-mandated strategy for countering Iran that was due in January.The governments of Iran, Russia, and China will seize this opportunity of self-imposed U.S. isolation to continue major weapons sales, deepen economic ties, and further challenge the United States and Europe not only in the Middle East but in other areas like North Korea.
