Appreciate the opportunity to raise this concern w/ President Erdogan &amp; will keep working to better US-Turkey relations &amp; secure the freedom of Brunson and all detained Americans and embassy employees.Pastor Andrew Brunson has been unjustly imprisoned &amp; kept away from family for over 1 year. Today I met w/ him and his wife &amp; yesterday appealed directly to President Erdogan for his release.I‚Äôm in Turkey to help build a constructive dialogue with President Erdogan on the cases of Americans wrongfully arrested and other issues of mutual concern. President Erdogan was receptive to my and @LindseyGrahamSC‚Äôs concerns.NH families should never have to worry about the safety of their drinking water. I‚Äôll keep fighting for more research on PFAS contamination &amp; will keep pushing @EPA to act and heed our community‚Äôs recommendations to get our residents the answers they need.
https://t.co/JHT8gsAe3rPleased to see the Senate Farm bill that passed w/ bipartisan support maintains crucial funding for SNAP, keeping more than 90,000 Granite Staters from going hungry. I fought efforts to restrict access to these benefits &amp; will continue to oppose actions that threaten NH families.Proud to see Granite Staters at ArgenTech Solutions honored with the 2018 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. Well deserved recognition of your support of employees in the National Guard &amp; Reserve, &amp; your contributions to our national defense.Incredibly, the Capital Gazette is still planning on publishing a paper tomorrow which is a profound demonstration of dedication to journalism &amp; the local community. I can‚Äôt imagine how hard this must be after being terrorized by a mass shooter.My heart goes out to the Capital Gazette &amp; the families of the victims. Gun violence cannot become normalized &amp; we must continue to call for commonsense legislation.Very pleased to see Chief Willard approved by the Judiciary Committee with unanimous bipartisan support to serve as U.S. Marshal for NH. Looking forward to his confirmation in the full Senate so he can begin work on issues critical to NH‚Äôs safety &amp; security.The callousness of the separation policy is just unconscionable. Every last child must be reunited with their parents w/o delay. Nothing less is acceptable.The Trump admin must answer for why they separated children from their parents with no plan in place to reunite them. Are we to conclude that there was no intention to reunite these families?This is a moral outrage. Thousands of children are still separated from their parents.  The Trump Admin must immediately reunite all of these families. https://t.co/N6FwGNMGFOThank you, Lt. Nicole Ledoux of the Manchester PD &amp; Lara Quiroga from the Manchester Community Health Center for speaking with @SenateDems this morning about NH‚Äôs ongoing efforts to combat the opioid crisis.

Today‚Äôs #SCOTUS #Janus ruling hurts workers in NH &amp; across the country.Allowing these centers to misrepresent women‚Äôs #reprohealth options is dangerous &amp; prevents women from making informed decisions about their health care. https://t.co/YrXDzJ9dSbVery concerned by #SCOTUS ruling to allow facilities to disguise themselves as health centers so they can impose an anti-choice agenda &amp; withhold critical health information from women about their #reprohealth options.Celebrating #PrideMonth by remembering the momentous celebration when marriage equality became the law of the land. There is still so much to do, however, &amp; I will keep pushing Congress to pass the Equality Act to protect our LGBTQ community. #EqualityForward üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàThere are no winners in trade wars, Mr. President.

He will be greatly missed, and his words will live on forever. https://t.co/nVcd74fxYNThis morning I had the honor of presenting Captain Martin Gelb with the Congressional Gold Medal for his service to our country during WWII.

NH small businesses do not have the time or resources to become tax collectors for other states. https://t.co/aKD61iUNFcThis is just unconscionable. At any time, President Trump can reverse HIS policy and he must do so now!President Trump‚Äôs executive order provides no resolution to the family separation crisis. Children will still be held in detention facilities.

I‚Äôm fighting for the #KeepFamiliesTogether bill to block this decision by the Trump administration &amp; urging R Senators to join. This is not who we are.DHS just told Congress the stats on #FamilySeparation: 2,342 children were removed from their parents in just over a month. That‚Äôs about 70 children a day.

We need an honest, clear-eyed assessment of the conflict and recommendations for a path forward.There‚Äôs currently one hold on my Syria Study Group legislation (HR 390), preventing it from moving forward in the Senate. Recent events and the lack of an admin strategy further stress the need for a top to bottom review of our policy in Syria.Congrats to the Granite Staters and all the runners in today‚Äôs #BostonMarathon!

We remember those days, and we refuse to be taken back.I remember the days prior to 1973 when abortion was against the law in most states. An est. 1.2 MILLION women each year resorted to illegal abortions, typically performed in unsanitary conditions by unlicensed practitioners, often resulting in infection, hemorrhage, even death.FROM MY REMARKS JUST DELIVERED ON SENATE FLOOR: We know from harsh experience that outlawing abortion does not end abortion, it simply drives it into the shadows and unsafe conditions.This is a pervasive cultural problem at the US Olympic Committee &amp; many governing bodies ‚Äì Congress needs to act to deliver answers &amp; accountability. https://t.co/wjIdaHAXP9Congress &amp; President Trump need to listen to students in NH &amp; across the nation demanding action on commonsense reform to end gun violence.

Call 211 for shelter &amp; warming center info. #ReadyNHWe need a new Education Secretary. https://t.co/spu97Rl2RqCheering on #TeamUSA and all of our athletes competing in the Paralympics. Granite Staters were especially proud to see alpine skier @tbone_walker of Franconia compete last weekend, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing him hit the slopes later this week! https://t.co/RZALya9Nh7It‚Äôs our hope that both the Sanders-Lee-Murphy resolution &amp; our proposal be debated &amp; voted on. U.S. policy in Yemen must be subject to congressional oversight and that is what our bipartisan legislation will provideOur legislation makes clear that U.S. support for our allies fighting in Yemen must be contingent on efforts to end the conflict diplomatically &amp; improve the humanitarian situationTHREAD: The humanitarian devastation caused by the conflict in Yemen is heartbreaking &amp; Congress needs to take action. I have partnered w/ @SenToddYoung to find an effective means to save innocent livesEnding #netneutrality protections would rig the internet against rural communities and small businesses in New Hampshire. Today I heard from business owners and entrepreneurs at @AlphaSync in Portsmouth on the impact this would have on our state. https://t.co/bwwKi1Co41Glad to see some form of accountability in response to these heinous allegations, but it‚Äôs unconscionable that it took 2 decades. Why did it take so long? This is why we need a special committee to investigate USOC. https://t.co/TwPenlroY7Too many American communities have been devastated by oil spills, and we can‚Äôt afford one near New Hampshire‚Äôs coast. The deadline to tell the Trump administration how you feel about its offshore drilling proposal is TONIGHT (11:59 PM ET). Submit here: https://t.co/cPF96S7YBINew Hampshire is supported by $4 billion in exports. I remain concerned about the significant impact that a tariff on steel and aluminum will have on our economy. My full statement on President Trump‚Äôs announcement: https://t.co/1ApSiMA6fxWith @amprog on #InternationalWomensDay to discuss my efforts to repeal the Global Gag Rule. The GGR denies assistance to the most effective health orgs that work in developing world &amp; help millions of women &amp; girls. I'll keep fighting to reverse this dangerous policy. https://t.co/Igabqekk6X.@SenatorCollins and I introduced a resolution today designating March 8, 2018 #InternationalWomensDay to recognize women‚Äôs achievements around the globe &amp; stress the urgent need to keep pushing forward. Our work goes on.It is incumbent upon all of us to continue to fight for equality so that the next generation doesn‚Äôt have to fight the same fights that we do. #InternationalWomensDay is both a reminder of how far we‚Äôve come, but also of how far we have to go.These barriers are in large part because women are still not equally represented in governments at home and abroad. That must change. #InternationalWomensDayWomen &amp; girls account for +50% of the world population, yet numerous barriers prevent them from being fully equal and having access to education and necessary healthcare. #InternationalWomensDayTHREAD: On #InternationalWomensDay we celebrate the achievements of women and girls around the world, but also recognize the real obstacles that still stand in our way for equal rights and opportunities.Glad to be joining @amprog on #InternationalWomensDay for a discussion on the need to repeal the Trump admin‚Äôs expanded Global Gag Rule, which puts family planning &amp; women‚Äôs health at risk around the globe. Tune in at 12PM: https://t.co/fbSHCsEodTLove it! üí™ https://t.co/FPk1pMhMC3Granite Staters have an opportunity to weigh in on the Trump administration‚Äôs offshore drilling proposal. The deadline is this Friday ‚Äì submit here: https://t.co/cPF96S7YBIThe rate of overdoses from opioids continues to surge with a 30% increase across the country last year. States, including NH, are still not getting the support they need from the federal government to respond to this growing epidemic. https://t.co/uraB2AtV3AElephants ARE NOT trophies! Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to sport hunting these beautiful &amp; endangered animals. Follow through on your promise to reverse this policy: https://t.co/Q8RIzERUYGHB1264 is aimed squarely at young voters in NH to discourage participation. That‚Äôs disgraceful. Republican lawmakers should appeal to the concerns and interests of young voters, not block their access to the ballot box. My full statement: https://t.co/JnUyMaMn6mMy full letter to @SecElaineChao here: https://t.co/YTT4J8KEAuJust spoke with @SecElainChao: Thrilled to share that $10 million in federal funding is coming to NH for the I-89 Lebanon-Hartford Bridge Project. I‚Äôve been urging DOT to invest in this critical local infrastructure project.I am urging President Trump to reconsider his plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. A trade war would be a disaster for New Hampshire. More in my full letter to the President: https://t.co/yASOrIVmOA.@SenJoniErnst &amp; I join @MegynKelly shortly on @MegynTODAY to discuss our bipartisan resolution to establish a special committee to investigate the USOC &amp; USA Gymnastics to get Nassar survivors the answers they deserve. Tune in at 9:10AM. https://t.co/uDLqfgGs5OSadly, even children are affected by the opioid crisis. This new study shows the # of kids sent to pediatric intensive care units doubled between 2004 and 2015. We need broad participation in drug take-back programs &amp; prevention education. https://t.co/ENg0XPLif2Today I led a letter to the President urging him to hold two recently captured ISIS fighters accountable for the murders of American citizens, including NH resident James Foley. My full letter w/ @SenatorHassan &amp; @SenBillNelson on behalf of the victims‚Äô families here: https://t.co/BdFjrLliHXThe Trump admin‚Äôs offshore drilling proposal is a direct threat to our regional economy &amp; small businesses, &amp; could do real harm to the environment. Today in Concord, starting at 3pm, there‚Äôs an opportunity for Granite Staters to make their voices heard. https://t.co/m8bQr9s4H9Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act has helped nearly 11,000 Granite Staters access treatment for substance use disorders. I encourage you all to take some time and read Brian‚Äôs letter in the @NashuaTelegraph. https://t.co/96M2sSLUTpIt‚Äôs completely backward that middle-class families are funding a tax cut for big pharmaceutical companies. We must pass the End Taxpayers Subsidies for Drug Ads Act. https://t.co/nXh90SSdw9President Trump‚Äôs plan to impose steep steel and aluminum tariffs could negatively impact every sector of New Hampshire‚Äôs economy. My statement: https://t.co/3LJZdHWiIvProud to see the future USS Manchester delivered to the Navy. I look forward to the ship‚Äôs commissioning in Portsmouth! https://t.co/uSPaV61Kq2The US Olympic Committee did nothing to prevent Larry Nassar from abusing U.S. gymnasts. I applaud @Aly_Raisman for pursuing accountability. Congress must be an ally in this fight and rigorously investigate and help change the culture at USOC https://t.co/PDkL9AaVAxI was pleased to receive assurances from Trump admin nominee Kevin Moley to support Foley family plea and bring the killers of their son to justice. https://t.co/Nh3G37nGpoSupporting the integrity of the State Department is a strong, bipartisan effort. Agree w/ @LindseyGrahamSC: our diplomats are absolutely critical to addressing our global challenges. We should support our career diplomatic corps, not hollow it out. https://t.co/3irFsW0PVvGlad to join @margbrennan for a discussion on women‚Äôs contributions to peace &amp; security at the @CFR_org this morning. https://t.co/DLq1i41hErU.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun‚Äôs resignation is long overdue. My statement: https://t.co/x3pviSnLfHWhen we lift up women, we lift up families, and we lift up everybody. It was great to join @SenatorHassan on @WMUR9 to discuss the progress we‚Äôve made in New Hampshire. https://t.co/w4uyuUjaFSJoining w/ @SenThomTillis to launch the Senate NATO Observer Group. The NATO Observer Group will serve as a focal point for engagement between NATO &amp; the Senate as these institutions strengthen transatlantic bonds &amp; modernize NATO to respond to hybrid warfare &amp; other threats. https://t.co/GjBe1u4B6PWe owe it to the next generation to protect our air, water and land &amp; fight climate change. That‚Äôs always been a top priority for me &amp; I‚Äôm proud to have a perfect score on the 2017 @LCVoters scorecard. Take a look: https://t.co/W9OIqn7IygHappy birthday to my friend and fellow Granite Stater in the Senate, @SenatorHassan! https://t.co/azMIABYn3I#NetNeutrality is the key to a free &amp; open internet. We can‚Äôt allow the Trump admin to rig the internet against NH rural communities &amp; small biz. I‚Äôll keep fighting for a level playing field for all small biz &amp; work to safeguard #netneutrality protections. https://t.co/zZwowjyW71Glad to see the @DeptofDefense &amp; @StateDept take action to combat Russian interference in US elections. I fought to free these funds to support this initiative &amp; protect our democracy. This is an important step, but more work remains to protect the 2018 elections. https://t.co/7Q5SwgTNjvThis further underscores the need for a special committee to investigate the USOC. Victims want answers from the institution that failed to protect them. USOC operates under a federal charter‚Äî the Senate has a responsibility to act. https://t.co/88mFfS5zqXThis partnership between the Dept of Defense, VA, DEKA &amp; @NextStepBandP is a great example of the public &amp; private sectors working together on a solution for the greater good. Congrats to Dean Kamen and all who contributed for your ingenious workThe Luke arm promises new freedom for those who have lost an arm. This is particularly promising for the men &amp; women of our military who have paid a tremendous sacrifice for their country. https://t.co/R9QhuKLmDA#NetNeutrality repeal is now going into effect. This is a real threat to business innovation in NH and the consumer experience online. I‚Äôm backing bipartisan legislation to reverse this Trump administration decision &amp; protect a free and open internet. 

https://t.co/JmFMnuFGzbWhat a game! A huge congrats to @UofNH grad @kbells22 &amp; @NHSHuskies grad @cayla_barnes27 on their historic victory over Canada last night to win Olympic gold. You‚Äôve thrilled NH and the nation. We‚Äôre all so proud!Moms in Recovery program is saving lives every day. Thrilled that fed resources provided through 21st Century Cures Act are helping expand this program across NH. This is why I fought for funding to be included in CURES. Fed dollars being put to good use: https://t.co/sBQxQVZtVtBig congrats to Andy Soucy on his announced retirement. Andy has used music to inspired &amp; enrich students for 46 years at @Londonderry_lhs. Andy has built one of the nation's best music programs. Thank you for your dedication &amp; belief in your students https://t.co/tczICaCfbGDiscussing Russian interference in our democracy at @ISTS_Dartmouth. Our challenge is to fully understand Russia‚Äôs attack on our democracy, expose Putin‚Äôs methods, tactics, and strategy, &amp; do what's necessary to ensure it doesn‚Äôt happen again #nhpolitics https://t.co/ekCUG7YfPoAgree w/ Trump admin‚Äôs @Surgeon_General on need for multi-pronged approach to the opioid crisis including housing support. Hope @RealDonaldTrump is listening. Despite studies, commissions &amp; recommendations, Trump admin has yet to take significant action
https://t.co/mVN4NkToutSpending $30 Million on an unnecessary military parade is just obscene. This funding would be much better spent helping treatment providers &amp; first responders who are often overwhelmed as they battle the opioid epidemic. President Trump promised help--time to deliver #nhpolitics.@realDonaldTrump has just acknowledged Russia‚Äôs attacks on the US. There are no excuses for not imposing sanctions that Congress passed almost unanimously. Indictment paints disturbing picture of Kremlin methods. It‚Äôs time to demonstrate to Putin that we won‚Äôt stand for this.
