#FlattopFriday(s) are always better with friends. Stopped by the Belmont Senior Center for a quick lunch break in Butte today. https://t.co/JTjOO6WnrqThe deed for the Southwest Montana Veterans Home was signed in Butte today alongside an amazing group of folks who never stopped fighting to make this dream a reality. Together, we’ll keep this project on track &amp; deliver a home that’s worthy of our veterans’ service. #mtpol https://t.co/RCxrM44LGIMontanans oppose a sales tax and our businesses shouldn’t be forced to collect taxes to shore up the finances of other states.

https://t.co/WX2W9xv9a5Tonight, the Senate passed a 2018 #FarmBill.

That is why it is critically important that we pass a good #FarmBill that works for Montana producers and rural communities across the country. #mtpolI support the Senate #FarmBill because it protects crop insurance, strengthens the safety net, encourages conservation &amp; feeds our families. It also reauthorizes funding for ag research &amp; @USDA Rural Development grants, giving us some of the best returns on our investment. #mtpolI know what farmers &amp; ranchers want to see in a #FarmBill—not just because I'm one of them, but I because I've visited with them, looked them in the eye &amp; talked. I am here to tell them their voices have been heard &amp; their priorities are reflected in the Senate Farm Bill. #mtpolAs the Senate’s only working farmer, I have seen the benefits of a responsible #FarmBill in rural America. I have also seen the devastating consequences of bad Farm Bills that drove families off their land, dried up small towns and hurt our rural way of life. #mtpolWATCH LIVE as I take to the @SenateFloor on behalf of our nation’s farmers &amp; ranchers to pass a good #FarmBill. #mt… https://t.co/AMJjOBBwwJAs the Senate kicks off debate on the 2018 #FarmBill, I’m rolling up my sleeves to defend Montana's #1 industry.

Check out who won and how you can get in the game by calling your Senators and demanding they support our bill. We just need #OneMoreVote to #SaveTheInternet and preserve #NetNeutrality. #mtpol https://t.co/Yh838mqVOd.@IHSgov has had no permanent director for 3+ years, hindering its ability to deliver on our nation's trust &amp; treaty responsibilities. @POTUS must nominate a permanent director ASAP—we’ve all seen an acting director at the helm &amp; it’s not pretty. #mtpol https://t.co/L0cajAM1wk https://t.co/S2fTbXLQLaThis project increases public access to public lands, allows for responsible timber harvest, protects wildlife, helps the local economy, and provides clean water to folks across northwest MT. It’s a win-win-win-win-win for Montanans. #KeepItPublic #mtpol
https://t.co/SqxAEv47m0“At a time of political polarization, it was encouraging to learn that the Senate Banking Committee recently accomplished something rare: passing a bill developed by Republicans and Democrats on a bipartisan basis.” #mtpol
https://t.co/3udYywRQNxIt’s been a hell of a winter here in Montana, with record breaking snowfall and weeks of sub-zero windchills. Hoping all this precipitation bodes well for the harvest this year! https://t.co/Ux80Dso2L3Stopped by the 41st Annual #MATEShow earlier this week, where I joined Billings Mayor Bill Cole and 14,000 other farmers, ranchers and agriculture pros to share best practices and check out shiny new tools of the trade. #FlattopFriday https://t.co/9xagZRCZdaAs part of my #VeteransVoices series, I'm highlighting @umontana's VETS Office, which serves as a resource center, study space &amp; source of peer support for veterans on campus. Proud to have recently gotten a bill to bolster this &amp; other vets ed benefits signed into law. #mtpol https://t.co/neIXcHZZicAs part of my #VeteransVoices video series, today I’m putting the spotlight on the Missoula Veterans Treatment Court, which helps keep veterans with substance abuse and mental health issues, like PTSD, out of the criminal justice system. #mtpol https://t.co/fGr3Wy8a5vIssues like:
✔️ Government Accountability 
✔️ Protecting Public Lands
✔️ Strengthening National Security
✔️ Defending Medicare &amp; Social Security
✔️ Investing in Infrastructure
✔️ Expanding Rural Broadband
✔️ Caring for Veterans

https://t.co/61T02dLtTdAs part of my #VeteransVoices video series, I’m putting the spotlight on Missoula’s @POVERELLOcentr, which helps get homeless vets off the street. I’ve had the pleasure of working with these folks and hearing their stories firsthand. I want to make sure you hear them too. #mtpol https://t.co/MVYJ5Uo0l5If interim clearances are being used by the White House as a way around final adjudication, it represents a significant corruption of the security clearance process and poses a serious national security risk. #mtpol

Last week she opened her new shop to the public and sold out of everything within hours. Now that’s a Big Sky success story! https://t.co/0wOMlfbja1I’m demanding answers from the @CFPB regarding its investigation into last year's @Equifax data breach, which has stalled under Acting Director @MickMulvaneyOMB. This breach included the personal information of 145.5 million Americans—someone needs to be held accountable. #mtpol https://t.co/GupTh2MHcaEveryone deserves a say in our government and it's my job to make sure Montanans' voices are heard. So, whether it’s in person, over the phone, or online, I want to hear from you. #mtpol https://t.co/ppIf1cUVvtStopped by the #BobcatBirthdayBash on Saturday to celebrate @montanastate’s 125th Anniversary. @umontana also celebrated its 125th birthday this past week. Here's to many more years of educational excellence! ​(and #CatGriz football) https://t.co/FhpqhSxZAGI’ve been traveling across the state to hear from local leaders about their communities’ most pressing infrastructure needs. Yesterday I stopped in Bozeman, where I heard about the importance of expanding broadband and sewer systems in some of MT's fastest-growing areas. #mtpol https://t.co/WBGwQzXnzVOver the last few weeks I’ve been holding roundtables across the state to get feedback on a potential infrastructure bill. I’m still reviewing the President’s proposal, but it’s my job to make sure rural states like Montana get our fair share. #mtpol​
https://t.co/B6rcP9RkggWe need an infrastructure plan that works for Montana. I'm in Bozeman to hear about the infrastructure needs of Montana communities. https://t.co/jwW3EyL0L9It’s always an honor to meet with the Crow Tribal leaders and hear from them about what Congress can do to better uphold our nation’s trust responsibility. #mtpol https://t.co/Um5e9PlECyWatch LIVE:

Kyle Norman, of Great Falls, has been competing in @SO_Montana for six years. He has shown talent and determination that every Montanan can be proud of. #olyMpicTeam #USA https://t.co/11qsFZKE2AHad a great time fielding questions from thousands of Montanans tonight. I make it a priority to meet with folks face-to-face, but when I’m back in the Senate it’s great that I can still get input straight from Montanans via teletownhalls. https://t.co/bd7wgU8kLhIt's unacceptable that some Montanans still can't rely on a landline to complete their calls. This bill will improve service for families and small businesses across rural Montana. I'm proud that it's heading to @potus' desk to become law. #mtpol
https://t.co/aaDY3j5bHYI led the charge to pass legislation naming it National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week. Montana's Tribal Colleges are empowering students and producing the next generation of Native American leaders. #mtpol https://t.co/vykB4HIemmhttps://t.co/FmikHQTre0One of the coolest parts of my job is nominating Montana’s best and brightest to our nation’s prestigious service academies. I happened to be nearby when I found out Bozeman's Lindsay Sage was accepted to @NavalAcademy so I decided to congratulate her in person! #mtpol https://t.co/diUL5MsfvaAs a wheat farmer myself, I was honored to accept @wheatworld’s Congressional Award from the Montana Grain Growers.

Thanks to a lot of support from folks on the ground we not only reauthorized funding, but increased it! #mtpol https://t.co/cc1bm9goJvI bucked both parties to demand a better budget for Montana, and they listened. This budget is the product of compromise and makes critical investments in rural health care clinics, strengthens our military, and delivers for our veterans.#mtpol
https://t.co/2UIAKUiF1xChatted with @cnn's @ChrisCuomo this morning about the bipartisan budget deal we're voting on today. Very glad we FINALLY have a long-term plan to fund the government, reauthorize community health center funding, rebuild our infrastructure &amp; invest in the VA. #mtpol https://t.co/QfD258M6Q2Funding for community health centers has been one of my top priorities. So, I'm incredibly proud to have worked on a bipartisan budget deal that will increase funding for community health centers across the Montana. #mtpol

#mtpol https://t.co/a3YLJGEjdMCommunity health centers across Montana—from Billings to Fairview to Kalispell to Dillon—are making their voices heard! Enough is enough. We must reauthorize funding for CHCs. More than 100,000 Montanans depend on it. #RedAlert4CHCs #mtpol https://t.co/6nZxzf9woaIt’s been 130 days since funding expired for community health centers. Many are already scaling back services and if Congress doesn’t act now some might have to shut down completely. This is a #RedAlert4CHCs – we needed to reauthorize this funding yesterday. #mtpol https://t.co/GON3morYikOn the steps of the @uscapitol with RiverStone Health’s John Felton, of Billings, demanding Congress reauthorize funding for community health centers NOW. https://t.co/dze76EKYJ0The VA isn't living up to its responsibility to address the growing backlog of veterans waiting for doctor appointments. That's why I’ve introduced legislation to reform the system and hold the VA accountable to the veterans it serves. #mtpol  https://t.co/xkf4xqkBuw https://t.co/O0Z76ueIjEI hosted a roundtable in Great Falls to hear from local leaders about what they’d like to see in an infrastructure bill. Folks on the ground know where investments in our roads &amp; bridges are needed most, so let me know what you think at -&gt; infrastructure@tester.senate.gov #mtpol https://t.co/gaUQaZ23aAIn Montana, community health centers are at risk b/c for 130 days Congress has failed to renew their long-term funding. If Congress continues to kick the can down the road, rural communities will see their primary source of health care disappear. #mtpol https://t.co/mmbtAc5xlJ https://t.co/v0gERHfRuYThis letter—signed by 15 local loggers, business owners &amp; conservationists—is exactly what the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act is all about, a #MadeinMT plan "for solving long-term challenges on public lands in our communities' backyard." #mtpol
https://t.co/ZS755KxUebI’m a big advocate for Veterans Treatment Courts, which provide an alternative to jail &amp; connect veterans with counseling. We’ve already had success with them in Great Falls, Missoula &amp; Billings and I’m very excited to add Bozeman to that list. #mtpol
