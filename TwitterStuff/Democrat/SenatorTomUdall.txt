The Senate came together in bipartisan fashion to pass my amendment preserving critical protections for children and farmworkers--people who work day in and day out to feed our nation &amp; the world. https://t.co/Zn5oslTrltThe #CapitalGazette shooting is a horrifying tragedy. My thoughts are with the victims, their loved ones, &amp; all affected by this appalling act.

Now more than ever, every public official must speak up to defend the free press. And we must act to end such senseless gun violence.If the McConnell rule was in place in the 2016 election year, it should be in place in 2018. Given @POTUS' attacks on due process and the rule of law, we should let the people speak before we consider his next #SCOTUS nominee.WATCH LIVE: I’m speaking on the Senate floor about my visit to the border to hold @POTUS accountable for his immoral family separation policy. We cannot rest until every child has been reunited with their parents in a humane way. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/6Ggn2U810wHistory has shown that unions raise incomes, sustain our families, and lead to stronger communities. #SCOTUS today did the opposite, and made a rigged system worse for working families and a shrinking middle class. #Janus https://t.co/hyocTKZiknWATCH LIVE: I'm about to testify in @senjudiciary to call for bipartisan legislation to provide justice and compensation to all New Mexicans, Native Americans, and families affected by exposure to radiation during the Cold War. https://t.co/fkJENOFTvhPeople in #NM and across the country unknowingly sacrificed their health and even their lives to our national security efforts during the Cold War. We can’t undo the years of suffering they endured, but Congress must act to deliver justice and compensation to these victims.Tomorrow in @senjudiciary, I'll be fighting for justice for victims of radiation exposure who have been unjustly denied compensation under RECA for far too long--including the Tularosa Basin Downwinders &amp; the post-1971 uranium workers in Northwestern #NM. https://t.co/mjE0S3P4n5At the border, I saw firsthand the humanitarian crisis that the president has created with his immoral family separation policy. @POTUS needs to immediately communicate how he plans to reunite these thousands of children with their mothers and fathers. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/rcdL7AeNPPJill &amp; I were deeply saddened to learn that Lt. Christopher Short lost his life in a crash at @HollomanAFB. We offer our sincere condolences to his family &amp; loved ones, &amp; extend our tremendous gratitude for Lt. Short's service to our country in the @USNavy https://t.co/MGc1lKFl2gThe Trump administration owes the American people answers about how they are going to fix this disaster. @POTUS should come to the border—to places like #Tornillo—to see for himself the crisis he created. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/6pE2xxcMWMWe came to the border to demand answers about @POTUS’ un-American #FamilySeparation policy. We’re asking the same questions that people all across this country are asking. Most urgently: where is the administration’s plan to reunite these children with their families? https://t.co/DzArqhKZx5I returned to #Tornillo to tour the tent site where children are being detained, separated from their families by the Trump administration. Today is the first time that the administration has allowed members of Congress in to tour this facility. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/WYy5jqVfCoA truly moving show of solidarity  tonight in Las Cruces, #NM, where hundreds came out for our #KeepFamiliesTogether unity event. We’re speaking out with one voice--to say that our nation is better than this president's inhumane immigration policies. https://t.co/2SVeM2Udm9When we return to Washington, we will do so with renewed energy--to hold the president accountable for #FamilySeparation and demand that these children be reunited with their families. This should have never happened in the United States of America. https://t.co/DAnD3G2barWe're at #Tornillo because of the children. @POTUS says he's ended family separation. But these kids are still separated from their families. What's the administration's plan to reunite these thousands of children with their mothers and fathers? https://t.co/VB7FqKwjOFNo executive order can undo the life-long trauma that @POTUS’ family separation policy has caused these children--in #Tornillo and at other facilities across the country. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWe’ve arrived at the Trump tent city in #Tornillo, TX, where children who have been separated from their mothers and fathers are being detained. Today, it will be over 100 degrees in #Tornillo. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Dbp1P0W8YaNew Mexicans and Americans have spoken up in force. We won’t stand for family separation. We won’t rest until every child is reunited with their parents – and until we find a humane path forward for these families. We’re here to demand answers. #FamiliesBelongTogether.HAPPENING NOW: I'm on the border with @MartinHeinrich &amp; @SenBlumenthal to hold the Trump administration accountable for its inhumane #FamilySeparation policy and cruel immigration agenda. #FamilesBelongTogetherAnd I opposed the @DHSgov funding bill because we need to reunite the thousands of children and families that have been cruelly separated by @POTUS’ #FamilySeparation policy.Today in @SenateApprops, I voted NO on funding @POTUS’ border wall. Congress needs to rein in President Trump's cruel immigration agenda. https://t.co/eafC8WOXEiPresident Trump could end the appalling #FamilySeparation crisis he created with a stroke of a pen – but this executive order doesn’t do that. https://t.co/DyHvCrUMOxAmericans will not tolerate separating babies and toddlers from their parents and sending them to detention facilities. Here’s more proof that the president could completely end his own horrific policy with the stroke of a pen. #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/aieoUao5VR.@MartinHeinrich and I are going to the border to demand answers on @POTUS’ unconscionable #FamilySeparation policy. ↓ https://t.co/oSLCHQ2LaZI'm glad the #FY19NDAA includes my measure to strengthen the Burn Pits Registry, and study phasing out burn pits completely. @SenBobCorker &amp; I passed a law to create the registry to help veterans affected by burn pit exposure, like #NM's Jessey Baca, heal. https://t.co/AgDcoOA7fSI voted YES on the #FY19NDAA. The bill gives a well-deserved pay raise to our men and women in uniform--and it includes several provisions I championed to benefit #NM’s veterans, military families, bases and labs. https://t.co/dMG7eoM59lWith one phone call, @POTUS could end this horrific policy. If he won’t—then Congress must step in. 

Every Senate Democrat supports the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. It’s time for Republicans in Congress to join us to #EndFamilySeparation.This is shameful. We won’t stand by as President Trump holds defenseless children hostage for his offensive border wall. https://t.co/2AGDlpRBLhI won’t stop fighting until the Trump administration stops tearing children from the arms of their mothers and fathers, and until these families are reunited. If @POTUS won’t change course, then Congress needs to step in and pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. https://t.co/99VEUBWbjULet me be clear: @POTUS could end this morally repugnant policy in a matter of minutes. But instead, he’s using these defenseless children as a bargaining chip to try and build his wall. #EndFamilySeparationYes, this is a moral showdown – and we won’t back down. The president must immediately reverse his horrifying policy separating children from their mothers and fathers. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/23fWiO9uCU.@EPA and @HHSGov have a job to look out for public health. Our amendment requires transparency from these agencies – the public has a right to know about the risks posed by chemicals in their water. https://t.co/j0Gm1BhEa7 https://t.co/kCFZDK2UkrAmericans should be able to trust their government to do everything it can to protect our families’ health &amp; safety. But how can they, when they hear reports of secretive efforts to block the release of information about widespread water contamination?
 
https://t.co/5IzRU5lKS7Good luck to @NIFNM as they wrap up day 4 of their 31st annual Festival Flamenco in #ABQ. Flamenco is part of the fabric of #NM's culture and creative economy and I am thankful for the work @NMIF does to preserve and promote flamenco’s artistry, history, and culture. ¡Olé!I also announced funding I helped secure for NM’s public lands, Indian Country, and environmental  protection.Today on 'Tuesdays with Tom,' I discussed the Trump administration’s cruel policy on separating children from their parents.

https://t.co/SOv9I96vuWThe SW Chief is an engine of economic growth in NM that connects our rural communities. On @SenateApprops, I'm fighting to ensure NM has access to funding and a seat at the table as we work to keep the SW Chief chugging long into the future.
 
https://t.co/oLBI134mpf“There is no clear or compelling justification – in our past or in our laws – for taking an average of 47 kids per day away from their mothers and fathers. Such a policy is cruel. It is morally reprehensible.”

@POTUS must listen to border states like #NM &amp; end this cruel policy. https://t.co/z2ifx68LuvMUST READ: 1 of many stories of children suffering under @POTUS' cruel policy. #FamiliesTornApart
 
"The first few nights, he cried himself to sleep. Then it turned into just 'moaning and moaning'...He recently slept through the night for the first time."

https://t.co/PP6dbEt0i1U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw says the practice of separating children from their parents at the border is "brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency."
 
I agree. #FamiliesBelongTogether
 
https://t.co/1m0zV7tDGP.@POTUS' decision to separate children from their parents at the border is cruel, unnecessary &amp; goes against our American values - and is causing life-long trauma to children who are fleeing extreme violence. @POTUS must end family separation immediately. https://t.co/DHTcWsxcbxA record number of members of Congress have signed on to my resolution calling for Scott Pruitt to resign.

Updates and information can be found at https://t.co/4BBIJn0E51.This cozy relationship is a slam dunk deal for Scott Pruitt and for the big polluters. Meanwhile, American families are paying the price. 

The corruption at EPA needs to end. #Pruitt needs to resign.Now we learn @EPAScottPruitt sat in the VIP seats of a coal baron whose industry Pruitt is supposed to be regulating.
 
And then big polluters got their wish list: rollbacks of the critical environmental protections that keep your air and water clean. https://t.co/x3eWqfvhXVCongratulations to the hard-working “crew” at @LaPostaMesilla for this special recognition!

Today, we honor the resilience and courage of the Navajo people in the face of great injustices &amp; mistreatmentToday, I was deeply honored to commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Navajo Nation Treaty of 1868 with President Russel Begaye, Vice President Jonathan Nez and leaders and community members from throughout the Navajo Nation. https://t.co/POLplzr7o7President Trump should end his cruel &amp; inhumane policy of family separation. In the first 13 days of the policy alone, there are reports that 658 kids were separated from their families. Separating children from their parents is traumatic and it is wrong. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThe updated death toll out of Puerto Rico is a devastating indictment of our inadequate response to Hurricane Maria. The Trump administration failed our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico.

They make politicians more concerned with what their campaign donors want than what their constituents need.

Our historic resolution sends an unequivocal message to the administration: the American people have lost faith in Pruitt, and it’s time for him to go. #BootPruitt https://t.co/xsDKKC3pwnJill and I were deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Albuquerque's Jennifer Riordan today. Her charity and kindness touched so many lives in the community and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this difficult time.I questioned the chief of the National Guard Bureau about @POTUS’ move to send National Guard members to the border with Mexico. The facts on the ground and the accounts of local law enforcement just don’t support what the president has called for. https://t.co/TvKXfTZrW5.@MClyburnFCC has been a champion for closing the digital divide @FCC. She broke barriers and never stopped fighting for the good of American families. I’ve been honored to work alongside her to expand broadband &amp; opportunity across NM &amp; America—she'll be missed at the Commission https://t.co/9tt0uyvYKB.@EPASCottPruitt has more questions to answer about why a Colorado Springs industry group paid for his hotel stay after the Trump administration began working on their issues. https://t.co/8RtuDZ9tS6An illegal privacy booth to conduct secret discussions with his polluter friends does nothing to help our health or environment. #Pruitt is behaving like Swamp emperor rather than EPA administrator. He has been a disaster, and it’s past time for him to go.In response to my request w/ @BettyMcCollum04, @USGAO found @EPAScottPruitt violated federal law with his $43,000 "privacy booth"—another example of how he's breaking laws &amp; ethics rules that protect taxpayers from government waste, fraud &amp; abuse to help himself to perks &amp; favors https://t.co/EnstFPyMviSporadic strikes aren’t in our national security interest &amp; haven’t sent Assad running-they have emboldened him. We can’t afford endless war in the region. Military action won't solve the conflict in #Syria; that will take diplomatic engagement in the region &amp; w/ Assad’s allies..@POTUS must seek a new authorization from Congress to wage war in #Syria. I will continue to push Congress to debate and pass an #AUMF and require the administration to fully explain its strategy, and the cost, impact on American troops, and the parameters of its plans in Syria.This isn’t reality TV — tough talk with no long-term strategy puts the Syrian people, American troops, and our allies in danger. The U.S can’t afford to be dragged deeper into the Syrian civil war, and doing so risks a great power conflict.Assad’s violence is horrendous, &amp; he must be held to account by the international community for the many thousands of his fellow Syrians he has murdered. But @POTUS is dangerously escalating the situation in #Syria by acting w/ no legal authority &amp; no consistent, thoughtful plan.I'm voting against Mike Pompeo. We need a secretary of state who has the will &amp; vision to bring this admin. back from the brink, so that we can meet the unprecedented challenges facing America &amp; the world. Pompeo will validate &amp; encourage @POTUS' worst, most dangerous instincts. https://t.co/EnPeM81QAYOn #YomHashoah we remember the 6 million Jews murdered during the Holocaust, reflect on the suffering wrought by violent bigotry and renew our commitment to educate future generations about this tragedy—so the world never again tolerates hatred against any group of people.While President Trump wages war on the rule of law, we must have principled leaders at the highest levels of government who are willing to stand against his reckless and tyrannical behavior. Today, #Pompeo refused to commit to do what’s right.I pressed #Pompeo to answer whether he would speak up or refuse to serve if Trump forced a constitutional crisis by firing #Rosenstein or #Mueller. He wouldn’t answer. https://t.co/KDA2Qes2bHUnder my questioning at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mike Pompeo changed his tune on Iran and affirmed its compliance with #JCPOA. 
But #WhichPompeo is going to be serving at @StateDept—the one who believes in diplomacy first, or military strikes? https://t.co/E10XCeb19gI’m headed to the Senate floor to urge the Senate to delay Andrew Wheeler’s nomination for Deputy EPA Administrator. Given @EPAScottPruitt’s many ethical problems, we should give Wheeler the thorough vetting a future administrator would get. WATCH LIVE: https://t.co/eTjc9XVD72I’m about to question Mike Pompeo about his record and his fitness to lead @StateDept. Watch live: https://t.co/JMRSMO8aLIAny move to obstruct this investigation must be met with a swift rebuke by a bipartisan Congress and the American people.I’m glad to finally see more GOP lawmakers raise concerns about @POTUS firing Special Counsel Mueller or Rod Rosenstein in an attempt to interfere with the Russia investigation. https://t.co/k9jIl4XnwAReminder to @realDonaldTrump and his staff: any attempt to fire Special Counsel Mueller would violate a stated directive from Congress. https://t.co/ody556s8LQScott Pruitt seems to spend his time at EPA working on anything EXCEPT keeping our air and water clean and defending our health and safety. It’s time for him to go. https://t.co/K8eMZH4FHLMaking decisions on people’s lives and careers in a closed room of political staff with no notes, criteria or information is not how we run government.12 of the SES employees believe they were reassigned because they did work on climate change, energy, or conservation. These career public servants were only doing their jobs &amp; should be celebrated for their service without regard to the administration they serve. My statement: https://t.co/0YYMuCyZenThese moves also disproportionately impacted Native Americans, with 11 Native American employees targeted in this wave of reassignments. Diversity is a good thing. @Interior should be looking to cultivate and celebrate, not denigrate, its diverse workforce.I'm deeply disturbed by the IG's report on the reassignment of @Interior employees. Agency leaders punished career staff who were working on issues that contradicted the administration's anti-science agenda, particularly its climate denial campaign. https://t.co/IvjkKzUn4RGiven the public &amp; private disapproval of @EPAScottPruitt's conduct by Republican &amp; Democrat lawmakers alike, Andrew Wheeler's nomination to serve as Deputy Administrator should be delayed to ensure he receives the same thorough vetting process a EPA Administrator would receive.Next week, I’ll introduce a resolution calling on Pruitt to resign. It’s time for Pruitt’s imperial tenure to end—he has committed some of the worst ethical transgressions of the entire Trump administration, and that’s saying a lot. https://t.co/zFdZJUuuM0Thank you to @SenatorCarper @SenSchumer @SenMarkey @SenBennetCO @SenJeffMerkley @SenWhitehouse for joining me today to hold @EPAScottPruitt accountable for his unethical behavior and dangerous agenda at EPA. Watch our press conference: https://t.co/VBZVO494V7 https://t.co/UZBjB1UmMlWATCH LIVE: @SenateDems are holding Scott Pruitt accountable for his reckless tenure at EPA. He’s put corporate profits ahead of guarding our health and safety while brazenly spending taxpayer money on himself. He should resign today. https://t.co/5VsMslls8GToday, I pressed Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg about whether he will be a strong advocate for changes in the law, like the #HonestAdsAct, and work to prevent future attempts to interfere in our elections https://t.co/JCIro6iHaXI'm pressing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about his company's failure to protect Americans’ data and how Facebook plans to protect consumers’ privacy. Watch the full committee hearing live: https://t.co/SAeoRZBBUDThe gender wage gap hurts #NM women, families and our economy. But this isn't just about economics—it's about our commitment to advancing equality and protecting against discrimination.

Maile—welcome to a wonderful family and a great state. https://t.co/H7yu96W39p.@EPAScottPruitt’s conduct in office raises serious questions about whose interests he was putting first—America's or his own. He should resign. https://t.co/mB1YiVTmnIWhen Cesar &amp; Dolores founded NFWA, they founded a civil rights movement to protect the health, safety &amp; working conditions of America's farm laborers. I’m fighting now to protect farmworkers from Pruitt &amp; Trump’s attempt to permit the use of the dangerous pesticide #chlorpyrifosGreat #CesarChavezDay celebration in #ABQ today with civil rights hero Dolores Huerta. Their work made a difference for millions of farm workers &amp; showed us that—if we come together—our voices will be heard, change will come, and people’s lives will be made better. ¡Sí, se puede! https://t.co/WdAQ6fynI9I join all of Hawaii in mourning the passing of Sen. Akaka, former Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. He will be remembered as a gracious statesman &amp; advocate for our Nation’s indigenous people. My condolences go out to his family, friends &amp; the Native Hawaiian community.Taxpayers demand that public officials put our nation’s interests first. Scott Pruitt has shown time &amp; again he is more interested in using his power to help himself, his campaign donors &amp; his industry friends than protecting our health and safety. It’s time for him to resign.In his interview with Fox News yesterday, @EPAScottPruitt insisted that the lobbyist who gave him a sweetheart deal on a posh DC apartment “has no clients who have business before [EPA]”. That wasn't true. https://t.co/7iCtniXhQCThis afternoon, @CBSNews reported that a 16 year veteran of the EPA was reassigned from Pruitt's detail less than 2 weeks after refusing to run lights &amp; sirens for a non-emergency https://t.co/I5pVRL60t1Today, I called on Pruitt to resign, saying there's "no sign we’ve reached the end" of revelations about his unethical behavior.
 
Now, NYT is reporting 5 separate EPA career &amp; political officials were reassigned or demoted after confronting Pruitt about his spending &amp; management https://t.co/ccqoFVH8AeI always believed Pruitt would be a disaster for health &amp; safety, but I've been shocked at how brazenly he has abused the taxpayers’ trust &amp; his office. 
 
It’s past time for him to go. I'll introduce a resolution soon calling on him to resign for the good of the American people.But that isn’t all—he's done this while making a mockery of ethics laws that protect taxpayers from government waste and fraud. He's taken $100,000s from taxpayers &amp; spent it on perks for himself, while trying to slash the budget for the EPA's critical health &amp; safety programs..@EPAScottPruitt should resign. Over the last year, he has waged a war on America's health and safety, dismantling protections from neurotoxic pesticides, dangerous air &amp; water pollution, greenhouse gases &amp; hazardous chemicals—all for the benefit of his donors &amp; industry cronies. https://t.co/SeSa3axmni.@POTUS is trying to distract attention from his own chaos: stock market disruption, trade war w/ China, saber rattling w/ North Korea, sexual misconduct allegations, news of @EPAScottPruitt improperly spending taxpayer $$ on himself, &amp;, of course, Russia. https://t.co/jc456oomsYWe’re demanding @EPAScottPruitt provide answers and documents about his ethically questionable rental arrangement with energy lobbyists who had business before @EPA. Government officials must carry out their duties without undue influence or conflicts of interest. https://t.co/SnOhuHrOJ8I stand with New Mexico families and businesses who oppose @realDonaldTrump's offensive effort to militarize the border and build an obscenely expensive and ineffective wall in our backyard. https://t.co/3g5BZfZt2f50 years after Dr. King's assassination, we remember his fearless leadership and dedication to ending racial and social injustice—and we recommit ourselves to finishing what he started by fighting poverty and inequality in all their forms. #MLK50 https://t.co/PqtzY5C7jqInnovative idea, Las Cruces. Committing to 100% renewable energy supply by 2050 will produce cleaner air and lower energy bills. Great example of how #NM cities can work to combat climate change. https://t.co/WjbTuwvXuW@EPAScottPruitt: please use taxpayer dollars to protect clean drinking water, not to pad salaries of your friends. https://t.co/0MGOhRX75YPresident Trump ended DACA last year and repeatedly rejected bipartisan attempts to #ProtectDREAMers.

Tune into KRWG tonight at 7:30 or watch my interview here: https://t.co/5jt5KTsW3hUndermining rules that protect #NM families from predatory payday lending schemes is a dangerous mistake. @CFPB was created to protect consumers, not do the payday loan industry’s bidding. Were calling on CFPB to stop rolling back rules that hold predatory businesses accountable. https://t.co/bPKnQGVcaJSince Pruitt won’t protect kids’ health, I’ve introduced a bill to #BanChlorpyrifos to protect the safety of kids, farmworkers and farm communities.#Chlorpyrifos residue is regularly found on fruits and vegetables at the grocery store, exposing children to a chemical linked to brain damage in kids. I’m asking American grocery stores and restaurants whether they source produce from farmers who use this dangerous pesticide. https://t.co/OuBfGB2VtrOne year ago today, @EPAScottPruitt reversed the government’s ban on the dangerous neurotoxic pesticide #chlorpyrifos and put chemical corporation profits ahead of the health and safety of our children, rural communities and farmworkers. https://t.co/x5Xvuq4Q4xProud to have worked on the Appropriations Committee to defeat poison pill

Proud to have secured the biggest increase in child care funding in history in the #Omnibus—this is great news for #NM families who are struggling to find affordable, quality child care.Ending this funding crisis has been a priority of mine for many years. This long-term funding fix is an urgently needed solution for New Mexico and other Southwestern states as they begin yet another fire season and another year of drought. https://t.co/U5N0u23BryVery pleased that the #omnibus finally ends the cycle of "fire borrowing”—now @forestservice can afford to fight severe fires and do important work to keep forests healthy, prevent fires and protect #NM's communities &amp; watersheds. https://t.co/jZYrg0V8UHI talked with @PlanetMoney about why we need to reform a 150 year old law that has allowed big mining corporations to rip off taxpayers for too long. #miningreform https://t.co/fboX5W3nZOThe #omnibus has some great wins for the health and safety of New Mexicans and people in every community across America: https://t.co/ahsjKP6L0xAnd we increased funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which supports community efforts to create parks and open space from community ballfields to national parks.We increased funding for critical and beloved arts and cultural programs in communities big and small all across this country thanks to the National Endowments for the arts and humanities.We rejected Trump and Scott Pruitt’s plan to cripple the EPA, by providing stable funding, protecting scientists, and saving programs like the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), the critical EPA program relied on worldwide for assessments of toxic chemicals.We defeated poison pill riders that would have gutted our bedrock environmental and conservation laws.When we set to work on the Interior &amp; Environment Appropiations budget, we listened to your priorities—clean air &amp; water, protections against toxic substances, more parks &amp; arts opportunities for our kids &amp; continued community safety. Together, we delivered—here are some wins: https://t.co/bPOKcx78xm.@POTUS' chaotic, inconsistent, offensive foreign policy has diminished our position abroad &amp; emboldened dictators.

WATCH: https://t.co/wxllODch6qThe opioid crisis is devastating communities across New Mexico &amp; America every day. Suffering families need expanded access to treatment and prevention programs. What I saw from @POTUS today was more talk and misplaced threats, and no real action or commitment to needed funding. https://t.co/b1WDEi4xrfOnce again—all Americans should call on Republican leaders in Congress to send a clear message to @POTUS that we will not tolerate any attempt to derail Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. https://t.co/l9UiaxSZ8e.@EPA appears to be stonewalling @USGAO's investigation into @EPAScottPruitt’s $43,000 “privacy booth.” Taxpayers deserve to know if their money is being spent legally and responsibly.

It's the moral test of our age, and we'll be judged by future generations on how we respond. We can't afford to sit back and do nothing—as @SenWhitehouse says, it's #TimeToWakeUp. Watch my speech: https://t.co/3tUdgtIqTU https://t.co/pTjwujsjf1Farmworkers are exposed to dangerous chemicals and even bring toxins home to their families. Now Scott Pruitt &amp; the EPA want to prevent them from getting access to nonproprietary safety information on the pesticides they’re exposed to. RT if you agree he should reconsider.Pesticides like #chlorpyrifos have been linked to brain damage in children—even residue on fruit at the grocery store is a danger. So why are Scott Pruitt &amp; the EPA trying to weaken standards that prevent kids under age 18 from applying pesticides? We’re urging him to reconsider. https://t.co/vLvW9dWoS1My statement about chaos at the State Department and President Trump’s decision to nominate CIA Director Pompeo to Secretary of State and elevate CIA Deputy Director Haspel: https://t.co/wu0dS5ptSMWhat infrastructure investments do you think would help move our state forward?

You can hear a recording of the call here: https://t.co/OweeNXnvpCOur bill is a forward-looking proposal that emphasizes conservation and development of the 2nd-generation of advanced biofuels. It would put us on a cleaner, more sustainable path to combat the urgent threat of climate change, cut pollution and protect our planet.The environmental benefits of the RFS haven’t been realized. In fact, the standard that was intended to benefit the environment may well be hurting it.

My statement on @SenateDems infrastructure plan: https://t.co/oLPxu27UhrThank you, @SenThadCochran, for your years of service to the Senate, the Appropriations Committee, and the people of Mississippi. I wish you well.We should be making direct investments in the success of our country’s greatest asset, the American people—not writing giveaways to corporations and CEOs and hoping that it trickles down to working families. https://t.co/uRK9i5axYhPresident Trump and Republican leaders said their tax bill would help working people, but big corporations are using the #GOPTaxScam to line executives and shareholders’ pockets at a record rate—not passing the benefits on to workers. 
https://t.co/16UUEHJ7ff#DREAMers are not bargaining chips, they are real people with families, jobs and aspirations. They deserve protection and certainty—not more political gamesmanship from @POTUS and Republicans in Congress. #ProtectDREAMersToday is the arbitrary deadline @realDonaldTrump gave Congress to fix the mess he created for #DREAMers. @POTUS sabotaged a bipartisan deal by demanding his xenophobic border wall and attacking immigrant families. I stand with #DREAMers and their families for a #DREAMActNow.On Sept. 5, President Trump created a crisis for #DREAMers in #NM and across the country when he rescinded #DACA, and now these bright young people live in limbo. Congress must act to #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/Yz603owp2cNew Mexicans deserve a say in any proposed development on public lands in our state, especially when it is near sacred or culturally sensitive land. I welcome @SecretaryZinke's decision to terminate the #chacocanyon lease sale. 
https://t.co/B2VMGBnDKbI’m deeply concerned that, under @EPAScottPruitt, EPA is prioritizing speed of approval over public safety—the opposite of Congress' intent. This not only puts Americans at risk, it undermines the public faith that products &amp; ingredients have been rigorously reviewed to be safe.Americans deserve certainty that the products they buy at hardware &amp; grocery stores don’t endanger their families’ health. We passed #chemicalsafety reform to ensure the @EPA puts the safety of Americans ahead of the interests of chemical corporations.Thanks to @NickKristof for raising awareness about #chemicalsafety. Like him, I got my blood tested for chemicals, and found surprising results. 

Take his quiz to find out what dangerous chemicals you might be exposed to every day: https://t.co/IvjmzlXR2fEnjoyed talking with @WstrnPriorities about @SecretaryZinke’s first year at @Interior, why we need to keep standing up for our #publiclands, and the values my dad instilled in me about conservation. 

Listen to the podcast here: https://t.co/xWKG2ghFvuGlad to see the #MGTAct at work. The administration is now beginning the process of updating federal IT systems as mandated under our law. This will help address cybersecurity vulnerabilities and save taxpayers $20 billion a year. https://t.co/s2gjsj5HdSAs my friend Jennifer Gomez-Chavez said, to be American is to be "accepting of different beliefs, different cultures, different experiences...it's the spirit of helping those who are voiceless, helping those who need that extra hand and championing those who are succeeding.”#NM Rabbi Berel Levertov is right: "We are all part of the same country and it's a land of opportunity for everybody." The belief that every person—no matter their race, religion, class, or identity—deserves the chance to succeed is fundamental to our success and our future.These wonderful portraits of people across America, including 2 from #NM, provide an important reminder: more unites our country than divides us. We will only solve the problems that we face if we can come together to find real solutions.

https://t.co/BhOhCv52DBDuring #BlackHistoryMonth, we recognize the immeasurable &amp; indelible contributions that African Americans have made to #NM &amp; our nation. And we must recognize that—long after slavery &amp; Jim Crow—too many communities still face systemic obstacles to equality, justice &amp; opportunity. https://t.co/4GDIIV5j6UThis week, I had the chance to meet with #NM Tribes and Pueblos to discuss how we can work together to advance Tribal communities' priorities. As vice chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I am committed to ensuring Tribal communities' voices are heard and represented in DC. https://t.co/oRwxJqS1ztThese indictments represent an extensive accounting of Russian meddling in 2016. This is a reminder of what's at stake in this November’s election &amp; the future. Congress must act to protect the special counsel's investigation &amp; DAG Rosenstein from political interference by the WH https://t.co/eRqNwZqCUQGreat meeting with @RMYouthCorps, Conservation Corps #NM and SW Conservation Corps. These groups inspire young New Mexicans and veterans to serve and protect our #publiclands for generations to come. I’m proud to support their work as a @TheCorpsNetwork Congressional Champion. https://t.co/pqRUJAGWkXHad a good conversation with @CompTIA team from #NM about the important role the technology industry plays in growing New Mexico's economy and workforce. I’m working to ensure our students get the #STEM educations they need to compete and excel in the 21st century economy. https://t.co/q8So34CxPUToday, I held an Indian Affairs Cmmtte listening session on higher ed. to gather input from Tribal Colleges &amp; Native students—as Congress considers several impt higher ed-related bills, I hope this feedback will result in real commitment to elevating &amp; advancing Tribal prioritiesDuring National Tribal Colleges &amp; Universities Week, we honor of the critical role these institutions play in helping Native students across the country get a high-quality education that enables them to succeed after graduation &amp; continue contributing to their Tribal communities. https://t.co/z9t6pA3MhFThis week I met with @aihec members to discuss advancing the important work done by Tribal colleges, universities &amp; teachers. I’m proud to work with them to ensure Native students gain skills they need to succeed after graduation while embracing their Native languages &amp; cultures.I voted no on wasting $25B on an offensive wall on our border. I stand with NM families who oppose @POTUS' effort to impose his xenophobic agenda on our state. New Mexicans of all political backgrounds overwhelmingly support DREAMers and oppose a wall in our backyard.I voted for Coons-McCain, a bipartisan bill to #ProtectDreamers without wasting billions on an offensive wall. @RealDonaldTrump created this crisis for DREAMers. Now @POTUS and Republican leaders are doing everything to stop us from fixing it.An inaccurate census risks underrepresentation for Tribal communities. An undercount can lead to skewed state, local &amp; federal voting districts and inequitable allocation of federal funding. This makes it all the more important we get the 2020 census right.WATCH: Today I led a hearing on improving the census in Indian Country. Valid and accurate census data is the bedrock of fair, proportionate representation in our democracy, and it’s critical Tribal communities’ voices are heard and accurately represented.
https://t.co/3JE0DljoKhMy heart breaks again today at news of the school shooting in Florida. It's long past time for action to stop the gun violence claiming our children's lives. My thoughts are with the community and victims of this tragedy, and I'm so grateful for the first responders on the scene.Proud to work with @WereNIEA to expand Native language opportunities, provide support for teachers in Indian Country and secure greater funding for school construction and maintenance. Together, we’re making a difference for the next generation of Tribal leaders—Native students. https://t.co/Qes6M7hc5TI’ll be thinking about families like Gary’s as well as #DREAMers and other immigrants I’ve met with in New Mexico as I fight to preserve our nation's proud immigrant history. #ProtectDreamersAs we begin the Senate debate about immigration, I wanted to share my recent conversation with #ABQ native @whoisgarylee about the power of the American Dream and how immigrants make America strong.
 
Gary told his inspiring story on Twitter last month: https://t.co/x1bDxjxoPT https://t.co/MOC1evq55PWith the #MethaneRule in place, US drilling rig activity is at its highest level in 3 years. And US oil production is projected to reach a record high in 2018. Strong evidence this common-sense rule isn't hurting the industry.The proposal from @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SecretaryZinke to gut the #MethaneRule designed to limit the wasteful venting and flaring of natural gas would hurt taxpayers, school children, #NM's economy, and our environment. https://t.co/aFaPHQt7Ya#DREAMers are as American as you or me. They are nurses, firefighters, neighbors, leaders, friends. They contribute to our communities every day, and they deserve the opportunity to continue pursuing their dreams. 

Here are a few of their stories. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/iC8vxdDjTlThe Senate is beginning its immigration debate today, and I'll be fighting every step of the way to protect #DREAMers.
 
Our efforts must reflect America's proud immigrant history and preserve the diversity and opportunity—for all—that is our greatest strength.#TrumpBudget is an assault on our children’s future. @POTUS has proposed massive cuts to education funding, teacher training, after school programs &amp; student loans. 

These cuts would reverse the investments we've made to give every kid a chance to get a good education &amp; succeed.#TrumpBudget is an assault on working families, slashing Medicare &amp; Medicaid, repealing #ACA &amp; taking away health care from hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans &amp; millions of Americans. We should be investing in helping working families get ahead, not undercutting their future.#TrumpBudget repeats the same toxic attacks on working families’ health care and livelihoods that the American people resoundingly rejected last year. 
 
It makes it clear where @POTUS stands—on the side of wealthy and powerful people like him, and against working New Mexicans. https://t.co/a3Gmq2Ttjy#TrumpBudget would undercut #publiclands protections &amp; wipe out the #LWCF, which funds conservation across America, fuels the $887B outdoor recreation industry &amp; creates jobs. This is an assault on our #NationalParks &amp; #PublicLands, treasured places that belong to all Americans..@POTUS’ budget proposal would slash EPA programs that keep our air &amp; water clean &amp; protect our communities from deadly pollution &amp; dangerous chemicals. I’m fighting for a healthy future for our kids, not a lucrative future for Pruitt’s polluter friends. https://t.co/cmRngPG8saWe've made important progress in combatting violence against Native women—but there’s a lot of work left to do. I’m co-chairing an Indian Affairs Committee listening session about #VAWA to gather input from Tribes on implementing &amp; improving this landmark legislation. #SOIN2018Disturbed by this leaked @Interior report showing @SecretaryZinke’s intention to steamroll environmental protections in order to increase drilling and mining on our #publiclands. https://t.co/QBXFDRplogI'm honored to be delivering the Congressional Response to National Congress of American Indians President Jefferson Keel's 2018 State of Indian Nations Address. Watch the whole NCAI executive council winter conference here: https://t.co/SPOppLHZMi #SOIN2018We’re demanding the White House explain why Rob Porter had access to classified information even after the Chief of Staff was notified he was denied a security clearance because of an alleged history of domestic violence. https://t.co/IKwsahaNL8Too many Native American kids face challenges like hunger, obesity &amp; diabetes. Our bill gives Tribes authority to serve their communities’ nutritional needs and ensures students have access to healthy foods so they can focus on their education and not worry about their next meal. https://t.co/spdTI7nLd4With this agreement, the Senate moves to a fair, open immigration debate. We must act urgently to protect the future of #DREAMers. I stand with @HouseDemocrats in asking for a similar process from Speaker Paul Ryan.#NM working families shouldn’t have to worry about the future of their health care. Proud to have secured multi-year funding for #communityhealthcenters, the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, #CHIP &amp; the Maternal, Infant &amp; Early Childhood Home Visiting program in this budget.This budget agreement will benefit #NM &amp; America. It ensures long-term funding for critical health care programs that #NM working families need. It means strong funding for #NM labs and bases, supports our veterans and devotes critical resources to the battle against opioids. https://t.co/5l5KWORYiGRead our statement on the racist political cartoon about DREAMers that appeared in the Albuquerque Journal: https://t.co/bbqisU6MWOThis is absurd, even from Pruitt. The Department of Defense has called #climatechange a significant threat to global stability and national security. Ask Western farmers and ranchers whether rising temperatures and drought are going to help arid areas like #NM (or Oklahoma). https://t.co/Qlisdy4rRKWords and images are still hateful and offensive, even when they appear in a cartoon. The @ABQJournal should apologize.WATCH LIVE: I'm on the Senate floor calling on Congress to #ProtectMueller and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and defend the rule of law and the integrity of our elections. 

Now is the time for every member of Congress to put the country ahead of politics. https://t.co/CskBOZ9veFI'm on my way to the Senate floor to call on Congress to pass legislation that protects Special Counsel Mueller from being fired by @realDonaldTrump.

The Special Counsel must be able to do his job, follow the facts, and deliver the American people the answers they deserve.#MonumentsForAll like #OMDP4NM are a part of our cultural heritage and our way of life, and they bring important economic benefits to the surrounding communities. It’s critical we keep them protected for generations to come.WATCH LIVE: I’m testifying to @EnergyDems about my Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Conservation Act, a bill to protect wilderness in #OMDP4NM to enhance recreational opportunities, preserve traditional hunting uses &amp; protect sensitive archeological sites. https://t.co/uhqZxa6g64#CommunityHealthCenters provide affordable health care to our most vulnerable citizens, including more than 325,000 in #NM. We need to fund this vital program NOW. https://t.co/8Srfw4WcXCI’m joining with a bipartisan group of senators calling for immediate funding for #CommunityHealthCenters ↓ https://t.co/DlZlfAipy1Americans don’t support @realDonaldTrump’s xenophobic immigration demands &amp; they don’t want a shutdown. If he WANTED a solution, @POTUS could signal support for any of the bipartisan options on the table—but he’d rather throw bombs on TV than lead. This is totally irresponsible. https://t.co/K6GoJLeIdr.@ChrisCoons and @SenJohnMcCain’s bipartisan bill to protect #Dreamers is an example of the sort of compromise deal Congress can pass. @realDonaldTrump needs to stop politicking on xenophobic immigration rhetoric, find a seat at the table and make a deal.A large majority of Americans—across party lines—support protections for #Dreamers. And there are bipartisan deals on the table to achieve those protections immediately. So: are Republican leaders going to do the right thing or subject #Dreamers to more uncertainty and fear?#Dreamers strengthen our communities and our country every day. They are not political pawns—they are real people with jobs, families and aspirations. It’s time for Congress to preserve their dreams, protect their futures and pass the #DreamAct.Since 1997, SDPI has resulted in a 40% increase in the # of diabetes clinics in Native communities &amp; the CDC has observed a 54% decrease in diabetes-related kidney failures among American Indian &amp; Alaska Natives. It’s imperative we fund SDPI and keep building on this progress.The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) provides resources to treat &amp; prevent diabetes to over 300 Native American communities. I’m urging congressional leaders to reauthorize SDPI, protect Tribal health care &amp; preserve Indian Country's important progress on diabetes. https://t.co/uKZ1uJrPW3#CommunityHealthCenters employ 3,000 New Mexicans &amp; provide care for 325,000 in #NM. SDPI provides grants for 29 diabetes prevention &amp; management programs in #NM. It’s time for Congress to work together and come up with a solution that puts people’s health and wellbeing first. https://t.co/N0HrDq7Ib5The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) provides critical care to many New Mexicans and is making real progress combatting diabetes through treatment and education about exercise and healthy eating habits. But SDPI is at risk under this admin too. https://t.co/azJ9osEtAO#CommunityHealthCenters are the backbone of #NM health care. But while @POTUS &amp; Republicans were focused on giving tax cuts to millionaires &amp; corporations, funding for this vital program lapsed. I’m fighting to protect the care working families rely on. https://t.co/8Srfw4WcXCGreat roundtable today on the importance of funding #communityhealthcenters and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. I’m fighting hard in Congress to break the partisan divide over the budget and ensure these critical programs remain available to New Mexicans in need. https://t.co/FFHd244wmyToday I’m holding an #ABQ roundtable with Tribal &amp; community health care providers to discuss how Congress’ failure to fund the Community Health Centers Program &amp; Special Diabetes Program for Indians inhibits the delivery of quality care that New Mexico families rely on. https://t.co/cfA7v52ZrfI’m deeply concerned about how the BLM’s abrupt decision to shut out public input &amp; to dramatically weaken the oil &amp; gas leasing review process will impact @ChacoCultureNHP, an area of deep importance to the Navajo Nation &amp; several New Mexico Pueblos who consider the sites sacred https://t.co/NvSHZleYPIRT to support our #ANTIQUITIESActOf2018 to ensure no President can attempt to illegally eliminate national #monumentsforall! https://t.co/2UJmqaYOPY.It’s more urgent than ever for us to speak up for #MonumentsForAll and urge Congress to protect America’s heritage. Take action: https://t.co/oXLEgaastn #StandWithBearsEars #SaveGrandStaircaseToday's a dark day for #publiclands. #BearsEars &amp; #GrandStaircase are officially open to mining &amp; drilling claims after @POTUS' attack on their protections. Call on Congress to pass #ANTIQUITIESActof2018 NOW to protect our #MonumentsforAll from being sold to the highest bidder. https://t.co/doAvG7gKjWContinued inaction in the face of this destabilizing behavior is intolerable. It’s more urgent than ever for Senate Republicans to join Democrats in passing a bill to protect against the unjust removal of Special Counsel Mueller. We have a duty to act now before it is too late.Cherry picking information to smear the work of career law enforcement officials in order to protect @POTUS from Mueller’s investigation is a cowardly and hyper-partisan attack on Americans who've dedicated their lives to our national security.The Nunes Memo is the latest in an unprecedented, partisan attack on law enforcement agencies &amp; the Special Counsel. Every American should want to get to the bottom of Russian meddling—so why are @POTUS &amp; some in GOP doing everything they can to interfere with this investigation?Trump and GOP’s attacks on Mueller &amp; federal law enforcement are unprecedented. Any attempt to fire Mueller is a danger to national security. 

If Trump has nothing to hide, then why are some in the GOP hiding the real facts and smearing career FBI agents in a classified memo?The Nunes memo is part of a sustained effort by @POTUS &amp; GOP to undermine the Special Counsel’s Russia investigation. Their partisan attacks on Americans who have dedicated decades to protecting our nation endangers the rule of law and public confidence in our justice system. https://t.co/fzX5etfWdDCongrats to Diné College on its 50th anniversary! Diné—the oldest tribal college—provides a great education rooted in Diné language &amp; culture that empowers students to succeed after graduation and continue contributing to Navajo Nation, #NM and the U.S. 
https://t.co/SHhTL9WkCR.@POTUS' failure to hold Russia accountable for its attack on the foundation of our democracy—our free &amp; fair elections—is inexcusable and leaves us vulnerable. @SenateDems and I are demanding the administration explain why it won't implement sanctions that deter future meddling. https://t.co/2qln4nCrhs.@POTUS promised to #DrainTheSwamp, but he has filled his admin with people whose financial interests directly conflict with their duty to serve the people. Kudos to @Politico, but Rs in Congress need to do real oversight over the Trump Admin's corruption &amp; lack of transparency.The CDC Director is charged with protecting Americans’ health. 
 
Tobacco use is the leading cause of disease &amp; death in America. 
 
I welcome Dr. Fitzgerald's resignation. A CDC Director investing in tobacco is a textbook, outrageous conflict of interest—like so many in this WH. https://t.co/VVLyMqu09bMy thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in this morning’s awful train accident. I’m grateful for the swift action of my colleagues and first responders on the scene.New Mexicans want results – and they want real leadership that honors the values of the country they love. I’ll keep fighting the disastrous policies of the Trump administration and the Republican Congress, and working to chart a better course for our state and nation.Tonight, President Trump began by talking about setting aside our differences, yet he delivered a speech filled with hateful rhetoric demonizing immigrants and gave New Mexicans and Americans nothing to suggest he wants to move us from the dangerous course he has set. #SOTUOn my way to #SOTU. I'm wearing a purple ribbon tonight in honor of those suffering at the hands of the #OpioidCrisis. Addiction touches all of us and it's time for real action to address this public health crisis. https://t.co/eYINDYiKoPI want to work across the aisle with @POTUS to rebuild our aging infrastructure—but sending the bill to cash-strapped local governments and the middle class is NOT the approach we need to energize our economy. We need big, direct investments from the federal government. #SOTUTonight, I join @SenateDems in urging @POTUS to abandon his xenophobic demands on immigration, stop holding #Dreamers hostage &amp; back a true bipartisan policy that understands the diversity that is our nation's greatest strength. #SOTUThe #OpioidEpidemic is tearing apart families, killing 142 Americans every day, and states like #NewMexico need real funding to work on real solutions. Now, it's time for @POTUS to put his money where his mouth is so we can start saving lives. #SOTU.@POTUS should use #SOTU to remind Americans that there’s more that unites us than divides us, and that if we really work together we can end the opioid epidemic, protect DREAMers &amp; build the infrastructure local economies need to succeed.Americans overwhelmingly support protections for our #MonumentsForAll &amp; recognize the unmatched economic, recreational &amp; cultural benefits they bring to communities across our country. We won't stand for this administration's attacks on our natural heritage. #ANTIQUITIESActOf2018 https://t.co/FRpbnBNBJqThe Trump administration’s attack on #MonumentsForAll puts our country’s $887 billion outdoor economy at risk. Our #ANTIQUITIESActOf2018 will help ensure our #publiclands remain a source of recreation and good jobs for generations to come. #publiclands #keepitpublic https://t.co/qO6BKDeXg1.@POTUS' move to eliminate 2M acres of protections for #BearsEars &amp; #GrandStaircase Escalante is the largest attack on #publiclands in American history &amp; an insult to Tribes who've worked to protect this culturally significant region. We’re fighting back. #StandWithBearsEars https://t.co/0zkBVzaQD4RT if you support keeping public lands in public hands—not selling them off to the highest bidder. #KeepItPublic #ANTIQUITIESActOf2018 https://t.co/cUjPBRy0QiProud to fight alongside @SenatorDurbin @SenBlumenthal @RonWyden @MartinHeinrich @SenFeinstein @brianschatz @KamalaHarris @SenCortezMasto @SenDuckworth @SenGillibrand @maziehirono @SenJeffMerkley @SenatorCardin @CoryBooker @ChrisVanHollen @SenBennetCO @SenTinaSmith #KeepitPublicWe’re introducing the #ANTIQUITIESActOf2018 today to protect our #MonumentsForAll from the Trump administration’s unprecedented and illegal attacks on our #PublicLands. #KeepItPublic https://t.co/wBtBtooXqj.@POTUS declared the opioid epidemic a national emergency but has yet to provide real resources or take actions to improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. Americans need more than lip service. They need solutions that save lives..@MartinHeinrich &amp; I are calling on @POTUS to take real actions to fight the opioid epidemic that is ravaging communities in NM - and claiming 142 lives a day nationwide - by supporting $25 billion dollars in emergency funds ASAP to save lives. https://t.co/oU6cWpdUldDid you know the IRS uses a nearly 60-year-old computer code to process tax returns &amp; maintain highly sensitive taxpayer info?

My #MGTAct w/ @JerryMoran will update federal gov’t IT—like the IRS example—saving taxpayers $20B a year &amp; making us less vulnerable to cyber attack. https://t.co/q696X8hKnmThe America I love doesn’t insult our neighbors and then slam the door in the faces of people who seek shelter from oppression and the dream of a better life.The American people reject President Trump’s xenophobic politics of hate and division, and I will not accept a ‘take it or leave it’ offer on protection for DREAMers. The White House proposal is insulting, not a serious effort to reach a bipartisan consensus. #DreamActNow“Disinformation … thrives on the absence of healthy confrontation with other sources of information.” Well said. Americans deserve truth from their leaders, and the free press plays an essential role in keeping our government honest. https://t.co/55y8ORvgFGTrying to intimidate local governments by threatening to take away critical public safety funding will not keep our communities safe, and won't get us any closer to fixing our broken immigration system.
https://t.co/aQwqoLuDO3I voted no on Alex Azar's nomination. We shouldn't put American families' healthcare decisions in the hands of a former pharma exec who has opposed lowering drug prices &amp; refuses to acknowledge his former industry is to blame for skyrocketing prices that are hurting our families.We’re urging @SecretaryZinke to keep public lands in public hands and uphold his responsibility to prohibit the sale or transfer of America's treasured #publiclands. https://t.co/VTZcTKGUvZI’ve long been an advocate for a #NM constitutional amendment to invest in the most effective early child care and education programs, and I’ll continue to support efforts like these to ensure we are making the right investments in our children’s future.Investing in early childhood education is essential for getting kids on track to advance in school, graduate and pursue a higher education or a career. That’s why I’m encouraged by this proposal to make a proper investment in #NM early childhood education. https://t.co/LobqON5Jg3Great to meet Sergio today, a student from Pojoaque, &amp; students from across the country who are in DC for the @NAEvangelicals Christian Student Leadership Conference. We had an important discussion about protecting America's #publiclands &amp; staying civically engaged. https://t.co/9T0QK4UxktWhile this agreement opens up a path forward on the DREAM Act, I’m still fighting for a responsible bipartisan budget that funds our military &amp; domestic priorities for longer than a few weeks. This is Congress’ most basic job—I'll be working hard to get our gov't back on track.We still must work together to make progress. The American people don’t support President Trump’s platform of hate and division – and Democrats will not accept a ‘take it or leave it’ offer on immigration that will further tear this country apart.We have an agreement that isn’t perfect, but it is progress: it ends the #TrumpShutdown, extends the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years, and creates a credible path forward on the DREAM Act. https://t.co/kUVM6Gs0ejDemocrats are ready to end this chaotic and dangerous #TrumpShutdown. Mr. President: take yes for an answer. https://t.co/4lwjHrj7NODemocrats are pushing: 1) to fund the military &amp; civilian govt for more than a few weeks 2) to continue CHIP 3) for disaster aid 4) for @POTUS to fulfill his promise to show DREAMers “great heart.” ALL of these are bipartisan, so let’s work together &amp; end this #TrumpShutdown.Republicans control the House, Senate &amp; White House &amp; they have failed to do their most basic function—keep the government running. Democrats are ready to work with Trump and the GOP leaders on a deal as soon as they're ready to take yes for an answer &amp; end this #TrumpShutdown.Proud of the women and men in #NM and across America who—a year after the historic #WomensMarch—​are raising their voices this weekend and continuing to demand true equality, opportunity, and justice for every person in our country. https://t.co/jqpHYykPW4
