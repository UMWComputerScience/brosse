https://t.co/bRXSwiOwPQWe need to reverse the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality. The fight for a free and open internet continues in the People’s House.It is because of #NetNeutrality that entrepreneurs are able to start and grow their businesses online. We need to #SaveNetNeutrality and prevent Internet Service Providers from pricing these businesses out of the online marketplace.It is extremely disappointing that the Supreme Court upheld this shameful stain on our country. America should be better than this. History will not be kind to this decision.•History will look back on today's #SCOTUS decision as one where the court endorsed discrimination. #NoMuslimBanEverReligious freedom is a core American value. Today's decision flies in the face of that and puts the religious liberty of ALL Americans at risk. Join people of all faiths on the #SCOTUS steps at 11:45 today to affirm that #wewillnotbebanned. https://t.co/u3ZOMpq1cPlooking forward to it. https://t.co/wJM23D6DTc3,289 girls are in the unaccompanied alien children program.

On #WorldRefugeeDay, I join my colleagues to affirm our nation’s commitment to protect refugees.A strong nation builds bridges, not walls. Proud to support @RepTedLieu @RosLehtinen bill to reaffirm U.S. leadership in refugee crises #WRD2018@SRuhle keep doing the GREAT reporting that you are doing. What is happening at the Border is wrong!!!Republicans’ continued attempts to litigate the Clinton email investigation are based on incorrect, highly flawed, and cynical assumptions that are not borne out by facts. It's part of their playbook. #IGReport #IGHearing•The #IGReport found Loretta Lynch did not coordinate with #JamesComey and did not know what he would say in advance of the July 5, 2016, recommendation not to prosecute Secretary Clinton. #IGHearingMy favorite congressional baseball player is @CedricRichmond #CBG18  @QuorumAnalytics https://t.co/e5ocj0nTRSWant to thank @kennychesney  who will Donate All 'Songs for the Saints' Album Proceeds to Virgin Islands Hurricane Relief #VIStrong".@realDonaldTrump's tax breaks for wealthy corporation may have helped boost the stock market through record corporate stock buybacks. But when the richest 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks, this doesn't mean much for black and brown families across the country. #HiddenRules"The GOP tax law is a huge permanent tax break for wealthy corporations. @realDonaldTrump claims this won't flow into the pockets of predominantly white executives and shareholders, but we know the truth. #HiddenRulesHow will the #TrumpTax affect black workers across the country? #HiddenRules@DarrickHamilton and @MichaelSLinden: you mention in your recent article that wealth, not income, is a better predictor of family’s economic security. Can you explain why? #HiddenRulesRepublicans have stuck our children with the bill for their deficit-exploding giveaways to the wealthiest, and will use the enormous deficits they created to justify ransacking the future of Medicare, Medicaid, education, veterans, and working families. #HiddenRules$1.3 Trillion Tax Break for Corporations instead of simplifying the tax code or making it fairer, Repubs handed permanent tax breaks to big corporations, rewarded corporations shipping jobs overseas, and added even more loopholes for special interests to exploit. #HiddenRulesWhen 83 percent of the benefits from the #TrumpTax go to just the top 1 percent of earners, why is that specifically detrimental for communities of color? #HiddenRulesWe can not count on the @GOP to care about the economic interest of communities color. We must start the discussion on how to protect our communities. Join me now for this tweet chat on the #HiddenRules of race in the GOP tax law.Designed to enrich the wealthiest in the country, @realDonaldTrump's tax plan disproportionately harms communities of color. Join this important conversation now to learn more about the #HiddenRules of race in the GOP tax law.Raises Taxes on 86 Million Middle Class Families – the GOP tax scam’s meager, temporary benefits for the middle class evaporate in a few years, and the scam ultimately raises taxes on 86 million middle class families. #HiddenRules@desusandmero greetings gentlemen - I’m looking for that invite to be on your show. Looking forward to coming on the show and Let’s talk about bringing the show on the road to the Virgin Islands. #VIStrong@VelshiRuhle He petitioned for freedom of the press, organized the islands' first trade union. Following the transfer of the territory to American control in 1917, he lobbied for US citizenship for the islanders. (Cont)@VelshiRuhle David Hamilton Jackson (September 28, 1884 – May 30, 1946) was a labor rights advocate in the Danish West Indies, later the United States Virgin Islands. Jackson was an important figure in the struggle for increased civil rights and workers' rights on the islands.TODAY: The House will consider and debate the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act of 2018. #WRDA authorizes @USACEHQ to carry out projects to preserve our Nation’s water resources infrastructure.@desusandmero I have been trying to contact you all about being a guest on your show. I think it would be mad interesting to have a Member of Congress representing the Virgin Islands who was born in Brooklyn? How about it. Contact my office and let's make it happenCelebrating the resiliency of USVI farmers and ag culture today at the St. Croix Agriculture and Food Fair #ReboundRebuildRegrow https://t.co/ynSrfiEku3Nothing like a warm Crucian Welcome.

Who better to speak about our child welfare system than those who grew up in it? #FosterYouthVoices•#FosterYouthVoices must be included in the child welfare reform discussion. Looking forward to hosting Cordelia Cranshaw at #FosterYouthShadowDay 2018.In 2 days, foster youth from across the country will be meeting with Members of Congress to help our government improve the child welfare system. Looking forward to being part of this important conversation. #FosterYouthVoices.We must raise #FosterYouthVoices. Thank you to the @RepKarenBass and the @NFYInstitute for turning the attention of Congress to some of our young people who need it most.Who better to speak about our child welfare system than those who grew up in it? Proud to be participating in #FosterYouthShadowDay this Wednesday to raise #FosterYouthVoices.Proud of my colleagues for stopping the #GOPFarmBill, which just failed in the House 198 to 213. I hope the #GOP will now work with us on a bipartisan Farm bill that protects America’s working families and children. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAPThoughts and prayers go out to all affected by the recent shooting at a Santa Fe High School near Houston, Texas. Gun Violence in America especially in our schools must stop!A hungry child cannot concentrate, cannot focus, cannot learn. Roughly 265,000 low-income kids will lose access to meals at school because of partisan #GOPFarmBill. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAPAn estimated 2 million hungry Americans will be forced off SNAP by changes in the #GOPFarmBill.400,000 households will lose SNAP benefits under the #GOPFarmBill. Shame on the Republicans.Cuts to #SNAP would be devastating to low income families and many rural groceries and farmers markets. “Faith apart from works is dead.” (James 2:26) The #GOPFarmBill doesn’t do the work. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAP265,000 kids will lose access to free school meals under the #GOPFarmBill.House Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn’t cut #SNAP. That’s not true. H.R. 2 cuts $9.2 billion in benefits to create unproven state workforce bureaucracies.•#GOPFarmBill cruelly removes hundreds of thousands from #SNAP &amp; forces millions more to struggle to put food on the table. What happened to “Love thy neighbor?” #NoHouseFarmBill #HandsOffSNAPYou should read House DPCC Co-Chairs’ piece on CNN website about Democrats’ new plan for #ABetterDeal https://t.co/Z5Kgw0TpUJ#ABetterDeal means finally taking aim at outrageous prescription drug prices. https://t.co/bX0IlWH2feHappy birthday to the #VirginIslands own Tim Duncan https://t.co/lb8SbAD2rJThank you to @TMobile for Pledging to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses in the next five yearsReceiving a $1.6 Billion HUD Grant with @GovernorMapp and @HUDgov to help with the rebuilding efforts. https://t.co/4iuuiedeiqMoms earn 70 cents of what dads do each year. That means they have to work past Mother's Day to earn what dads earned last year.  #equalpaydayOver a 40-year career, the avg woman loses $418K to the #WageGap. But many groups of women lose so much more than that. We need #EqualPay now! #EqualPayDay #TalkPayNothing could be more important than ensuring that all workers receive equal pay for equal work. It's time for #EqualPay.https://t.co/f2JqQototRHappy 85th birthday Ruth Bader Ginsburg. You have been relentless in the fight for women's equality. We are all wishing you good health and many more years of service as a Justice on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/ZTWe8MkzoRToday students across my district are taking a stand to demand action on gun violence. I join them in solidarity, walking out for 17 minutes to honor the 17 killed one month ago in Parkland. #EnoughIsEnoughProud to stand with America’s students. Your voice is making a difference in the fight for action to prevent gun violence. We stand with you in saying #EnoughIsEnough to gun violence.Proud of all the students in the USVI and across the country taking a stand today.

Testing locations here → https://t.co/W63RcxUNdNMy thoughts and prayers are with my colleagues, their families, and staff after the accident in Virginia.@POTUS being with The USVI in the wake of these devastating storms is to acknowledge climate change as a threat and take meaningful action.#CHIP funding expired over 100 days ago, putting NINE million children's health care at risk – all because @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans wanted to use it as a bargaining chip. #AYearofTrumpReflecting on #AYearofTrump reminds me of the relentless attempts by Republicans and @POTUS to sabotage the #ACA &amp; take away health care from Americans. As a result, 3.2 million people have lost health insurance in 2017!Democrats have been working hard for months to keep a #TrumpShutdown to happen. There’s still time – GOP leaders should work with us!Immigrants who come as family are workers, entrepreneurs, caregivers, teachers, and neighbors. #ValueOurFamilies #NoFamilyBan@HouseGOP, it’s time for you to #DoYourJob and keep the government open &amp; working for the American people.Democrats have been working for months to keep government open &amp; we’ll keep fighting to make it a realityImmigrants are who make this country great. Our democratic principles are what make this country great. And fortunately for us, their resilience, and willingness to partake in the American experience are far more potent than your ignorance and bigotry.@POTUS Immigrants are who make this country great.
