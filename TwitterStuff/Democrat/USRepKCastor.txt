#FamiliesBelongTogether 

👉 https://t.co/ST8ukWbSdQ“The Trump Administration just can’t stop sabotaging Americans’ health care...[and] undermine the law in ways that would reduce access and raise rates.” Rick Scott &amp; Bondi should NOT be suing to end vital protection for pre-existing conditions for 7.8M Floridians! #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/cDiqYggo4oAnother day, another Pruitt bombshell! You’re right @RepHuffman, it’s time to #BootPruitt. This amount of toxic corruption cannot be allowed to continue to  stand - even in the Trump Administration. https://t.co/Ny8QTJy0r9I joked yesterday, but with 11 hours left in the day WHO KNOWS what else will come out about Pruitt. https://t.co/7j4sMk8mtFPruitt doesn't seem to hesitate to leverage his job at the @EPA into favors - as we've seen - including getting sold-out Rose Bowl tickets at a discount! https://t.co/qM01r79mcmTold you there'd be more! There's no way @SpeakerRyan can ignore the @nytimes report that EPA staffers felt pressured by Pruitt to help w/personal matters &amp; get special favors for his family. #shocker https://t.co/H44behrqcr@UMCMSuncoast @LutheranServFla @HispanicSvc @CCharitiesDOSP @TheSpringTB @GulfCoastJFCS @CrisisCenterTB @BALSTampaUnder current law, it's right &amp; legal for individuals fleeing persecution &amp; violence to request asylum in the U.S. Until recently, children of asylum seekers weren't separated from their parents. But under Trump’s new policy, they are. Frankly, this policy looks like child abuse. https://t.co/Tz6U19c5B4You are right @RepMcEachin and it is costing families and businesses a lot https://t.co/bFBnSHTccYIt’s only 3pm @SpeakerRyan, so Pruitt’s got time for at least 4 more scandals today… #BootPruitt #TrumpsToxicTeamI wonder if while his staff was going out to get the used bed if they picked up the Ritz-Carlton moisturizing lotion he asked for also. At least it’d be fuel efficient. 🤔Now he’s using his staff to get used beds and wasting money on custom made pens. Yep, $1,560 of taxpayer $ for 12 pens! GOP seems OK with this. https://t.co/zmcM7WDW1BRemember how former Rep. Schock (R) redecorated his office to look like Downton Abbey? Pruitt’s taken that to a whole other level. https://t.co/LhkLrvY8cHPruitt also seems to want to #MakeAmericaSickAgain by delaying, weakening, even reversing Obama-era chemical safety precautions! @EnergyCommerceHe abused his position to try get his wife with a fast food franchise. He settled for using his aides to get her a cushy legal job.Pruitt has a penchant for reassigning staffers who don’t agree with his frivolous spending. https://t.co/wowHRkYSoxI know this is a lot – believe me, I know – but stay with me….there’s more 😱 @RepHuffman @repblumenauer @RepMcEachin you may want to help @SpeakerRyan hereAnd who needs experts on science boards when you’re besties with the industries you’re supposed to regulate? https://t.co/1YQli1z1M5Pruitt urged withdraw from #ParisAgreement and refuses to #ActOnClimate – I thought the EPA was supposed to protect the environment? What’s the opposite of Captain Planet? https://t.co/S4cQnbm9R0Since you guys love talking about emails so much, don’t forget those two email addresses that Pruitt didn’t disclose. https://t.co/EJiVwhy0eKAnd @SpeakerRyan, my House resolution suggesting Pruitt resign has over 140 cosponsors. You should know about that too! #BootPruitt @EnergyCommerce#PollutingPruitt is harming our air, water &amp; health while his political donors doing very well. GOP seems ok with this #CoughCoughRemember those cronies Pruitt brought from Oklahoma and then gave exorbitant raises to? https://t.co/3ZLVFtkBZzPruitt also enjoys the perks of first-class travel at taxpayer expense… https://t.co/RIVBgD7HLlDon’t forget about his trip to Disneyland with an entourage of at least 20 people for his “security.” I’m sure they appreciated that trip. https://t.co/fOlxHgymRqThen we learned that Pruitt was renting DC condo owned by an energy lobbyist with dealings at the EPA - for $50 a night. What does $50 a night in DC usually get you? 👇 https://t.co/tNkM2cdmf7First, there’s the $43,000 soundproof phone booth Pruitt had installed in his office – which btw violates federal spending laws. Maybe @EPAScottPruitt is trying to hide something? https://t.co/fUbuoWS60kMaybe it’s time we got @SpeakerRyan up to speed then, shall we? (THREAD) https://t.co/C0ucJ96NNRFlorida’s Democratic congressional delegation called on Gov.
