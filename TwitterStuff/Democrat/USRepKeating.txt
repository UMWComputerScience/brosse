One of the greatest joys of my life has been being a dad to two great children. To all the fathers, grandfathers, uncles, and father-like figures, Happy Father's Day.We see the pictures of terrified children separated from their families on newspapers across the country.
 
This is not who we are - but if we don’t join together to stand up against this cruelty, it is exactly who we will become.I’m grateful to these four statesmen who were able to look beyond President Trump’s ridiculous trade war to help the thousands of Massachusetts families who depend on the local cranberry industry. https://t.co/Tq3K4djr0WI was happy to come to common agreement with President Macron, EU Ambassador O’Sullivan, German Ambassador Wittig, and French Ambassador Araud over the proposed retaliatory tariffs on cranberries. https://t.co/tCsYTY9vFHIncredibly moving moment at Marshfield High School's graduation ceremony this weekend. God bless our service men and women and their families that wait for them at home. https://t.co/ZyaSWXHXFRToday is an opportunity for quiet reflection to remember the service men and women who gave all and are buried at home and around the world, and a chance to offer gratitude for the sacrifices made for our nation by their mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons. https://t.co/yqqFe9inZfMy grandmother was a Gold Star mother, and I have always been committed to the ideal that our best opportunity to honor the memory of the fallen is by supporting the families left behind.On Memorial Day we honor the members of the United States Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We must never forget that we owe our freedom to these brave women and men who served and gave all in defense of our nation.Once again, we must ask: When will Speaker Ryan allow this Congress to do something to protect our kids and citizens so we can come together and say never again?Once again, I continue to pledge my commitment to common-sense gun safety laws.Once again, my prayers are with the victims, their families, and all those affected today in Santa Fe at yet another school shooting.The Senate just voted to reinstate #NetNeutrality rules. As a cosponsor of the House version of this bill, I am urging Speaker Ryan to bring it to the floor for a vote.Proud to stand in solidarity with the men and women of IBEW 1499 at the Philips plant in Fall River. #UnionStrong https://t.co/tFcOM01L1pThis morning I joined @SenWarren, @SenMarkey, @JonMitchellNB and members of the New Bedford fishing community to discuss offshore wind and the Sector IX closure. https://t.co/ZYi0iiVMidMy statement on POTUS's #IranDeal Announcement: https://t.co/82IBOhLYYHMy condolences to Lana's family, friends, and her @WBZnewsradio and @WBZ family, who are already having an incredibly tough month with the losses of Tony Pepper, Charlie Austin, and Gil Santos.Lana Jones knew everyone, and everyone who knew Lana knew her to be smart, kind, thorough, and great at her job. I had the pleasure of being interviewed by her many times over the years and I can say with certainty that Boston has lost one of its best reporters.For a man born and married on Patriots Day, Gil Santos was the consummate New Englander. He will be sorely missed.There are plenty of New Englanders who muted the TV broadcasts in big games and high leverage moments in favor of his calls with partner Gino Cappelletti. From the Snow Bowl to Super Bowl XXXVI to his final call in January of 2012, his voice is etched into our collective memory.For thirty-six years, Fairhaven native Gil Santos was the voice of the New England Patriots. The model of reliability - missing only one game in his years with the Pats - Santos narrated many of the Patriots moments we hold dearest. https://t.co/iNLsfBhuYDLike our own Abigail Adams, Barbara Bush will not simply be remembered as the wife and mother of Presidents, but also as a strong woman in her own right, wholly dedicated to her family and country.I firmly believe that there is no greater love than giving up one’s life for another. We are honored and humbled to have been served by Officer Gannon, a hero who sacrificed his life in the protection of our community.Our most heartfelt prayers go out to Officer Sean Gannon’s wife Dara, his family, and the men and women who served at his side.Medal of Honor recipient, and Fall River native, Capt. Thomas Hudner was laid to rest today in Arlington National Cemetery. A remarkable man - not many people get a Naval Destroyer named after them - he set a standard for heroics few can rise to. Rest in Peace Capt. Hudner.Like many who came of age in the 60's, I still remember where I was when we learned of Dr. King's assassination. In the 50 years since, his work continues, as we strive “to make America what it ought to be.” We continue his fight because this country is worth the trouble. #MLK50President Trump is taking us backwards.And Massachusetts has been a leader in treatment and prevention nationwide. While interdiction and law enforcement have a place, the narrow approach that dominated the President’s remarks today simply won’t work.That is why the Centers for Disease Control advocates for an approach of combining medically assisted and behavioral health treatment as the best course.Back then, I was tasked with the responsibility of approaching it from a criminal side, but I learned this is much more a public health issue.Over a decade and a half ago as Norfolk County District Attorney, I started an Opioid Task Force, and what I learned from my experience is that the President has it all wrong.Tevis &amp; I are saddened to hear of Rep. Louise Slaughter's passing. Tevis &amp; Louise shared Kentucky roots &amp; Louise was a great combination of Kentucky grit &amp; New York tenacity. Her enormous enthusiasm &amp; passion for her job never wavered. Our condolences to her family &amp; staff.When asked about the State Dept. last year, Trump said he is “the only one that matters" on foreign policy. As long as he believes that, the country is ill-served regardless of who is Secretary of State.It's outrageous that my Republican colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee stand completely at odds with our nation's top intelligence agencies who concluded Russia attacked our election system to help Donald Trump. Partisanship has trumped patriotism.Nantucket residents have shown they refuse to be indifferent. I join with everyone in this community in saying there is no place on this island – or anywhere – for hatred and racism.This response reminds me of the words of Elie Wiesel: the opposite of love isn’t hate, it’s indifference.I spoke with Charity Grace Lambert, director of Nantucket’s African Meeting House, who told me of the outpouring of support she’s received from so many on the island.Good luck to Mike Trapp from Marstons Mills who will be competing tonight (Saturday morning, South Korean time) in the Giant Parallel Slalom.  We’re with you, Mike! #winterolympics #snowboarding #bestofusThere are no more questions; no witch hunt. It happened. Russia interfered in our last election. And they are still doing it. Time for some of my colleagues to stop denying and start protecting our country.This is not who we are. This must end.Our nation owes a debt to these families and to all of those who suffered from preventable mass shootings. The sooner we satisfy that debt, the sooner we will help to ensure that tragedies of this scale never happen again.My heart goes out to the families of the Marjory Stoneham Douglas High School and all of South Florida. The tragedy laid upon them today will undoubtedly redefine their lives forever.Let's go Pats! #NotDoneYet #BlitzforSixWray was appointed by Trump, as was Rosenstein and Boyd – all of whom opposed releasing this memo. If there is a conspiracy against Republicans and this Administration, as President Trump wants everyone to believe, then it is being led by his own appointees.Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation into the Russian attack on our country, including possible involvement by the Trump Campaign, must continue unimpeded.Having read both Nunes and Democrats’ memo, the only reason to release the Nunes memo is to undermine the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and/or to attempt to justify firing him or other Department of Justice officials.Congratulations to my friend @RepJoeKennedy and to a great crowd in Fall River on a forward looking speech with a positive vision for our country's future. #SOTUResponseOur national security was weakened tonight as a result of the action of the Republican members of the the House Intelligence Committee.Please join me in keeping the safety and security of the roughly 15,000 American women and men serving in Afghanistan in your thoughts and prayers. Yesterday’s bombing in Kabul that killed 85 when an ambulance exploded is a tragic reminder of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.Coming from a family of public servants, it is not surprising that Cecile Richards has spent her life helping others and fighting to protect their rights. She is a true champion for women’s empowerment and her legacy - at Planned Parenthood and beyond - will last for generations.Congress has a constitutional responsibility to hold the Executive Branch accountable, and tonight’s @nytimes report is one of the most important developments yet to support an independent investigation. It’s time for my GOP colleagues to stop undermining this investigation.President Trump and the Republican Congressional leadership are orchestrating this shutdown to avoid dealing with issues that are critical to our country, including funding healthcare for more than 9 million children and protecting Dreamers...https://t.co/if74HJ1jcZProud to stand with Pastor Aguy and Cape Haitian-Americans at Canaan Bilingual SDA Church in Hyannis this AM. Discrimination against anyone is discrimination against everyone, and it is vital that we make sure our neighbors know we stand with them  in light of POTUS comments. https://t.co/Y6AtAt94ogTrump's disparaging comments about other nations during the DACA negotiations are beneath the office of the Presidency. They don't reflect the values and opinions of Americans, and he should apologize immediately.On #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay we recognize hard working men and women, like my father, brother and niece, who protect us every day. I have been honored to work with many great local and federal law enforcement officers as D.A. and in Congress - Thanks for all you do.Wishing a Happy &amp; Peaceful New Year to all as I look forward to continuing our work together in 2018.POTUS's decision to fire remaining members of the HIV/AIDS council sends a concerning message. We should be advancing the fight to eradicate this disease. The US is becoming a backseat player on some of our world's most challenging issues.  
https://t.co/V4tKLceV0RIn an America that values fairness, this fails. #RepublicanTaxBillOur thoughts and prayers are with the families of the two fishermen whose bodies were recovered today off of Nantucket.Praying for everyone affected by the horrific train derailment in Washington State and all the first responders working to save and treat victims.The FCC voted to repeal #netneutrality rules - a clear attack on consumer protections. Quick, affordable access to the internet that is free &amp; open is essential. Shame on our Admin. officials who are clearly doing the bidding of big business as opposed to putting citizens first.I am struggling to find the right words on this 5 year anniversary of Sandy Hook. Those children should be enjoying their first year of middle school. My heart is still broken for the families. We owe it to them to have a good faith conversation about ending gun violence.The strength of our country - an informed, engaged people exercising our  democratic rights and values - on clear display last night in Alabama.  America wins. Let us continue.Good luck to @dolphinathletic @SachemStudents @MashpeeFootball at Gillette today! Let's bring those Super Bowl trophies back to #MA09!Designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism is a critical piece of what must be a comprehensive US strategy for addressing the Kim regime's destabilizing and dangerous agenda.My thoughts and prayers are with the Sailors onboard the transport flight that crashed off the coast of Japan today. Hoping for a quick resolution to the status of the three who remain missing at this hour, and a speedy recovery to all involved.This weekend, Afghan women ran in the Bamiyan Marathon...This month, I met with former First Lady Laura Bush &amp; Afghanistan’s First Lady Rula Ghani on programs to strengthen women’s freedom &amp; participation in that country...https://t.co/s3p670LzwuContinuing to commemorate the 242nd birthday of the US Marine Corps in Falmouth. https://t.co/dlLIGresTOMarking the 242nd Birthday of the US Marine Corps with an early celebration in the Capitol. https://t.co/hkClst50KTHeading home after last votes and had good company on the runway at TF Green when I landed.

"So let’s consider more apt and accurate names.

Like, say, the National Debt Expansion Plan. Or the Medicare Benefits Endangerment Package. Or perhaps even the Tax Hike for the Next Generation Act.
