Saddened to hear of the attack on journalists and staff at the @capgaznews.

We need a compassionate, reasonable option for Dreamers, asylum-seekers, and migrant families - not border walls and detention camps for toddlers. #ProtectDREAMers #KeepFamiliesTogetherWhen I talk about @theRealDonaldTrump and the GOP sabotaging the #ACA and jacking up insurance premiums for tens of millions of Americans, this is one example of what I’m talking about. #ProtectOurCare

I am proud to cosponsor the #EqualityAct which protects the equal rights of LGBTQ Americans. #EqualityForwardTech companies in Pittsburgh rely on the #FreeandOpenInternet every day. These companies will grow faster and create more good-paying jobs if we can #SaveNetNeutrality in the House. That’s why I support #NetNeutralityIt’s disappointing that, among these 172 signatures, there is not one Republican. #NetNeutrality helps all Americans - we all need access to the Internet.

Our children need to feel safe at school. We should be INCREASING – not cutting – school programs that help reduce gun violence. https://t.co/6nGg0mQn2WThe #GOPTaxScam busted the budget and increased the national debt in order to give big tax breaks to the rich. Now, House Republicans want to cut programs like Medicare and Medicaid to pay for it. #BrighterforBillionaires https://t.co/upSgXM2DygPA health insurance premiums are rising – and the number of people in PA without health insurance coverage is increasing dramatically – because @POTUS and Congressional Republicans have been sabotaging the #ACA relentlessly. #ProtectOurCare@POTUS and Congressional Republicans have sabotaged the #ACA left and right; Now they’re attacking #ACA’s protections for pre-existing conditions. We can’t allow insurance companies to charge 130 million sick Americans more for their health care. #ProtectOurCareI want to offer my condolences to the family and friends of Antwon Rose. The video of his shooting is extremely troubling and raises many questions. There must be a thorough, transparent investigation of this incident - and appropriate action must be taken when it’s completed.I am a cosponsor of H.R. 6135, the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, @SpeakerRyan, and I am ready to work for a compassionate solution that ends the terrible separation of families at the border. https://t.co/3uDSDVBK4OThe Trump Administration can deny responsibility for separating families and point fingers at others, but this is their cruel policy and they could stop the separation of parents and children TODAY. #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepFamiliesTogether@DHSgov estimates that over 2,300 children have been separated from their parents since May. This policy is cruel and ineffective, and it causes unnecessary trauma. We need the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. https://t.co/Vmj4RuCXnHRecently joined a number of other @EnergyCommerce Members on a letter to @repgregwalden and @michaelcburgess demanding a hearing on the wellbeing of children separated from their parents and held in the custody of @HHSgov. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/DhbFWnNl1W https://t.co/LKSVQxCKSRNeuroscience experts agree that the trauma and uncertainty of being separated from their parents has significant, lifelong consequences for the brain development of young children.

This sends the message that @POTUS has no interest in the US being a world leader - or a country committed to human rights at home and around the world. It is a sad day for the US.
https://t.co/pwS7jPtKEHI am an original cosponsor of H.R. 6135, the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, which is legislation to end family separation at the U.S. border. https://t.co/WUJfH5JPE6The Trump Administration’s policy of #separatingchildren from their undocumented immigrant parents is a heartless, shameful violation of our American values and human decency. #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepFamiliesTogether

Republicans want to take us back to when insurance companies could discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.To help Americans w #opioid addiction, @POTUS and Congressional GOP should stop trying to take health insurance coverage away from them (and millions of others) by
-repealing #ACA
-undermining protections for pre-existing conditions, and
-restricting eligibility for #Medicaid.I supported the legislation approved by the House today to address the opioid crisis, but it’s just a first step. We must still enact long-term solutions that help the 2 million Americans who are struggling with opioid addiction.Despite overwhelming public support for #NetNeutrality, the @FCC has moved ahead with its repeal. The best way to #SaveNetNeutrality is by supporting the House discharge petition. Has YOUR Representative signed it yet? https://t.co/N7VCNFtYBNThe @FCC took away a free and open Internet.

https://t.co/N7VCNFtYBNIn 2016, 1 in 5 deaths of young people resulted from opioid overdoses.

https://t.co/zR99mJWPknVoted against partisan, ideological farm bill.

https://t.co/QBCE57xypNThe #GOPFarmBill sets back animal protections at the state level, exposing more animals to abuse. #KingAmendment #AnimalWelfareCutting conservation programs and rolling back rules on pesticides weakens crucial public health and environmental protections.

Hunger doesn’t just cause suffering; it also hurts children’s ability to learn and reach their potential. #HandsOffSNAPThe #GOPFarmBill takes food assistance away from 400,000 food-insecure households.

https://t.co/1RbQfKhxigNow that the FCC has voted to kill Net Neutrality, putting the Internet as we know it at risk, I will be introducing legislation to overturn today’s order, restore Net Neutrality, and protect a free and open Internet. 
https://t.co/tUPzzddNJ8Today, I join over 1.5 million other Americans in making the Sandy Hook Promise to keep our kids safe. 
https://t.co/ZRndjlB8Io"The Federal Communications Commission's own chief technology officer expressed concern Wednesday about Republican Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to repeal the net neutrality rules, saying it could lead to practices that are 'not in the public interest.'" https://t.co/aFzuG7UHhpWorking to protect #OpenInternet and #SaveNetNeutrality. I just sent a letter signed by 118 Members of Congress to @FCC urging them NOT to vote to kill #NetNeutrality tomorrow. If @FCC DOES vote to kill #NetNeutrality I will introduce a bill to stop them.

https://t.co/NZhqmOrpkSBecause of the backlash from Americans across the country, the VA reversed its decision to cut funding to help homeless vets. The VA says it will be reviewing the decision, but we’d better stay vigilant to make sure our veterans are taken care of! 
https://t.co/ybGBTu8FoyI also want to recognize our runners-up in the @CongressionalAC this year, Macen Perkins, Shane O’Malley, Derek Wassel, and Logan Hickey from @hilltopspartan. Great work! #HouseofCode https://t.co/nwKbIFh02qCongratulations to our winners of the @CongressionalAC: Nick Zana, Fuad Youssef, Peter Wang, and Henry Friedlander from @shady_side! Thank you for sharing your ideas and skills! #HouseofCode https://t.co/tHhNTJXkqqOur homeless veterans need help, not empty promises. I am strongly opposed to @POTUS and the @DeptVetAffairs decision to cut funding for a critical program which houses and assists our nation’s homeless veterans.     https://t.co/x3tFTaWcg6Join me tomorrow on @Reddit r/politics at 3 p.m. where I’ll be doing an #AMA on #NetNeutrality and the @FCC ’s upcoming vote to repeal the current NN rules on December 14th. https://t.co/0Ugpnd83DLI’m about to speak about #NetNeutrality at @OTI. Watch it here:  https://t.co/vPEbfNMjHT@nytimes gets #NetNeutrality.
@AjitPaiFCC plans to let ISPs dictate how you use the Internet. https://t.co/zli6yjTp2VI'm looking forward to speaking about the need to #SaveNetNeutrality tomorrow. https://t.co/Uyj09Ppk6N“Middle-Class tax cut”?  "The forgotten men and women of our country” forgotten no longer? Not so much under the tax bill passed by the #GOP last night.
The Republican tax bill will explode income inequality in America
// Vox - AllUnbelievable! #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/J8WDiWn5JRI’ve been working for years to increase federal support for apprenticeship programs like the one just announced by @GovernorTomWolf . They’re essential for providing Americans with the training they’ll need for good-paying jobs in the future.
https://t.co/G7ccxhiAQ2The @GOP tax plan cuts taxes for corporations and investors, and it does so on the backs of working and middle-class families. Companies will increase dividends, not raise wages. I oppose this terrible plan – we need to help grow the economy for all! https://t.co/05nyBjEEoCI’m organizing a letter to @AjitPaiFCC from as many Members of Congress as I can get to sign it, urging the Commission not to vote to kill #NetNeutrality on December 14th.
https://t.co/he5TKHGXrKHappy to see that Reddit supports my letter urging the FCC to delay its vote on @AjitPaiFCC’s plan to kill #NetNeutrality.

There's contact info in this TR article. https://t.co/GxA42F3TcLCBO: no matter how you count it, Senate #GOP tax bill hurts Americans earning up to  $75,000 by 2027, while massively cutting taxes for the rich. #GOPTaxScam 
https://t.co/h8HHvA1e7MChristmas came early this year for ISPs: @AjitPaiFCC announced plans today to repeal the Open Internet Order and end #NetNeutrality. This will be a devastating blow to consumers, innovation, and competition in this country.

https://t.co/MwuX9wL5g0I voted against this back-loaded attack on the Middle Class, and I will continue to fight for tax reform that benefits the hard-working Americans who need help the most. https://t.co/lKtZsJ5KAkGOP Tax bill cuts taxes for corporations &amp; wealthy, raises taxes for millions of others. Improving our economy – boosting jobs, wages, and opportunity – requires putting money back in the pockets of ALL Americans. That’s how we move the economy forward. https://t.co/FdiHlvQwNtI oppose HR 1, the GOP tax bill that its supporters claim will create big tax cuts for the Middle Class. It actually raises taxes on millions and does very little for the rest…while targeting most of its tax cuts to corporations and the rich. #GOPTaxScam
https://t.co/jZdPihcYCd@NCPSSM opposes the passage of HR 1, the #GOP tax bill, because it will cut #Medicare, #Medicaid and #SocialSecurity. I oppose HR 1 for that reason, too – along with a lot of other reasons! It’s a terrible bill, and it won't hurt just older Americans....
https://t.co/agMknymacbToday’s not just another Saturday.  It’s Veterans Day. Find some way to show your appreciation to a veteran today. https://t.co/4UdcMO7SSC“Senate bill would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families ... disproportionately benefit high earners and corporations.” 
https://t.co/KMQ7BRcUR0Tax reform should help American families.
Taxing money that graduate students earn is another example of how the GOP plan cuts taxes for corporations&amp;wealthy, NOT MiddleClass. #GOPTaxScam 
Raising grad school cost will also hurt US global competitiveness.

https://t.co/eF55GP246n@realDonaldTrump and @GOP in Congress claim their tax cuts will create growth and jobs. History says they’re wrong.
https://t.co/bTqDvhOQokGOP budget leaves “millions of Americans…worse off” – tiny tax cuts (or tax increases), huge public service cuts.
https://t.co/SxlRRSXIcOGOP budget cuts billions from Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, other important programs to offset massive tax cuts for rich.
https://t.co/bm4lFRk1hG@GOP Congress is clueless. @RepDianeBlack : "what is 'rich'? Is $1 million rich? Is $10 million rich? Is $1 billion rich?"
Yes, Yes and YES! https://t.co/Bl1G1rYbeCApparently, #MAGA includes @POTUS increasing the number of Americans without health insurance. #ProtectOurCare
https://t.co/yEPHLrJS5F@SenateGOP passes budget to cut taxes for rich, explode national debt. Next, cut programs that help everyone else?
https://t.co/gx8fbOXtZ6@POTUS calls reimbursement for #ACA mandate a #bailout; here’s why he’s wrong: https://t.co/HTElgdXPtc@POTUS raises premiums for millions of Americans. #ACA wasn’t failing until @realDonaldTrump took a meat axe to it. https://t.co/Jb57sUSCfaHere’s a good summary of how @realDonaldTrump has been working hard to undermine the #ACA since inauguration day. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/cCtHAADArZPA Insurance Commissioner announced that 2018 #ACA health insurance premium increases are 4X bigger thanks to @POTUS
https://t.co/JzDmQD1dFzOnce again, @realDonaldTrump gambles with foreign policy against the advice of experts around the world &amp; in his cabinet #IranNuclearDeal https://t.co/zgnFn76WId@realDonaldTrump says Obamacare is failing, but he’s lying. Here's a list of all the ways he has undermined it: https://t.co/mBnnYmSDTu@POTUS wants looser rules on AHPs. It’s been tried before. Didn’t go well: financial instability, failure, and fraud https://t.co/HELBjuB5iz@realDonaldTrump EO threatens Americans with pre-existing conditions through changes in health insurance regs.
https://t.co/oGfw0pfI9Q@POTUS EO=return to bad old days: cheaper skimpier plans that don’t cover much, don’t pay much – but undermine #ACA.
https://t.co/QMcEhKugQO@POTUS EO likely to destabilize #ACA insurance markets: siphon off healthy; raise cost for sicker/older Americans.
https://t.co/oGfw0pfI9Q“President Trump took two giant steps Thursday to disembowel the Affordable Care Act.” @POTUS #ACA #ProtectOurCare

https://t.co/yut9NFxT8D@Google's supporting approach I’ve called for: ensuring Americans have the training/skills they need for future jobs
https://t.co/3OBAufNRJiDon't be fooled.@realDonaldTrump is still trying to undermine #Healthcare ; we will see instability &amp; higher costs. https://t.co/UGKNsIFReS@HMNorthey @ctraywick You folks do great work!@POTUS can disagree with press reporting, but shouldn’t threaten their licenses. @AjitPaiFCC must reject his threat to freedom of the press.First, @POTUS withdraws from the #ParisAgreement, now he reverses #CleanPowerPlan. I’ll continue fighting these short-sighted actions. (3/3)This is a huge step backwards that ignores scientific consensus. #ClimateChange requires action now - not years from now.
