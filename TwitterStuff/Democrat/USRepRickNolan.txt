That’s the right way to improve healthcare in America – not by the Trump administration’s backdoor regulatory attacks.GOP leadership has repeatedly tried to repeal the #ACA legislatively. Now, the Trump administration is now planning to sabotage Americans’ health care by taking steps to make it easier for insurers to sell flimsy, flight-by-night plans that exclude #PreexistingConditions. https://t.co/tla6Coe0ZPSo proud of the U.S. men's curling team -- led by Duluth's very own John Shuster!

You can read my full statement below. https://t.co/C2ef1u3P8lCongratulations to MN athletes in the #Olympics2018!
 
Special shoutout to our #MN08 athletes: Cory Christensen (Duluth), Aileen Geving (Duluth), Tyler George (Duluth), John Landsteiner (Duluth), Joe Polo (Duluth), John Shuster (Chisholm), Sidney Morin (UMD), Maddie Rooney (UMD). https://t.co/gDkDxPT5VWToday I joined my colleagues @RepSchneider (D-IL) and @RepHuizenga (R-MI) in urging the Appropriations Committee to help prevent the spread of Asian Carp into the #GreatLakes. 

We need to protect all of our precious waters from damaging #invasivespecies. https://t.co/2g0hvnYcgfI am proud to cosponsor the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act – a bill which will help drive down U.S. carbon emissions and put more money in the pockets of middle class Americans. https://t.co/dnn7BXYZ5HInstead of a #militaryparade, we should be using that money to raise military servicemembers' pay, create jobs for Veterans, and end Veteran homelessness.Just a few of the times my Democratic colleagues and I have called for CHC funding - https://t.co/Xeqag2LRExActually, some of us have wanted to fund community health centers all along. 

Unfortunately, Republican leadership has decided that CHCs are a useful bargaining chip in negotiations. That’s why GOP leadership hasn’t let us vote on a clean funding bill for them. https://t.co/UmoOvRKmAAAmericans who rely on Social Security deserve the peace of mind and security knowing their hard-earned benefits won’t suddenly disappear. #NoPrivatization #NoEntitlementReformWall Street is volatile, unpredictable, and far too risky to afford tying the retirement incomes of some 60 million #SocialSecurity recipients to its ups and downs. #NoPrivatization #NoEntitlementReformIf anyone needed reminding of why privatizing #SocialSecurity and turning it over to Wall Street is a terrible idea, look no further than the last couple days of stocks taking a nose dive. #NoPrivatization #NoEntitlementReform https://t.co/npq8YMTdVkHappy 25th anniversary to the Family and Medical Leave Act - a monumental victory for workers and families across the Nation.

Good news for democracy. https://t.co/tWbhMOxtQZYet again, our federal government is on the brink of a shutdown. This is unacceptable.

That’s why I introduced my “No Government – No Pay” legislation, which would force subsequent Congresses to work with no pay until a budget is passed.

https://t.co/ALzjS1yht1 https://t.co/IwESlCZCGbThat’s why I’ve introduced my “RESTORE DEMOCRACY” legislation. Our measure calls for establishing a system of public financing for campaigns – and overturning #CitizensUnited to stop the secret, dark money that is poisoning our elections and eroding public confidence in gov't.No doubt about it. It’s #CampaignFinance season. 

Here's what I think: When members of Congress go to Washington, they should go to work for the American people – not spend their time courting big donors for their re-election campaigns. https://t.co/bKP44dFxfi@FallonTonight Come on out for some ice fishing 🐟🐟🐟 and a shore lunch! It doesn’t get better than that. #MinnesotaThingsAnd tomorrow we continue to march. In the words of Dr. King Jr., “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” No matter where we live, or who we are, we all have a part to play in fighting injustice.  #IAM2018 11/11So today we take a moment of silence to honor the lives of Echol, Robert, and the brave workers, union leaders, activists, families and friends who ensured that these two men did not die in vain. #IAM2018 10/The strike finally ended on April 16th – with a settlement that included union recognition and wage increases. It was a huge victory for African-American activism, for unions, and for the brave workers who had risked everything. #IAM2018 9/Support poured in from AFSCME chapters across America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. traveled to Memphis to march in solidarity. It was Dr. King Jr.’s last march before he was assassinated. #IAM2018 8/ https://t.co/mJl7n0dWn2They marched in the streets, with signs bearing simple but powerful words: “I AM A MAN.” #IAM2018 7/ https://t.co/OF4ygo6uS0And for more than two months – risking everything – and facing racial discrimination and disrespect from all sides – thirteen hundred AFSCME Local 1733 workers continued to strike. #IAM2018 6/The other workers were devastated. But they were also filled with fury. They had worked for years without sufficient wages, equipment, or protections. They voted to strike. #IAM2018 5/That afternoon, while Echol and Robert were huddled in the truck, disaster struck. The truck’s compactor suddenly kicked on. The two men were crushed to death. #IAM2018 4/The sanitation workers had told their managers – many times – that some of their equipment was faulty. But managers did nothing. #IAM2018 3/It was February 1st, 1968 in Memphis. It was a Thursday. And it was pouring rain. Two sanitation workers, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, climbed into the back of their truck to take shelter from the storm. #IAM2018 2/Today is the 50th anniversary of the events leading to 1968 Memphis Sanitation Worker’s Strike – a historic day for workplace and civil rights.

In honor of that day, I’d like to tell a story.

#MinnesotaProud https://t.co/IxWK2paia3The truth is, Social Security and Medicare are benefits that Americans EARN and pay into from their first hour of their first day on the job.“We’re going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform.” – Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI)

@MineWorkers @TeamstersI’m calling on @SenateMajLdr, @SpeakerRyan, @SenSchumer&amp; @NancyPelosi to find an IMMEDIATE fix to the America’s pension crisis in today's budget meeting with @realDonaldTrump.

@FinGovernment https://t.co/33x9KeAGdoToday I joined my colleagues in calling for an end to #SchoolLunchShaming.

No child should ever have to go to the cafeteria and be publicly humiliated because they cannot afford their lunch.

Read the full letter below ↓ ↓ ↓ https://t.co/3DaCW1OTuNThis is absurd. Government by crisis management is no way to run a country.

That’s why I introduced my “No Government – No Pay” Act, which stops future Congresses from getting paid if the government shuts down. https://t.co/BsMSwpUt2BThis #GOPTaxBill reminds me of what Sen. Ted Kennedy said about a past Republican tax plan: 

"If you're a CEO, this plan hands you enough money for a Mercedes, but if you're a teacher, you only get enough to buy a hubcap."

➩adds $1 trillion to the debt
➩raises taxes on millions of middle class Americans
➩sets the stage for massive cuts to Medicare &amp; Soc Security

#GOPTaxScamHow is it that whenever the government needs money to help out billionaires, we somehow find it – but when it comes to Medicare, Social Security and human development, somehow there is no money to be found?

https://t.co/QlAfiEybWNToday, I joined @keithellison and my fellow Antitrust Caucus members in introducing the “Retrospective Mergers Act,” which would require FTC &amp; DOJ to conduct annual retrospective studies of how mergers impact prices, jobs, wages, and local economies. https://t.co/vBddUmIIASChildren need health insurance. We can't afford to wait on this. 

Minnesota, where #CHIP serves nearly 125,000 children, will be one of the first states to run out of funding.

https://t.co/SUhLmj8i82I vow to fight tooth and nail against any cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Not in this tax plan. Not ever. #GOPTaxScam 4/4Analyses have already shown that if the #GOPTaxScam goes through, Medicare alone could see cuts of $25 billion a year. 3/4Senator Marco Rubio is ON RECORD -- after giving huge tax break to the super-rich, Republicans will move to “instituting structural changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future."   #GOPTaxScam 2/4

https://t.co/VPLbzkrPisHere’s the cold hard fact: Republican leaders plan to pay for the #GOPTaxScam by cutting Social Security and Medicare. 1/4Republican leadership has abandoned all semblance of Regular Order. https://t.co/hF4f2ZTRaJCongratulations to Kim Sheley of Backus, who was chosen as this year’s Pine River-Backus Teacher of the Year!

The simple truth is, tax cuts don’t pay for themselves, and trickle-down economics has never worked.

Your training programs allow students and veterans to secure good paying jobs – and our state of Minnesota to succeed economically! https://t.co/oqQm2HPp37There’s no question: #NetNeutrality must be protected.

It should not be up to a few enormous corporations to control content or speed on the internet. 

https://t.co/XNLyByYkB13. This bill is a GOOD DEAL all around:

➞ Helps create good paying jobs on the Iron Range.

➞ Opens up 2,000 acres of wetlands, lakeshore, and wild rice waters to the public.

➞ Expedites a land exchange already approved by Obama Administration's Forest Service.2.  This bill does NOT APPROVE any mining project. Any proposed project must still go through the rigorous, science-based state &amp; federal approval process.But I want to make a few things clear.

1. It does NOT involve the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in any way. I love the Boundary Waters - in fact, I was one of the ORIGINAL COSPONSORS of the legislation that established the BWCA as a protected area.Last night, the House passed (with overwhelming bipartisan support) my bill, H.R. 3115, in a big win for the Iron Range! https://t.co/vdKaeHamazIt's time for Congress to take responsibility and address gerrymandering across the board.

That’s why I introduced my “RESTORE DEMOCRACY” legislation, which calls for an end the political gerrymandering of Congressional districts.

https://t.co/iUHr3MExJBThe deadline to prevent a federal government shutdown is 10 DAYS away.

BOTTOM LINE: If Congress can’t do its job, Congress shouldn’t get paid. 

That's why I introduced by #NoGovernmentNoPay bill (H.R.1789 ).

➙ flight cancellations or delays
➙ involuntary bumping
➙ lost or damaged baggage
➙ disabilities or injuriesToday I introduced a bill that requires U.S. airlines to provide passengers with a simple, one-page “BILL OF RIGHTS.” ✈

https://t.co/GlS4SgjqmkToday, I voted no on the #GOPTaxScam.

This bill 1) raises taxes on millions of middle class families, 2) gives enormous tax breaks to the super-rich and corporations, and 3) sets the stage for cuts to Social Security and Medicare. https://t.co/nKXg6gFRcWWonderful to meet @CloseUp_DC students and teachers from Deer River High school today!

@CarltonCountyMN @cloquetlibraryWhen you give trillion-dollar tax breaks to the super-rich, the money's got to come from somewhere.

That "somewhere" is almost certainly #Medicare and #SocialSecurity. 

Thank you to National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare for speaking out. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/5eDwIxfY53We should not be forcing retirees, the underinsured, or the middle class to pay for tax breaks for the super-rich and big corporations.

#YemenDebate

Watch below! https://t.co/JUISTb6hG6America's support for this Saudi-led war in Yemen is: 

1. Unauthorized by Congress,
2. Contributing to horrific starvation, disease, and death in Yemen.
3. Another endless war of choice that the American citizens have to pay for.

#YemenDebateThat's why I introduced my amendment (which House passed last July) declaring that no NDAA funds will be used to deploy ground troops in Yemen.As I said just now on the House floor - America has no business for involving itself in this Saudi-led war in Yemen.

#YemenDebateI was honored to award WWII Veteran Leo Raymond Hiveley of Cook his recovered medals after his honorable discharge from the Navy in 1945.
 
To Mr. Hiveley and his family – thank you for your service and your sacrifice.

https://t.co/XYiQEgq4lVThe simple truth is, the #GOPTaxScam would have devastating consequences for higher education, and it could pave the way for major brain drain out of the United States.

https://t.co/v0hb86Uysv https://t.co/mj3MTwL2MxThis morning, I spoke on the House floor about the #GOPTaxScam. 

This bill gives a huge tax break to the ultra-rich and corporations, raises taxes on millions of middle class families, and passes the debt on to future generations.
