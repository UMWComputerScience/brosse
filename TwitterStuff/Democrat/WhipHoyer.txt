Today marks 10 years since the signing of the Post-9/11 G.I. bill. I was proud to bring this bill to the Floor as Majority Leader &amp; will continue to stand up for those who don the uniform of our nation &amp; risk their lives to protect our democracy. https://t.co/64muNkrJTtFollowing the tour of @wrtpbigstep, @RepBarbaraLee, @RepGwenMoore, and I sat down with stakeholders to hear about the day-to-day barriers families in Milwaukee face &amp; how Congress can help. #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour https://t.co/BwxTCea1bLWhile visiting @wrtpbigstep on the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour, we joined students and staff to discuss how the program is helping students gain the skills they need for good-paying jobs &amp; the importance of federal funding for these job training programs. https://t.co/xZsXlZOmvxThe Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour stopped by @wrtpbigstep, which provides skills training &amp; works with employers to ensure that individuals gain the skills that local employers need. We visited with students who are learning blueprint, math, and other essential skills. https://t.co/G413SlUNZvUpdate: @RepLujanGrisham, @HispanicCaucus, &amp; myself still haven't received answers from @TheJusticeDept @HHSGov &amp; @DHSGov on any of the critical questions we asked on the status of separated children in their custody. Our statement: https://t.co/7fphdVvPlC #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/HgD0XqInXtThat’s about 3.7% of the 162 million person US workforce. What about the other 96.3% - the other 156 million workers? #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/B9inNXsOs3Is this a dog ate my @USCBO report situation? https://t.co/ewQAGoLxQPAs part of our Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour, we joined parents at Next Door Educare to discuss how housing early childhood education &amp; comprehensive services at one-site can help ensure parents have the services necessary to support learning. https://t.co/BM3Y6tiGjUAt Next Door Educare, I had the opportunity to join the Read With Me reading program for toddlers and kids. Investments in early childhood education are critical to ensuring children &amp; their families can succeed. #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour https://t.co/IKPKjP94b3I'm in Milwaukee, WI kicking off the next leg of the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour with @RepBarbaraLee &amp; @RepGwenMoore. We're visiting Next Door Educare, a state-of-the-art school that provides comprehensive services to children &amp; their families. https://t.co/5iu7SZdQ9EWishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @HouseAgDems, Rep. Collin Peterson.A free press is one of our nation’s founding principles, &amp; this unconscionable attack is extremely troubling. I stand with the @CapGazNews as they grieve the loss of their colleagues and friends.The talented men and women of @CapGazNews newsroom are dedicated to telling the stories of their community. The fact that they worked through their grief to put out today’s paper is a testament to that dedication.Rebecca was a kind and thoughtful person and a friend to many.Gerald was a dedicated editor and excellent writer, with a knack for the issues most important to the people of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County.Wendi was a prolific and hardworking reporter. She was well known in her community for her reporting, volunteer work, and role as a ‘proud Navy mom.’John was a talented reporter and editor who I was fortunate to work with in his coverage of Bowie and local politics. His coverage was always fair, and I appreciated his diligence and commitment to his profession.Rob was an outstanding editor who cared deeply about his staff and mentoring reporters. I enjoyed our many conversations over the years and valued his insight.My heart breaks for @CapGazNews today. My prayers are with the families, friends, &amp; colleagues of Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Wendi Winters, Gerald Fischman, &amp; Rebecca Smith as they grieve for their loved ones.

My thoughts and prayers remain with the victims, their loved ones, and the entire #CapitalGazette family during this difficult time.I was heartbroken to learn of the shooting this afternoon in Annapolis. I have known the hardworking staff of the @CapGazNews for many years, &amp; I extend my deepest condolences to the dedicated editors, reporters, &amp; staff. https://t.co/C5oBQHEnOKMonitoring reports of a shooting at @CapGazNews in Annapolis. My thoughts and prayers are with the staff, first responders, &amp; others on the scene. Thank you @AACOPD for your immediate response.Today, Dems &amp; GOP came together to fund our military for FY19, a sign of our common commitment to strong defense. While there are provisions in this bill that could be made better, overall it represents a bipartisan compromise &amp; adheres to budget caps.  https://t.co/rEnVs5um6t.@HouseGOP, are you listening? 
 
Democrats are speaking out on behalf of children separated from their parents &amp; for the DREAMers left in limbo by your inaction.
 
It’s time to work together on bipartisan solutions to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; #KeepFamiliesTogether. RT if you agree. https://t.co/y0n2kxw1X7.@POTUS may think he can play good cop, but backslapping &amp; smiles will not change Putin’s behavior or stop Russia’s aggression or its nefarious efforts to undermine American democracy. I urge him to take a tough approach &amp; to do so in concert with our NATO allies.If @POTUS does meet with Putin, he must address Russia’s human rights shortcomings, their interference in our elections, &amp; destabilizing activities in Eastern Ukraine &amp; Syria. For President Trump to ignore these issues would be an abdication of his responsibilities.That @realDonaldTrump is set to meet with Russian President Putin in Helsinki next month makes a mockery of history. It was in Helsinki in 1975 that 35 nations, including the Soviet Union, agreed to respect human rights &amp; basic freedoms of their people. https://t.co/w3DyGcKGGRAmericans see through the GOP’s misleading rhetoric &amp; they aren’t buying the trickle-down arguments. Dems will continue to highlight the broken promises of this #GOPTaxScam &amp; its damaging effects on our economy and on the American people.When Republicans passed their #GOPTaxScam, they promised that for $1.8 trillion added to the debt, we would see unprecedented growth of 4%,5% or 6%---today’s BEA report shows GDP growth fell to just 2% in the first quarter. https://t.co/XAgoA0YgktThis vote puts @HouseGOP on record when it comes to the question of whether law enforcement agencies in our country ought to be able to perform their jobs independently and free from the taint of politics.Today’s resolution, while unenforceable, is wholly inappropriate and a blatant attempt to undermine the Special Counsel’s investigation. It is essential that Congress not meddle in an ongoing criminal investigation. https://t.co/i06h6SfqC3Today on the Floor, House Dems are voting against another partisan attempt by @HouseGOP to undermine Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. The House is also voting on passage of the Fiscal Year 2019 funding bill for @DeptofDefense. https://t.co/iI8CvMe8QHWhen submitting a photo, please include your name and where your photo was taken.

@SenateMajLdr said it was inappropriate to act on a SCOTUS nomination in an election year. Ahead of the election, he should abide by his own delayed process. https://t.co/FQXPa3xqTWCongrats to Fatemeh Hosseini for winning the #MD05 Congressional Art Competition. Her artwork will be on display in the U.S. Capitol for the next year. I was so impressed with all of the submissions and join in thanking the many students who competed. https://t.co/sSR2AQcr14 https://t.co/deZLIDQGvoThursday is the anniversary of #SCOTUS upholding the #ACA— a reminder that GOP is driving up the cost of health care &amp; undermining protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Dems will continue to hold them accountable for their attempts to undermine the law.On reports that @HouseGOP may offer a narrow measure that would result in family detention, I said to press if the alternative to separating families is to keep them together but in an inhumane context, it’s not an alternative. #FamiliesBelongTogetherI told press today the migrants @RealDonaldTrump speaks so despairingly about are people fleeing for their lives, their safety &amp; their welfare. They’re asking for asylum. To characterize these folks as less than humans worthy of empathy is un-American. #FamiliesBelongTogetherAt my weekly press conference I said Dems opposed the GOP’s anti-immigrant bill today because:
-it does not #ProtectDREAMers
-it does not solve the family separation crisis created by POTUS
-it wastes 25 billion taxpayer $ on an ineffective border wall.@RealDonaldTrump created these crises &amp; his actions are now making it harder for Congress to address them responsibly.  I urge POTUS to cease his unhelpful tweets &amp; call on @HouseGOP to work with Dems toward a workable, bipartisan solution to these challenges.Democrats envision immigration policies that are smart, responsible, &amp; humane. That’s why we continue to be ready to work across the aisle to keep asylum-seeking families together &amp; to solve the DACA crisis in a way that is fair &amp; provides a pathway to citizenship.Another partisan GOP immigration bill failed in the House. When will GOP leaders realize the path forward on immigration &amp; asylum reform must be a bipartisan one? When will they focus on policies recognizing the human aspect of our immigration challenges? https://t.co/u6xGoUAzuBDems will continue to fight for the rights of all workers – whether public or private sector – to organize &amp; bargain collectively for better pay &amp; benefits &amp; work environments.  I will keep working closely w organized labor to defend workers’ rights victories &amp; expand on them.The #Janus decision today overturns forty years of precedent &amp; will undermine the ability of law enforcement officers, firefighters, teachers, &amp; other public servants to do their jobs &amp; earn the pay &amp; benefits they deserve while working in safe workplaces. https://t.co/PnEXopkJnGAt today’s press conference, I was pleased to introduce my friend and fellow Marylander @OlaOjewumi who spoke passionately about how Republicans are raising health care costs &amp; undermining coverage. Warriors like Ola are why we continue to fight to #ProtectOurCare every day. https://t.co/GAr1OHQY0AToday, I joined House Dems &amp; Americans with pre-existing conditions to speak out against Republicans’ efforts to sabotage #ACA &amp; undermine protections for 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/sHWOjGatlx https://t.co/i92R6LPFOxI thank @RepJoeCrowley for serving as a tireless fighter for jobs, opportunity &amp; a better future for the people of our country, and I wish him well.

Today, let us celebrate the hard-won victories in the march for equality &amp; draw strength from them as we seek further progress. https://t.co/WWOuAnu58T #LoveWins #EqualityForward.@HouseGOP continues to stall when it comes to addressing our immigration &amp; asylum challenges.  Meanwhile, children remain separated from their parents with no plan for reunification, &amp; this GOP Congress’s fecklessness gives the Trump Admin a free hand to pursue extreme policies.I thank @RepAdamSmith &amp; @RepJayapal for introducing the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act &amp; join as a co-sponsor to ensure that migrant families are neither separated nor mistreated. #FamiliesBelongTogether  https://t.co/Rq3W9pMFmwIn effect, this ruling will make it harder for women to access the care they seek.  Setbacks like this one mean that we must not relent in the fight to ensure every woman’s right to make her own health care choices and have access to the full range of care options.Deeply disappointing that #NIFLAvBecerra decision will give unlicensed facilities a green light to mislead women about the health care services they provide.  No woman ought to be denied access to information about reproductive care options available. https://t.co/FBnRyZsb8xWe are calling on the Admin to appoint a federal official to serve as a point of contact to Members of Congress and provide daily status updates on these families and efforts to reunify them. Read the full letter here: https://t.co/9utPiKF81m #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pcSUw65zC5Joined @HispanicCaucus to demand answers from @TheJusticeDept, @HHSGov, &amp; @DHSGov on the status &amp; well-being of children separated from their parents at the border &amp; detained by the Trump Admin. We need to see a detailed plan for family reunification. https://t.co/zaBzTmXYugI believe #SCOTUS got it wrong. @POTUS’ #MuslimBan will weaken our nation by denying talented immigrant workers &amp; job creators &amp; limiting opportunity for foreign businesspeople to invest in America. It also makes us less safe. I urge POTUS to end the ban. https://t.co/9rUUWFmDmhToday on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider twenty bills. https://t.co/FhNkg4HFTUFive years after the Shelby County v.

I urge Republican leadership to bring legislation to the Floor to #RestoreTheVOTE &amp; ensure all Americans can exercise their most fundamental right. https://t.co/8ugJwrJpzRRepublicans promised workers they would see increased wages and benefits thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. Six months later, workers are seeing layoffs as a result of the law while wealthy shareholders reap the benefits. https://t.co/Vk8rhg7ZXhWishing a happy birthday to the Ranking Member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, @RepAdamSchiff.6 months since #GOPTaxScam became law, I joined Americans affected by it to discuss how the promises that the GOP made are not coming to fruition. Instead, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, small biz owners are facing mounting uncertainty. https://t.co/7QivABnfnS https://t.co/vq1AoCSN1QOn the six-month anniversary of the #GOPTaxScam, here’s a look at how the law is a giveaway to the wealthiest in America and corporations while leaving America’s small businesses, working families, &amp; older Americans behind. https://t.co/jH9Ait8DGIMany of the opioid bills the House passed this week are an important first step, but GOP hypocrisy on this issue has been on full display with their efforts to take coverage away from Americans suffering from opioid addiction. https://t.co/lqgpCxYDFjToday on the Floor, I called on @GOPLeader to put the bipartisan USA Act on the Floor for a vote. It’s time to let the People’s House work it’s will to #ProtectDREAMers and solve the crisis created by the Trump Administration’s family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/tTMUo0YUPRCongress has a responsibility to create a pathway to citizenship for #DREAMers &amp; ensure children are reunited w their families. That’s what Dems are committed to doing &amp; will continue to work toward, no matter how long the GOP kicks the can down the road. #FamiliesBelongTogetherLegislation on immigration is not, as @POTUS &amp; many of his allies in Congress believe, a waste of time.  Those who care about our nation’s #DREAMers, families fleeing violence, &amp; national security must come together without delay, no matter what POTUS is tweeting, to take action.For months @RealDonaldTrump has called on Congress to solve the #DACA crisis that he created &amp; days ago he called on Congress to solve the family separation crisis he created – but today he has decided that it’s a waste of time.  https://t.co/ehVtvA89WQThe President’s daughter &amp; Senior Advisor Ivanka Trump is donating funds to aid the migrant children separated from their parents because of her father’s policy. It would have been better if @RealDonaldTrump had not created the crisis in the first place. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMuneer Baig, Founder &amp; CEO of SYSUSA, joined Dems today to discuss how the #GOPTaxScam is a huge handout to large corporations while small businesses like his struggle with mounting uncertainty..@RepMcEachin knows firsthand the challenges of owning a small business. I thank him for joining us today to discuss how the #GOPTaxScam adds to the complexity and uncertainty small businesses face.Donna Cywinski’s son has a pre-existing condition and fears his premiums will skyrocket as a result of the #GOPTaxScam, which undermines the #ACA. Thanks to Donna for telling her story today. We’ll continue to hold the GOP accountable for increasing health care costs.I thank @CongressmanRuiz for joining me today to discuss the #GOPTaxScam &amp; its impact on health care costs. By undermining the #ACA, the tax law will mean skyrocketing health care costs &amp; loss of coverage for many Americans.Today, John Glaser is joining House Dems to discuss how the #GOPTaxScam is a bad deal for American families &amp; hurts seniors like him on Medicare. I agree with him that seniors should not have to live in fear of being unable to afford their health care.Thank you @JanSchakowsky for joining today’s press conference on the #GOPTaxScam &amp; discussing how the law undermines the sustainability of Medicare &amp; Social Security. We must protect these programs for current &amp; future generations.The more time passes &amp; Americans learn what’s in the #GOPTaxScam, the more unpopular it becomes. Dems will continue to hold the GOP accountable for their vote to raise taxes on the middle class, kick millions off health coverage, &amp; make the tax code more confusing for small biz.Today, we are joined by a small biz owner who will discuss how the #GOPTaxScam has created more uncertainty &amp; complexity for his company; a mom who is facing the prospect of skyrocketing health costs; &amp; a senior concerned by how the law undermines Medicare..@HouseGOP said all Americans would be better off under the #GOPTaxScam, but, six months later, we know that’s not true for many middle-class Americans.Republicans promised that companies would use their tax cuts from the #GOPTaxScam to hire more workers and raise wages, but many companies are laying off workers &amp; many more are using their tax cut to enrich investors through stock buybacks.Republicans promised that American workers would see a $4,000 raise thanks to the #GOPTaxScam, but wages are falling. They said that families struggling from paycheck to paycheck would see real relief, but rising health care &amp; gas costs are eating up more of their paychecks.Six months after the #GOPTaxScam, none of the promises that Republicans made are coming to fruition.The #GOPTaxScam will cause taxes to go up for 86 million middle-class households and give 83% of the tax cuts to the top 1% of Americans.Six months ago, Congressional Republicans passed a hastily written #GOPTaxScam law that adds $1.8 trillion to the deficit to give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest. The bill came to the Floor without hearings, testimony, &amp;, very frankly, without proofreading.My staff will tweet during today’s press conference on the #GOPTaxScam’s impact on middle-class families, small biz owners, &amp; seniors. Follow along here using the hashtag #GOPTaxScamOn the 6 month anniv of the #GOPTaxScam, I’m w @NancyPelosi, @JanSchakowsky, @CongressmanRuiz, @RepMcEachin &amp; Americans impacted to discuss how it is leaving small biz behind, raising health care costs, &amp; making retirement less secure. Tune in: https://t.co/MU2UYdnHRQQuick refresher:
1. You created this #DACA crisis &amp; asked Congress to “do your job” &amp; pass a bill.
2. Democrats have offered multiple bipartisan proposals to #ProtectDREAMers.
3. You’ve rejected every single one. You can’t take yes for an answer. https://t.co/HyrO9JXNSA.@realDonaldTrump’s plan to merge the Depts of Ed &amp; Labor is a thinly veiled attempt to cut essential programs – including workforce training, worker protections, student loans, &amp; civil rights protections. Read my statement with @RepBarbaraLee: https://t.co/jGtneB427vI joined @genprogress today outside the White House to tell @realDonaldTrump to #KeepFamiliesTogether and end this merciless and cruel family separation policy implemented by his Administration. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/5DZy17ASlA.@POTUS’s family separation policy will have a devastating long-term impact on thousands of children.

https://t.co/NjoppIB4f9Today, @HouseBudgetDems RM @RepJohnYarmuth offered an amdt to close the carried interest loophole hedge fund managers use to avoid taxes—which would reduce deficits by $20B. @HouseBudgetGOP – who claims to care about the deficit – rejected it.  #GOPBudget https://t.co/V3o0ci8ijNDisappointed to see @HouseBudgetGOP vote down an amendment from @RepDWSTweets to protect retirees from harmful Social Security cuts in the @HouseBudgetGOP #BrighterForBillionares budget.

https://t.co/OrxtNxUBjUThank you to @janschakowsky for offering an amendment to #GOPBudget that would reject #ACA repeal &amp; #ProtectOurCare. Unfortunate that @HouseBudgetGOP opposed it &amp; want to increase health care costs.

https://t.co/GsDciS8z0BToday, @RepDelBene gave Congressional Republicans the opportunity to protect vital nutrition assistance programs instead of slashing them as their #GOPBudget seeks to do. #BrighterForBillionaires #ProtectSNAP
https://t.co/FbdyVBwqYGOur nation values families, &amp; we must not abide by these practices within our borders or in our name. We must reject this latest effort by @POTUS to use migrant children as bargaining chips. I urge @SpeakerRyan to bring @RepJerryNadler’s #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to the Floor now.For weeks @realDonaldTrump claimed only Congress could end this merciless policy. Today’s executive order is an admission both that he lied to America &amp; his attempt to hold children hostage has failed because of Americans’ outrage..@POTUS’s executive order does not resolve the crisis of his own making. It essentially switches from a system of separate detention camps for parents &amp; children to one where families are inhumanely detained together indefinitely. https://t.co/zs8lH4qQmv #FamiliesBelongTogetherI’m joining @NPRATC shortly to discuss @RealDonaldTrump’s merciless policy of separating migrant children from their parents.

It is a bold-faced lie for the President to claim otherwise.  He can and must end this crisis now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/tAxN7mCm10Thank you Senator McCain for speaking out against @realDonaldTrump’s merciless policy of ripping migrant children away from their parents. RT if you agree @POTUS must end this policy immediately. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/PB1A7WfsVzOnce again, @HouseBudgetGOP is relying on budget gimmicks &amp; short changing America’s working families with severe cuts to Medicare and Social Security. The #GOPBudget makes the future #BrighterForBillionares, not the middle class. https://t.co/7jDmkrMYa4Exactly 6 months after passing the #GOPTaxScam that explodes the deficit, @HouseBudgetGOP is marking up their #BrighterForBillionaires budget, which pays for tax cuts for the wealthy by cutting health care, retirement security, &amp; education. #GOPBudget https://t.co/oJx4TYRmu7I agree with former First Lady Laura Bush that @RealDonaldTrump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents is both cruel and immoral.

President Trump, this is your policy, and I urge you to end it now because #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/0z2a98XaI2Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will vote on two bills related to the #opioid crisis. https://t.co/sBKVlsm0gi.@AmerAcadPeds is speaking out against @RealDonaldTrump’s family separation policy, which they call “government-sanctioned child abuse.” 

@POTUS, it’s time to end this policy now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/UrceRSB7MUAs Republicans attempt to sell their unpopular #GOPTaxScam six months after final passage, I thank @RepMaxineWaters &amp; @FSCDems for speaking out on behalf of middle-class Americans left behind by the law. https://t.co/409JWDK3YHThis #Juneteenth, proud to stand with @OfficialCBC to fight against racism &amp; discrimination, stand up for the principle that every African American’s life matters, &amp; that he or she ought to be able to pursue every opportunity the U.S. offers – including the right to vote.As we mark #Juneteenth, let us remember the horrors of slavery &amp; segregation that followed.  Let us pay tribute to those who risked their lives for abolition, emancipation, justice, &amp; equality &amp; draw inspiration from them as we face injustice in our midst. https://t.co/fJrhSCT503 https://t.co/3ZZHkD3Zu2Democrats strongly oppose the anti-immigrant bills on the Floor this week – the Goodlatte proposal &amp; @SpeakerRyan’s bill. Read this @AmProg column on how they fail to end family separation at the border &amp; would hurt women and children: https://t.co/cACIKXwgSqI join my colleagues as a co-sponsor of @RepJerryNadler’s #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to end the Trump Admin’s inhumane policy of separating migrant children from their parents. I urge @SpeakerRyan to bring this bill to the Floor now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/66mF34nokz https://t.co/nXGriVvqLYI urge @HouseGOP to stop using the budget process for political messaging &amp; start working across the aisle to tackle the serious fiscal challenges we face – &amp; that their dangerous &amp; flawed policies have exacerbated.The budget unveiled by @HouseBudgetGOP today, 65 days overdue, cannot be considered a serious effort. It uses budget gimmicks, while putting deficit reduction on the backs of the most vulnerable, even after adding $1.8T to the deficit w the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/VOlaubGzxaThis is a lie. @RealDonaldTrump this is your policy, and you have the power to end it.

#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/bk54Bg9GWOSeparating families at the border is cruel &amp; inhumane. 327 #MD05 residents have called or written my office expressing outrage w/ the Trump Admin's policy while just 6 support it. I urge @POTUS to listen to the majority of Americans &amp; end this policy now. #FamiliesBelongTogetherAfter GOP failed to overcome broad opposition to repeal the #ACA, @Heritage &amp; the extreme wing of @HouseGOP are trying again to take health coverage away from millions, eliminate protections for pre-ex conditions, impose an age tax, &amp; threaten Medicare. https://t.co/rkaRIHZq3u4. And the bill – along with the Goodlatte legislation – has no chance of being signed into law. The process for bringing these bills to the Floor guarantees that Congress does not solve the #DACA crisis.3. The bill includes harsh limits on legal immigration, including ending the diversity visa program and family reunification, which has already been rejected in the Senate.2. Despite GOP claims, immigration experts have confirmed the bill will not end the Trump Administration’s merciless policy of separating children from their parents at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogether1. The bill wastes $25 billion on @RealDonaldTrump’s ineffective border wall.  Both Republicans in Congress and members of the Trump Administration have spoken out against the wall as an ineffective &amp; wasteful measure.For months, @SpeakerRyan promised to solve the #DACA crisis. Now, he is bringing 2 partisan proposals to the Floor, including Ryan’s “compromise” bill, which is really no compromise at all: https://t.co/C6AIBceZe2This week marks 6 months after the #GOPTaxScam was signed, &amp; this @TaxFoundation map shows just how dramatically the law cuts taxes for the top 1% of Americans while leaving the middle class behind: https://t.co/2ALQZZmnmA https://t.co/lebA6AV3yM.@POTUS, #FamiliesBelongTogether. It is shameful that Blanca hasn’t spoken to her 8 year old, Abel, in 2 months because of your policy that is separating migrant children from their parents. I urge you to rescind this policy. https://t.co/qrFvzSCesOI join @AppropsDems in calling for a hearing &amp; answers from the Trump Admin on how they are using federal funds to separate migrant children from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether &amp; Dems will continue to demand that this Admin reverse its policy. https://t.co/MqSp1GsFBOHappy birthday to my good friend, @RepJimCooper. Thank you for your commitment to addressing our nation’s fiscal health &amp; to bipartisan solutions as a member of @HouseBlueDogs.Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepPeteAguilar. Thank you for your leadership and work to solve the #DACA crisis and find a permanent, legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers.The junk plan rule announced today is a blatant effort to sabotage the #ACA &amp; will undermine consumer protections for millions of small biz owners &amp; their employees, increase premiums across the board, &amp; result in 130K more uninsured Americans by 2022. https://t.co/u46vw4gdFLI am at a loss for words. 

@SpeakerRyan, @HouseGOP, have you heard this recording? 

I urge you to demand that the President end this cruel, inhumane policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/i2kZRxBTSDToday on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider 18 bipartisan bills. Several are aimed at addressing the #opioid crisis. https://t.co/FF9u58jO2NSeparating migrant children from their parents is cruel, inhumane, &amp; morally bankrupt. 

#FamiliesBelongTogether, and @RealDonaldTrump has the power to direct @DHSgov to stop this policy it its tracks.

It is well past time he do so. https://t.co/NCzutEcT9mI also told reporters that ahead of the 6 month anniversary of the #GOPTaxScam, a majority of Americans continue to oppose the law because it blows a hole in the deficit, increases premiums for working families, undermines Medicare &amp; leaves small biz owners facing uncertainty.I also said to reporters that @HouseBudgetGOP will mark up a budget tomorrow, but I do not think it will make it to the Floor for a vote. After passing the deficit-exploding #GOPTaxScam, they can’t come up with a budget in an honest way.I also said to press today that @RealDonaldTrump’s policy of separating migrant parents &amp; children is not consistent with our nation’s values, morality, or faiths. @POTUS has the ability to end this policy and ought to now. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWhen speaking with reporters this morning, I said Democrats will oppose the Goodlatte proposal and @SpeakerRyan’s bill, which is not a real effort to address #DACA. This is a process that ducks the issue and is designed to fail.Appreciate Republican &amp; Democratic governors speaking out against the Trump Administration’s efforts to undo protections for 133 million Americans with pre-existing condition. I agree that the Admin's decision will hurt families &amp; must be reversed. https://t.co/Xn1Ylhwz37 https://t.co/ELVXRnDxEz.@RealDonaldTrump is separating children for the sole purpose of trying to build his wall and cease much of the legal immigration that has always made America great.  Shame on him.  Shame on all of us if we do not come together to stop it. #KeepFamiliesTogetherPresident Trump’s claim that this is a Democratic policy is a bold-faced lie. The American people must not be confused about what is taking place here: @POTUS has ordered children be torn from their parents’ arms, assigned numbers, &amp; held in what have been described as cages..@realDonaldTrump’s remarks today on family separation were tone deaf &amp; displayed a profound misunderstanding about what this country is about. There is precisely one individual who holds the fate of these children &amp; parents in his hands, &amp; that is @POTUS. https://t.co/Os9Wcz9I92Pleased to support the CARE Act, which would help ensure communities in MD have access to the resources they need to address the opioid crisis. I thank @RepCummings for introducing this important legislation. https://t.co/L5dM83RSfi https://t.co/cSxWOrD1NsIt’s nearly six months since @POTUS signed the #GOPtaxscam into law, and the American people still aren’t buying what Republicans are desperately trying to sell. Why? Because they know it’s a windfall for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. https://t.co/Zf7DiR9q2VHappy birthday to my friend, @RepPaulTonko. Thank you for your commitment to protecting our nation’s environment &amp; public health &amp; your work to highlight the importance of scientific research as a member of @EnergyCommerce.Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a committed advocate for sensible energy policy on @EnergyCommerce, @RepMcNerney.Today marks 3 years since the horrific shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC. My thoughts remain with the families who lost loved ones &amp; the African-American community in Charleston. We will never tire in the campaign against hatred &amp; injustice. #Charleston9 https://t.co/iWDr2gUxVLI thank my colleagues @RepJerryNadler, @FrankPallone, @RepSires, @RepMaloney, @BillPascrell, @RepJeffries, &amp; @RepEspaillat for spending today visiting separated parents at an ICE detention facility. https://t.co/nRmcLgVJ7jThis #FathersDay, my thoughts are with the fathers unable to spend today with their children because of @RealDonaldTrump’s merciless policy of separating families at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogether.Happy birthday to my friend and a committed advocate to #CA52’s working families on @EnergyCommerce, @RepScottPeters.Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and the longest serving woman in Congress, @RepMarcyKaptur. Thank you for your years of service representing the hardworking families of #OH09.Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member of @HASCDemocrats, @RepAdamSmith.Happy birthday to my friend, @RepRickLarsen. Thank you for your leadership as Ranking Member of @TransportDems’ Subcommittee on Aviation.Joined House Dems &amp; #DREAMers today to commemorate the 6th anniversary of #DACA. 

283 days ago @POTUS abruptly ended DACA &amp; challenged Congress to act. But @HouseGOP refuses to let the House work its will. We must act now to #protectDREAMers. https://t.co/tRivIJtyN7 https://t.co/4UIBnbw93YUnder the leadership of @EPAScottPruit, the Trump Admin has sought to severely cut funding to improve the health of the #ChesapeakeBay. The Bay is critical to the livelihood of communities throughout MD &amp; we must do all that we can to ensure its health for generations to come.Encouraging to see the health of the #ChesapeakeBay continues to improve. It’s important now more than ever that Congress continues to oppose efforts by the Trump Administration to defund programs that #ProtectOurBay. https://t.co/vnrHhTcGv6I’m troubled by @USOCC Otting’s refusal to acknowledge discrimination in the U.S. The Admin ought to support the Equal Credit Opportunity Act—a critical tool to combat discrimination against protected classes in the financial services industry. #OCCnoColor https://t.co/kTQ4BAO0IJOn Fridays, @GOPLeader &amp; I normally speak on the Floor about the schedule for the week ahead.

Today, he canceled because I suspect Republicans do not know the schedule or have a plan to address #DACA. 

It’s time to let the People’s House work its will &amp; #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/uBHrGlqGGPToday on the Floor, the House will vote on a GOP bill that seeks to incarcerate Americans instead of putting resources into treatment centers for opioid addiction &amp; educating families &amp; individuals impacted on how to help their loved ones. https://t.co/taSD0B77oXEnjoyed another successful #CongressionalBaseballGame celebrating bipartisanship &amp; raising money for charity. Great to see my friend @SteveScalise back on the field. Congratulations to the Democrats on another win! #GoDems #CBG18 https://t.co/SRuL7qySm5On this Eid-al-Fitr, as I join in wishing celebrants an Eid Mubarak, I pray that our country will continue to grow stronger from the blessing of our diversity – and the richness that Muslim-American communities add to it. https://t.co/jDRa13vRGJ https://t.co/E7STWif1pCThank you all for the kind birthday wishes today. Pleased to celebrate my birthday cheering on the Democrats at tonight’s #CongressionalBaseballGame! Go Dems! #CBG18.@HouseGOP’s immigration bill unveiled by @SpeakerRyan is no compromise at all. It is an anti-immigrant bill, simply put. Democrats will oppose it because it is a pretense for addressing this crisis with a guarantee that it won’t. https://t.co/B9sdPdxvrAThe FBI &amp; special counsel ought to be allowed to carry out their investigations unimpeded &amp; Congress ought to take steps to protect Mueller’s investigation so that the American people can learn the truth.While the report identifies a number of ways the FBI and Justice Department could have done better, it concludes that there was no political motivation..@POTUS continues to try to undermine Americans’ independent law enforcement institutions to defend himself against the special counsel’s investigation.  Today’s #IGReport and the GOP reaction to it are the latest in that effort. https://t.co/O7MvqTeQrb #WeDemandTheTruthMust-read from the @WashingtonPost on the #GOPTaxScam: The Republican tax bill’s promises of higher wages and more jobs haven’t materialized https://t.co/tqbtdwGhSFGlad to join MD Delegation this afternoon to discuss ways we can work to close the racial wealth gap in our state. Congress must be doing all the it can to ensure every American has access to economic opportunity. https://t.co/3jPlmlM1Cu https://t.co/bHPo0VBbWZThank you @CongBoyle for introducing bipartisan legislation to ensure the Trump Administration does not lift sanctions on North Korea without transparency and progress on human rights violations in that country. https://t.co/6MxxVRiLBUWishing a happy 243rd birthday to the oldest branch of the military, the @USArmy. Thank you to the brave men and women of the U.S. Army for your years of service and sacrifice to keep our nation safe. #ArmyBDay https://t.co/GPwodR6ZWf#OTD in 1777, U.S. Congress passed a law establishing an official flag for the United States of America. Happy #FlagDay to all Americans, especially to those who have sacrificed to defend it. https://t.co/veDdfMa7ceLeader McConnell, if you support protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, why did you and Senate Republicans vote to repeal these protections last year in the #TrumpCare bill? https://t.co/pqSSSyuoTzJoined fellow Democrats in calling on @POTUS to rescind Executive Orders that target whistleblowers and undermine our federal civilian workforce. https://t.co/SsY08nghrbIf the Trump Administration has it their way, 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose their health coverage. RT if you agree that's unacceptable. https://t.co/UdiPHx3mFJ https://t.co/iTM3QKULtnI thank @FrankPallone, @RepRichardNeal, @RepJerryNadler, &amp; @BobbyScott for holding the Trump Administration accountable for their efforts to sabotage the #ACA &amp; remove protections for more than 130 million Americans living with pre-existing conditions. Read their letter here: https://t.co/3z1edh0zUPThank you @rweingarten &amp; @AFTunion leaders for addressing House Democrats this morning about the passionate educators across the country speaking out for equitable pay and benefits. https://t.co/bUpfuQkSuiThis time the Senator from @EPAScottPruitt's home state of Oklahoma is speaking out against his use of his @EPA position for personal gain. Retweet if you agree: it is past time to #BootPruitt. https://t.co/I0yKgArqeBThis is merciless and cruel. The Trump Administration’s actions are inflicting irreparable harm on children and parents through their policy of separating migrant families. The Administration must rescind this policy immediately. https://t.co/xlbbcBJFXOFor months – 281 days to be exact – @SpeakerRyan has promised to address the #DACA crisis created by @POTUS. Instead, he has refused to let the House work its will on bipartisan proposals. Here’s a review of the promises Speaker Ryan made:  https://t.co/Zgfq4HTHT6The GOP is continuing their stealth attack on the #ACA &amp; benefits it has provided for millions of Americans. Joined my colleagues to speak out against the Admin's attempt to allow insurance companies to deny coverage to 133M Americans w pre-ex conditions. https://t.co/GCUJxnapWI https://t.co/pB96HOrKxTToday on the Floor, the House will consider twelve bipartisan bills to address the #opioid crisis. https://t.co/rTlfh8qS8HHappy birthday to my friend and fellow @Capitals fan, @EleanorNorton. Thank you for your leadership as Ranking Member of @TransportDems’ House Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @HouseJudDems, @RepJerryNadler.Instead of allowing the House to work its will &amp; vote on a bipartisan compromise bill to address the #DACA crisis &amp; end uncertainty for #DREAMers, @SpeakerRyan continues to dissemble &amp; delay. Now, he offers vague promises on bills he knows will not pass. https://t.co/TgCWKfafELOver 130 MILLION Americans with pre-existing conditions are protected under the ACA. Last week, the Trump Administration announced that it wants to take away those vital protections. #ProtectOurCare
Tune in here at 12 noon ET: https://t.co/jFTKqWYZIn.@SpeakerRyan's vague promise to bring a #DACA bill to the Floor is a pretend attempt to appear that he is addressing this crisis when he is not. I urge him to allow the House to proceed with the "Queen of the Hill" process that a majority would support. https://t.co/TgCWKeSENdThis is not who we are as a people, &amp; Americans will surely never abide such treatment of innocent children in their name.  President Trump &amp; Attorney General Sessions should stop separating migrant families in the first place. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/pMFEdSI3cWIt is horrifying that the Trump Admin is not only prying young children from their parents’ arms but also considering placing them in tent cities. The Administration should abandon these plans immediately.  https://t.co/pDLSIyLiPOVery impressed by the presentation from the @GirlScouts robotics team at the #CapMakerFaire this afternoon, which was hosted by my friend &amp; co-chair of the Congressional Makers Caucus, @RepMarkTakano. https://t.co/hrqKQQ2cVYWishing a happy birthday to my good friend and founder and co-chair of the Women’s Working Group on #ImmigrationReform, @RepRoybalAllard. Thank you for your continued leadership on immigration reform and commitment to a permanent, legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers.Today, the @BLS_gov wages report confirms working men &amp; women are not seeing wage increases from the #GOPTaxScam. In fact, they’ve fallen over the last year under @RealDonaldTrump.

We should move fwd with the petition.I also told press that the Trump Admin’s refusal to defend the #ACA is more evidence the GOP is doing everything in their power to undermine the law. Their attempt to gut the law could result in over 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions losing coverage.I said to press that the #TrumpKimSummit was a made-for-TV visual that lacked substance, which is even more troubling after the President alienated historic allies that share our values at the G7.I told reporters this morning that it’s appropriate for Congress to take steps to address the opioid epidemic, but the rule bills on the Floor do not make significant investments in addiction treatment.Read my joint statement with @NancyPelosi, @RepEliotEngel, @RepAdamSmith, &amp; @RepAdamSchiff on the #TrumpKimSummit: https://t.co/RlqA6FjHuA https://t.co/wPvf5Rv0kRThe headlines say it all: the Trump Administration is deliberately sabotaging Americans’ health care &amp; taking steps to kick 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions off coverage.

While decisions like today’s frustrate this effort, Dems will keep up this fight as long as it takes to ensure that every American’s right to vote is secured.Disappointed by today’s ruling in #HustedvAPRI. The decision is a setback for #votingrights &amp; sends a dangerous signal to GOP-led states that they can disenfranchise voters through purges, which disproportionately affect minorities &amp; working families. https://t.co/qc1WLJSle9Thank you @RepJayapal for lifting up the stories of families who are being torn apart by @DHSgov’s policy of separating children from parents who are seeking asylum in the United States. This policy is inflicting unspeakable harm and must be reversed. https://t.co/ZYC4uEznjuI encourage all to read this @BostonGlobe article on the impact of the Trump Admin’s policy of separating children from parents at the border.

While we have made progress, women still only earn an average of $0.80 to a man’s dollar &amp; the wage gap for minority women is even larger.  This is both unjust &amp; economically harmful. https://t.co/RU7ilHs2xR https://t.co/vm2IyqYTEgEncouraged that @USEdGov has awarded funds to #GreatMills HS for mental health resources following March’s tragic shooting, but Congress must be doing more to prevent gun violence in our schools. https://t.co/ruro2qXuNrYou would be correct. #ALLCAPS https://t.co/F3IEPBaajlHeading into the weekend cheering #ALLCAPS! https://t.co/iNreCxoR4eAs @EPAScottPruitt &amp; @HouseGOP continue to undermine environmental &amp; public health protections, Dems are offering #ABetterDeal – one that maintains public lands, protects clean air &amp; water, &amp; invests in renewable energy.Raising premiums on millions of Americans wasn’t enough for @realDonaldTrump.

Last night his Admin took steps to gut the #ACA &amp; kick 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions off coverage.

RT if you agree that’s unacceptable. #ProtectOurCare: https://t.co/BEn5JxOB2zThe #GOPTaxScam is a bad deal for the American people.

I join my colleagues in urging @RealDonaldTrump to reverse this heartless policy of tearing families apart. https://t.co/Kprk8I1YXc.@RealDonaldTrump &amp; @HouseGOP failed to repeal the #ACA, so they are sabotaging the law instead.

Now, working families are paying the price. 

RT to spread the word that Republicans are increasing health care costs. https://t.co/ED5FSAIQNhThe GOP’s rescissions package is a shameless attempt to gloss over the $1.8 trillion they added to the deficit as a result of the #GOPTaxScam.

RT if you agree. https://t.co/8poMS1N7CwWishing a happy birthday to my good friend &amp; Chair of the @DCCC, @RepBenRayLujan.On the Floor, the House will vote on @HouseGOP’s hypocritical rescissions bill that doesn’t come close to addressing the enormous deficits incurred as a result of the #GOPTaxScam.

Congress ought to have the opportunity to est a baseline before any negotiation. https://t.co/BYLwW7Nq26On the 50th anniversary of the death of #RobertFKennedy, we remember his life of service &amp; we continue to fight for the causes he held dear – eradicating poverty, inequality, &amp; indignity wherever they are found. https://t.co/ax41uceobF #RFK50 https://t.co/qwly41KBzjThis afternoon, I am joining @Kasie on @MSNBC around 3:40 p.m. Tune in.Today, the House will consider 2 bills. The first bill aims to reduce violent crime by improving partnerships between local law enforcement &amp; communities. The 2nd authorizes @USACEHQ to carry out water resources development activities across the country. https://t.co/bwgAUSIZtsThe minibus on the Floor this week – which includes funding bills for Energy &amp; Water, Leg Branch, &amp; MilCon-VA – fails to fully fund critical domestic programs &amp; includes riders that jeopardize enviro protections &amp; public health. Learn more here: https://t.co/ecoxcuorqT https://t.co/ho1f4REql6Members from both sides of the aisle are speaking out against @EPAScottPruitt’s use of his office for personal gain. Retweet if you agree it’s time to #BootPruitt. https://t.co/64rw6y7r32Today marks the 74th anniversary of American forces storming the beaches of Normandy during #WWII. We pause to remember their service &amp; sacrifice, honor their bravery, &amp; recommit ourselves to preserving the stories of veterans for generations to come. #DDay74 https://t.co/x2AL8JCSR1As a proud Danish-American, and co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, I was pleased to join the Danish #ConstitutionDay celebration this evening at @DenmarkinUSA and honor Danish veterans. Thank you to my friend @DKambUSA for the opportunity to speak. https://t.co/03tsyMyP6WOn #WorldEnvironmentDay, we recognize the beauty of our National Parks &amp; protected lands, including #MD’s Chesapeake Bay &amp; it’s tributaries. Today, we recommit ourselves to #ProtectOurBay &amp; support environmental protections here at home &amp; across the globe. https://t.co/IV0bLtDLikI urge Republicans in Congress &amp; @RealDonaldTrump to cease their efforts to undermine health care in America &amp; work with Democrats to safeguard Medicare &amp; Social Security for the next generation.Alarmed Medicare will become insolvent in 2026, 3 yrs earlier than previously projected, &amp; Social Security will become insolvent in 2034 – due largely to #GOPTaxScam &amp; slower long-term economic growth. Both speak directly to the failures of GOP policies.  https://t.co/0YfWkbwyWJThe real heart of the case against POTUS’ rescissions package is that none of his proposals have come close to addressing even in small part the enormous deficits incurred from the #GOPTaxScam. The new rescissions package proposed today is, like its predecessor, a sham.The Trump Administration seems to be doing the best job at making the argument against its own rescissions proposal.  Their updated package directly undercuts its case that money it proposed for rescission would never be spent anyway. https://t.co/uKFB0JgJw7At today’s press conf, I told reporters about the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour I led last week w @RepBarbaraLee. We toured sites in #Dallas with @RepVeasey &amp; @RepEBJ to hear directly from Americans living in poverty &amp; stakeholders who are working to alleviate poverty.I also told press that @SpeakerRyan has promised to bring #DACA legislation to the Floor for months and has failed to do so. The discharge petition would allow consideration of 4 bills, including a proposal by the Speaker. How much fairer can a process be?Today, I told the press that I oppose the process and the policy in the minibus appropriations bill that Republicans are bringing to the Floor this week. By packaging bills together, it limits debate and sets up gotcha votes. The bill also includes several problematic provisions.Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider seven bills. https://t.co/hY2X1CcivZGOP efforts to undermine programs that struggling families rely on are dangerous &amp; must be reversed. The Dem Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, &amp; Opportunity will shine a light on the issue of poverty &amp; propose policies that can lift Americans into the middle class.We just returned from the 1st leg of the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour in #Dallas where we heard from families &amp; advocates who would suffer from cuts and policy changes by this Administration and the Republican-led Congress.The assessment by a @UN official that the Trump Admin’s actions are exacerbating poverty in America ought to alarm Americans. Read my statement with @RepBarbaraLee here: https://t.co/E1CcylBZooToday marks 29 years since the massacre at China’s #TiananmenSquare. I join in remembering the individuals who stood up that day for human rights and basic freedoms and the bravery of Lou Xiaobao and other democracy advocates. https://t.co/rXKENi3B4kThis decision has been a powerful reminder that civil rights &amp; equality in America remains a work in progress.  I will continue to work with #LGBT &amp; civil rights orgs to advance equality &amp; non-discrimination.  The march of progress, freedom, &amp; human dignity will not be deterred.I am disappointed by today’s #MasterpieceCakeshop decision.  However, #SCOTUS made clear in its narrow ruling that this case sets no precedent &amp; #LGBT Americans have a right not to face discrimination from businesses refusing to serve them. #OpenforAll  https://t.co/0DNMPsgiynGlad to join in honoring outstanding #MD05 educators today. I’m proud that MD leads the country when it comes to educating our children. We must do more to ensure our educators have the resources they need to help every student succeed. https://t.co/0uZuchlVIt https://t.co/0812ZjBGirI will continue working closely with my colleagues in the @LGBTEqCaucus to promote legislation, like the #Equality Act, that ends discrimination based on sexual orientation &amp; gender identity once &amp; for all &amp; to defend the victories won against those who would turn the clock back.This month, we celebrate #LGBT #PrideMonth &amp; pay tribute to the individuals &amp; organizations whose actions have paved the difficult road to equality. This month, let us recommit ourselves to the work of eliminating the discrimination that continues.  https://t.co/6f9rxnTeJ6 https://t.co/AgtpISy1UYToday, I wear orange in honor of Great Mills High School student Jaelynn Willey whose life was cut short by gun violence. For Jaelynn &amp; all students, we say #NeverAgain &amp; pledge to continue the fight to #EndGunViolence.On #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I join my colleagues &amp; #WearOrange in recognition of the thousands of Americans lost to gun violence every year. Moments of silence are not enough. We must take action to #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/A1n76r7xKIDuring #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, we reflect on the contributions of the many immigrants who have made America their home. We remember the forces that drove our ancestors to seek shelter &amp; opportunity in the U.S. continue to attract newcomers today.  https://t.co/Uh4dVAInwZ https://t.co/xi2zB9pJ7c.@RepBarbaraLee, @RepEBJ, @RepVeasey &amp; I were pleased to be able to bring together community stakeholders on the front lines of poverty in #Dallas to discuss how Congress can build on successful anti-poverty programs &amp; lift more people out of poverty. #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour https://t.co/SBdytqt7ec.@PromiseHouse provides emergency shelter to many young people experiencing homelessness, including LGBT youth and new mothers. We learned how they are providing youth with the skills and services they’ll need to live independently in the future. #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour https://t.co/88e2vNDpqGPleased to tour @JubileePark as part of the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour. This community center provides local residents with comprehensive services – such as child care, adult education, recreation for youth, and housing for seniors – to help break the cycle of poverty. https://t.co/PxxyWO6hXZI thank Darren Babcock of @BontonFarms for raising important issues we must address in order to break the cycle of poverty, including expanding access to nutritious foods, affordable housing, and transportation as well as prison and sentencing reform.In addition, @BontonFarms is located in a community where 85% of men have been to prison. At the farm, they employ individuals coming out of prison or other difficult circumstances and are working to provide opportunity and revitalize lives..@BontonFarms is in a food desert, where it takes local residents 3 hrs to make a trip to the grocery store on public transit. As a result, there are large health disparities, including higher cancer &amp; obesity rates. This farm is a model for addressing this challenge.Today, @RepBarbaraLee, @RepVeasey, @RepEBJ, &amp; I are proud to be visiting @BontonFarms as part of the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour. As one of the largest urban farms in the US, they are working to expand access to nutritious foods while creating jobs for local residents. https://t.co/AE48eWSR7lRead @TheHill’s story today about the first stop of the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour with @RepBarbaraLee, @RepEBJ, &amp; @RepVeasey &amp; our plans to take what we hear from Americans to shape Dems’ policies to alleviate poverty.  https://t.co/0R5juQBdQZ.@POTUS’ decision to withdraw from #ParisAgreement 1 yr ago hurt our standing w allies, undermines public health, &amp; cedes leadership in developing clean energy. I continue to stand w @CaucusonClimate, House Dems, &amp; majority of Americans who believe we must #ActonClimate. #StillInJobs report is welcome news that the economy continues to sustain job creation, although at a muted pace compared to the height of the recovery. @POTUS continues to play dangerous games with economic policy that are not paying off for American workers. https://t.co/xKMgtBGzAhToday, I am kicking off the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour in #Dallas with @RepBarbaraLee, @RepEBJ, &amp; @RepVeasey to hear directly from Americans living in poverty and stakeholders who are working to alleviate poverty. https://t.co/18bQdzP46oChina is unfairly dumping cheap steel &amp; aluminum onto global markets, but Trump Admin's decision to impose new tariffs on allies continues pattern of focusing on wrong target for wrong reasons. These actions hurt American businesses, workers, &amp; consumers. https://t.co/QrS1xBxbXbThe United States will continue to stand by Israel as it defends itself against terror and violence.  I will continue to pay close attention to events on the ground and make it clear that support for Israel in our country remains bipartisan and robust.The latest attacks by Hamas and Islamic Jihad from Gaza against civilians in Israel underscore the danger facing our ally every day.  Attacks like these remind us who is truly keeping Palestinians’ aspirations from being met. https://t.co/592Rky0ktkThe Trump Admin ought to remember these are #OurFellowAmericans &amp; do everything they can to help them rebuild. With the next storm season on our doorstep, we must ensure that all resources are in place to respond appropriately.That many of these deaths were preventable and due to inadequate provision of emergency resources and medical care is even more disturbing.  Each one of these deaths represents a family suffering loss and heartbreak.Reports that more than 4,645 of #OurFellowAmericans died as a result of Hurricane Maria in #PuertoRico, contrary to the Trump Administration’s number of 64, are deeply alarming and upsetting.  https://t.co/PmGJYGrByGThroughout our history, this country has been strengthened by the courage and devotion of Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice under our flag. On #MemorialDay, we pause to pay our respects &amp; give them our thanks. https://t.co/Me0i9uPMnF https://t.co/HIxmeeASU0Happy birthday to my friend and founder and co-chair of the bipartisan HBCU caucus, @RepAdams.Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @TransportDems, @RepPeterDeFazio.Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, and Chief Deputy Whip, @JanSchakowsky. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to ensuring all Americans have access to affordable, quality health care..@POTUS’ executive orders attacking federal employees will be devastating for families across the country. The dedicated men &amp; women who make up our federal workforce deserve better than constant attacks by President Trump &amp; Republicans in Congress. https://t.co/H9dC7fdVZeAppreciated meeting w @PGCOC &amp; @LeidosInc to discuss different ways the business community can take steps to address the opioid epidemic in our communities. https://t.co/JJ0IUpz9jl https://t.co/dhxEqVHSetYesterday’s analysis of @POTUS’ Budget by @USCBO provides additional evidence that the #GOPTaxScam will neither provide the massive economic growth its authors promised nor lift wages for working people. https://t.co/9IWbe5gZlcHonored to join in thanking our Vietnam veterans in #MD05 for their service. I was glad to present Col. William Holmes with medals for his distinguished service, which had not previously been presented.  
https://t.co/alvorrrUP8 https://t.co/njU3NkN7fo.@ChuckGrassley is right that conservatives should not support the current #GOPFarmBill, which opens up new loopholes to give subsidies to wealthy non-farmers https://t.co/Ydu6qfFzodPleased to speak with impressive students at Grace Christian Academy in Waldorf today to discuss the importance of civic engagement. https://t.co/nAPf41Ib18What @RealDonaldTrump &amp; @SpeakerRyan told working Americans: the #GOPTaxScam would create jobs here.
 
What actually happened: workers were laid off &amp; jobs are being shipped overseas.
 
While House Dems are offering #ABetterDeal, the GOP is leaving Americans with a raw deal. https://t.co/0kKfzRhG4wICYMI - I joined @RepRaskin earlier this week to discuss the importance of protecting our election infrastructure ahead of the 2018 election. Watch our conversation here: https://t.co/ATuuwdAbxc https://t.co/aop7E3sZzkWhile I supported this bill today, I remain concerned about certain provisions, including harmful environmental riders as well as cuts to non-uniformed Pentagon personnel often working alongside uniformed service members, to contribute to our national defense.Pleased Dems &amp; Republicans came together to pass the bipartisan #FY19NDAA. I thank @RepAdamSmith &amp; @HASCDemocrats for their tireless efforts to keep this bill bipartisan &amp; prevent the worst GOP amendments from being added in committee or on the Floor. https://t.co/OOThuvlIVnWishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @HouseJudDems’ Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, @RepCohen.From the beginning to now, the dealings with #NorthKorea have been sophomoric &amp; w/o strategic or tactical merit. While #NorthKorea’s history has shown them to be untrustworthy &amp; duplicitous, this Admin’s actions have heightened the danger posed by North Korea’s reckless behavior.The President’s letter to North Korea is a sad example of the petulance &amp; shallowness of the foreign policy being pursued by @POTUS. It is another demonstration of POTUS’ treating of critical negotiations as if they were just another real estate deal. https://t.co/3JswF0SrDnI was proud to see the @Capitals win last night &amp; move on to the #StanleyCup Final. Congrats to the team and all Caps fans in the region! #DCProud #ALLCAPS #4MoreWins.@SpeakerRyan promised workers at Harley-Davidson the #GOPTaxScam would “keep jobs here in America.” Instead, Harley-Davidson took their tax cut, enriched shareholders, laid off workers, &amp; shipped their jobs overseas. Here’s what those workers have to say: https://t.co/bPxeRdUg5uToday on the Floor, the House of Representatives is voting on the bipartisan #FY19NDAA. https://t.co/5USGrr5HCcWishing everyone, especially @UofMaryland #Terps, a happy #WorldTurtleDay! #FearTheTurtle #GoTerps https://t.co/ZG3EfOVO3FThe American people will not be fooled; they can see Republicans’ sabotage of our health care system for what it is. I call on Republicans to stop recklessly sabotaging the #ACA, which undermines insurance markets &amp; harms consumers, &amp; instead work with us to strengthen the law..@USCBO confirms GOP sabotage of the #ACA is raising Americans’ premiums &amp; kicking them off coverage. By their estimation, premiums will go up an average of 15% &amp; 3M Americans will lose coverage next year due to the GOP’s work to undermine the law. https://t.co/b0dlxbEB7sToday, @HouseGOP held a hearing to sell their #GOPTaxScam as a gift to small businesses, but small biz owners see right through that and know the law overwhelmingly benefits large corporations and wealthy Americans. https://t.co/F3mE4mtX0W#DREAMers can still apply to renew #DACA protections. Sign up to renew here &amp; RT to urge @HouseGOP leadership to allow the House to work its will to #ProtectDREAMers so DREAMers have certainty they can remain here and pursue a pathway to citizenship → https://t.co/cyC7AVKtal https://t.co/6h9V5huckQWishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepDinaTitus. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to modernizing infrastructure as Ranking Member on @TransportDems’ Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Subcommittee.While @HouseGOP attempts to sell the #GOPTaxScam with a hearing today, small business owners are speaking out against the law who are frustrated by the tax law’s confusion. https://t.co/lTIO6qvJ85In addition to giving the wealthiest Americans and large corporations a massive tax cut, the #GOPTaxScam is kicking millions of Americans off health coverage &amp; increasing health care costs for America’s small business owners &amp; their employees. https://t.co/hvaTbYydHLRight now, @WaysandMeansGOP is holding another hearing on the #GOPTaxScam in order to sell the law, but small business owners around the country know the law favors large corporations and stacks the deck against them. https://t.co/8GgXrSMDJGToday on the Floor, the House of Representatives will continue consideration of #FY19NDAA.  https://t.co/bONPvXZI3dIf @HouseGOP want to continue to focus a national conversation on their unpopular #GOPTaxScam, that helps big corporations over small businesses, that's their choice. Dems will continue to highlight GOP’s prioritizing of the wealthiest over those working hard every day to get by.As a result of a more-complicated tax code that came out of Republicans’ rush to pass their bill with no hearings or full debate, small businesses are facing deep uncertainty over how the law applies to them and what its impact will be.While today’s hearing is an attempt to claim that small businesses will flourish, every outside analysis shows that the #GOPTaxScam overwhelmingly advantages multinational corporations while ignoring small businesses on Main Streets across America.Once again, @WaysandMeansGOP seems to believe that they can rebrand their #GOPTaxScam that advantages the wealthy over the middle class with a Congressional hearing today packed with cherry-picked witnesses.  https://t.co/xH8Z80IuuTRepublicans promised Americans that their #GOPTaxScam would raise wages &amp; create jobs.

The reality?

Businesses are taking their tax cut, rewarding shareholders, closing factories, &amp; moving jobs overseas.

This is yet another example of the law leaving American workers behind. https://t.co/V2pv442qUcThese amendments will strengthen our intelligence gathering, cyber-defenses, &amp; encourage cooperation with international allies and partners to combat Russian attempts to subvert our democracy.Yesterday @RepValDemings &amp; @RepTedLieu introduced important legislation to confront Russian attempts to interfere in our elections; pleased to see two provisions from that bill will be considered as amendments during debate of #FY19NDAA. https://t.co/WDSETPZUXuHonored to meet with &amp; hear the painstaking stories from activist Igor Kochetkov, who, along with journalist Elena Milashina, exposed the violent repression of #LGBT people in Chechnya. Congratulations on your well-deserved @FreedomHouse 2018 Freedom Award. https://t.co/uQdshVlzpkGlad to meet with @AmbKawar of Jordan, a close ally of the United States. I thank her for joining me on Capitol Hill yesterday to discuss common challenges, including Syria. We will continue to work together on these issues. https://t.co/pSWe7s1TcOPleased to see U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of @GavinGrimmVA saying #transgender students are protected against the discriminatory guidance forcing them to use separate bathrooms. https://t.co/dNAVEIxbShI will continue working with @RepJeffries and others to push for legislation that tackles sentencing disparities, which remain a blemish on our justice system.Pleased to see the House come together &amp; pass @RepJeffries’ #FirstStepAct. I hope this legislation will be used as a first step to address some of the most serious problems plaguing our prison system. https://t.co/Vkcd007lSrWe must deter Russian attacks on our democracy &amp; efforts to undermine U.S. interests.  I thank @RepValDemings &amp; @RepTedLieu for introducing a bipartisan bill to counter this threat &amp; strengthen cybersecurity, support intel agencies, &amp; enhance our cooperation w @NATO &amp; allies. https://t.co/WDSETPZUXuIt’s been nearly six-months after the #GOPTaxScam became law, and what are large corporations doing with their benefits? 

Hiring workers?

No, rewarding investors. https://t.co/aBfdcVS5RB
