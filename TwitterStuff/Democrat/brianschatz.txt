They are coming after your healthcare.So which Democratic candidate are you either giving to or volunteering for this week and why? Looking forward to hearing about all the great people stepping up.So many coincidences which are probably very innocent and very normal even though billions of dollars were exchanged.If you have high blood pressure, asthma, heart disease, acne, a bad back or are a woman, the Republicans are working relentlessly, in all 3 branches of government, to allow insurance companies to jack up your rates or not insure you at all. You have to retaliate by voting.Nobody thought we could save ACA, but we did. How did we do it? 1) Millions of phone calls into Congress 2) Unity among Democrats 3) A clear message about the stakes.
We‚Äôve got work to do. Let‚Äôs get started.There‚Äôs just no way to argue that he‚Äôs advancing American interests here. https://t.co/yOaSeJjWAa(How come I got asked by multiple national media outlets about a restaurant owner in Alexandria but oh never mind I guess asymmetrical polarization or something enjoy your Thursday.) https://t.co/vljHzVqOQhI appreciate journalists, journalism, and the First Amendment. I‚Äôm so, so sorry for what has happened in that newsroom and I can imagine the fear it causes nationwide for people in the profession.Let‚Äôs not outsmart ourselves. This is about whether or not women have choice .This year was already the year of the woman, politically, but now the stakes are even higher. It is not an exaggeration to say that millions of women across the country will suffer and lose a fundamental right if Trump gets what he wants.THIS https://t.co/K5SIqHCrYOThere is no clever tweet, no well-crafted argument for cable news, that will lay bare Republican hypocrisy on the Court and bring them to their knees under the weight of the embarrassment. We just have to win the next election.Fight. Organize. Talk. Tweet. Call. Donate. Volunteer. Win.PLEASE RETWEET IF YOU AGREE. https://t.co/bDgoOzL5RZI don‚Äôt have words of consolation or inspiration - only that their side fights hard, and together, and we have to treat this like what it is - the fight for the very soul of our country. We need to give this all we‚Äôve got, because millions, and generations to come, depend on it.If there is any lesson to take from this debacle of almost immeasurable magnitude it is that we CANNOT SIT OUT THE MID TERMS.If you care about reproductive choice it is time to change from a passive to an active participant in politics. Everything we hold dear in on the line this October and November. A new Supreme Court will in fact overturn Roe, and women‚Äôs rights will be set back a half a century.I know it‚Äôs not that big of a deal but a bill without Democrats is not a compromise.@axios This was a compromise among Republicans so maybe it wasn‚Äôt a compromise?This is so good. https://t.co/iXuynUXCpkThere are lots of great choices in the Hawai`i Democratic Primary August 11. Many on the ballot are good friends and colleagues. I wish all the best of luck, and look forward to a spirited and clean race. I will not be endorsing anyone in any of the big contests. Please vote!Now more than ever, we must all stand with, and on the shoulders of, organized labor. They are the best institutional counterweight to right wing superpacs, and they are the best strategy to build the middle class. Labor has my back, and I‚Äôve got labors‚Äô back.The one thing that is for sure is that our side does not have an enthusiasm problem.Where are the children. https://t.co/qy6sL3bzYJWhere. Are. The. Children.@jwpetersNYT But even given the limitations of this platform would you like to amend your statement or add to it?I know this news was overtaken yesterday by other more important issues (üôÑ) but these kids are still missing and this government is still belligerent and incompetent. https://t.co/Db7rCWUiDV@jwpetersNYT This seems a bit incomplete as analysis.It will get better. It really will. But we have to pour everything we‚Äôve got - organizationally, financially, emotionally, politically, into turning it around. Our people are more noble, more kind, more fair, and more reverent of our founding ideals, than our government. VOTE.The silver lining is that until now the Korematsu Case, which held that the internment of Japanese Americans was legal, has finally been officially rejected by SCOTUS. https://t.co/KEui5VklAc2/2 
SCOTUS made the wrong decision and ignored the evidence that the Muslim ban, even the more narrowly tailored version, is a xenophobic policy that makes our country no safer than before. The American people know the truth about the Muslim ban: it is un-American.‚ÄùMy statement on Hawai`i vs Trump: 1/2
What is legal is not always just. A narrow ruling on whether or not the president is in possession of statutory authority to implement this policy avoids the basic question of whether or not it‚Äôs the right thing to do.This is happening in every state. And the official filings from insurance companies specifically cite Republican sabotage driving these massive rate increases. https://t.co/NjrDP3PPph@aaro53555355 Thank you. I needed that.@baseballcrank Good morning! I‚Äôm not sure what you mean or how you are characterizing my tweet. So: I just think it‚Äôs important that people know they are taxes - many don‚Äôt know that.  Also, that his trade war is bad for our country.Tariffs are taxes and this isn‚Äôt working.‚ÄúWhere are the children‚Äù isn‚Äôt a political slogan. It is the most urgent moral question for today.  Because of cruelty and incompetence, we must ask ‚Äúwhere are the children‚Äù until they are all reunited. Whatever your profession, please ask that question today.Tomorrow: Healthcare and the kids. Healthcare and the kids.Trade wars hurt Americans. Tariffs are taxes. People deserve healthcare whether or not they have a pre existing health condition. Medicaid works. College should be affordable. Marijuana shouldn‚Äôt be the reason someone is in prison. Elections matter.People don‚Äôt like cruelty as official policy. It‚Äôs not not just morally bankrupt it‚Äôs bad politics. https://t.co/6vQKRkAzCNThis Red Hen (they are taking) controversy (away protections for the 52 million Americans) shows that the lack of civility (with pre existing conditions) has gotten worse than ever.@DoberMom2 @jonfavs @SenSherrodBrown Just spent the weekend all across Ohio for Sherrod. He‚Äôs good people and they do love him.@CustomChuck NoWho is your favorite House or Senate candidate and how much are you giving this week?One of the things the Democratic coalition needs to lean harder into is to support unions. Not just union members, not just ‚Äúworking families, not just ‚Äúprogressive priorities,‚Äù but the unions themselves as institutions. They remain the best path to rebuilding the middle class.They want us fighting with each other. On strategy, on Bernie vs HRC, on brown vs white, on rural vs urban. Because the tax cut is the largest upward wealth transfer in history, and they are trying to take your healthcare. If we talk about healthcare and taxes we win. If not, ?Is the reason that Trump is doing so well w R‚Äôs that old school R‚Äôs are quietly leaving the Party and calling themselves Independent?Healthcare costs will skyrocket due to R sabotage. The tax cuts are unpopular because they are a giveaway to the most profitable corporations in history. The deficit they just created is being used by R‚Äôs to justify cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and social security. Please vote.THREAD. https://t.co/6iNxRd9zcTCalling racism racism is less offensive than racism.I‚Äôm not a data guy but this seems good. https://t.co/xiZZmZz1kjI just heard about a restaurant kicking Sarah Sanders out of a restaurant and it‚Äôs got me thinking that Democrats have to be talking about health care today and every day till the election.Civility is great. Fighting institutional cruelty is currently a higher priority!@wcbrooks @AndyRichter Senator Patrick Leahy does just that and R‚Äôs won‚Äôt schedule it.Democrats have specific plans on 1) universal healthcare 2) prescription drugs 3) economic stagnation 4) affordable higher ed 5) climate 6) immigration and so on but we apologize for our difficulty breaking through with our white papers while BABIES ARE IN CAGESThe secret that many people don‚Äôt know is that a straight up or down vote on the wall in the Senate would fail because because R‚Äôs quietly hate this stupid profligate useless monument to a campaign slogan.If we allow cruelty as government policy to open a legislative negotiation, and if it succeeds, it will never stop.  https://t.co/MN4foLRwTqHahahahhahhahaha. https://t.co/exqjkIITle@HIRONIMUS1 This is a joke. I think it is not unfair.This is unfair. The Democrats have plenty of extreme nominees who, for example want all Americans to have healthcare. https://t.co/TeRK6y15fgIt is important to remember that every GOP Presidential contender tries to get his endorsement and the media treats it like it‚Äôs a big ‚Äúget‚Äù rather than, say, something disqualifying. https://t.co/GF9grvGFN0YOU must establish a Congressional check against Trump, and WE do that by winning in November. Tweeting and Facebooking is good. Protesting is good. Donating is key. Making phone calls and door knocking is huge. Do what you can, and don‚Äôt assume anyone else has got this for you.Yes. Among many other things we need congressional oversight. https://t.co/DRkAbHyZK6There is zero evidence that the full resources of the federal government are being devoted to reuniting these children with their parents, and there is at least some evidence to the contrary.It doesn‚Äôt have to be planned to be a distraction.There have been no pictures and no video and there has been no accounting for any of the girls that have been separated from their parents.Where are the girls?I‚Äôve been thinking about this jacket that FLOTUS was wearing and here‚Äôs the thing: Republicans are still trying to take away health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.@burgessev THREAD 1/78@burgessev How about tweets do you like tweets@Megmo808 Hey its me.@JHWeissmann I mean I love the Times I‚Äôm just a bit frustrated is all.I think Michelle Wolfe and Robert Deniro should resign as Chair and Vice Chair of the DNC - it‚Äôs becoming too much of a distraction.One side is separating children from their parents and putting them in cages but on the other hand some celebrities are using swear words. Both sides!The President signed a vague executive order today but this much is clear: CHILDREN ARE STILL SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS and the government doesn‚Äôt appear to be doing the first thing to reunite them.Only under Trump does moving from the mass separation of babies from parents to indefinite detention of families seem like an improvement.All it takes is one Republican to say ‚Äúon judges and executive confirmations I will vote with the Democrats until this policy is reversed.‚ÄùI am increasingly uneasy that there are no photographs released by DHS of any of the facilities for girls who have been separated from their parents. The American public deserves to know and see what‚Äôs happening to all of these children.Giving into extortion ensures that Trump will do it again and again, with more aggressive cruelty. If there‚Äôs an extremely narrow bill that‚Äôs fine, but once R‚Äôs say ‚Äúfix the broken immigration system‚Äù in this context, they are going to not fix it and try to get credit for trying. https://t.co/13vHmysq5LPlease keep calling! https://t.co/dcBXlKM7OuI would like for the next President to be in command of his or her emotions at least during work hours.I do not think the use of the word ‚Äúinfest‚Äù is a coincidence.They want you to be so afraid of other people that you don‚Äôt notice when they take away your health care.Just because the Trump administration is separating kids from their parents doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt also trying to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing health conditions.Our extremists want healthcare for everyone.@alliegoldenpen Hard no on that but thanks.If my Party ever gets hijacked by bigots and crackpots I will quit it.We have a real chance at building enough public pressure to stop this policy, either by getting POTUS to reverse, or passing legislation. So, raise your voices in every single way that you can. But make no mistake, we absolutely must win the November election, and we need you.This Monday is very racist.Just remember how the campaign started when you are evaluating whether or not to give these people the benefit of the doubt.This is a lot of words, and zero compassion.I am glad I voted against Secretary Nielson.Stephen Miller should do the briefing.All that is required to stop this madness is for one Republican Senator to use his or her extraordinary powers. With the Senate split 51-49, any Senator can literally change history. Senators have mounted blockades and filibusters for less urgent matters in the past.Today, more than ever, I am proud to be a member of the Democratic Party. We are deeply imperfect but we fight for the right things.Let me give you some advice if you are on the fence. Pick the kids. Always side with the kids.It appears that there may be more lying than usual next week.‚ÄúThis moral outrage is not about Party, it is about humanity. If this doesn‚Äôt get solved, I will quit the Republican Party.‚Äù - Imaginary Republican, June 17, 2018@ErickFernandez The bill you are referring to is not a compromise at all. I agree with you.I‚Äôm afraid we may get a bipartisan group to craft a compromise bill which the President kills with a tweet and we miss our opportunity to just ban this practice. So, let‚Äôs try to act quick - as if it were our children. Barring that let‚Äôs win the elections.Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all of the fathers and grandfathers out there. It is a good time to count our blessings and just be with our kids.*The above quotes are fictitious and no actual Republican said these things, but they should.‚ÄúIf they cannot solve this, I can no longer be a Republican. This is the last straw.‚Äù‚ÄúI do not want this to be my Party. Therefore, I will cosponsor Dianne Feinstein‚Äôs legislation, but I‚Äôm hoping we can solve this quicker by the President simply reversing this practice, which is totally within his authority.‚Äù‚ÄúEven though I believe in strong border security what the administration is doing to children and families is much more destabilizing than properly adjudicating these situations and providing resources to the border for the law to be administered humanely.‚Äù‚ÄúI am a conservative because I believe in family. And there‚Äôs nothing conservative about the policy of ripping children from their parents.‚ÄùI can think of something you could do for Father‚Äôs Day. https://t.co/v5x6pluytPIt should be pretty easy, politically and morally, to repudiate this guy. https://t.co/SwcK5NJnbXWe need 60. https://t.co/AswSd9zgUb@ChrisMurphyCT It was a nice double I just wanted to see video proof.Is it just me or is this week feeling super racist and terrible?Every Democrat would vote yes on keeping families together and ending the barbarism and cruelty being conducted by our government. The question for next week is whether the R‚Äôs are willing to serve as a check on Trump.If on Sunday a centrist pundit explains to me how ripping babies from their moms is a good midterm strategy I might break my TV.@ErikLoomis @jonathanchait @NYMag Agree. I don‚Äôt see why we should spill much ink on this issue, or why these kids are being treated as leaders of left-wing activism. There‚Äôs so much good, smart, aggressive progressivism out there. That‚Äôs todays left - it‚Äôs actually the biggest grassroots movement in generations!@jonathanchait Hey I don‚Äôt have that rule.@ErikLoomis @jonathanchait I like Chait and his work. I loved his book about Obama, and his @NYMag pieces. I wasn‚Äôt calling him out - I was asking him how big of a problem this is relative to other stuff facing society. Which is neither a condemnation of his view nor a ‚Äúnever criticize the left rule.‚Äù@ChrisMurphyCT @nielslesniewski @ChrisVanHollen I am impressed.üò≥ https://t.co/vwFhxqo5m4While it is true that Trump said this, what he said is not true. As a result of this tweet, his untruth will be spread more rapidly across the country, which I don‚Äôt think is the goal here. This really allows an esteemed news organization to be an effective vessel for lies. https://t.co/j4J7CgxagMJust so we‚Äôre clear the House immigration proposal which they characterize as a ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù is a compromise between Republican factions with no Democrats involved. In fact it is a matter of principle that these negotiations were only among Republicans. So, not a compromise.@nielslesniewski @ChrisMurphyCT Is there video I don‚Äôt believe that.Damnit. They are babies. Have some humanity.This can sound complicated so it‚Äôs essential that we keep this simple and precise. This does NOT need to be part of a big legislative package that has no chance of being enacted. And the only reason to argue for that is to use children as POLITICAL LEVERAGE. https://t.co/pMs1rULjrHIf you are outraged, disgusted, sad, appalled, in disbelief, angry at what the government is doing the most important thing you can do is call your member of Congress. https://t.co/rg35HVAXg8Stop pretending that banning the separation of children from parents is complex legislation. It‚Äôs ONE LINE, and it could pass ‚Äúon suspension‚Äù in the House on Monday, and by Unanimous Consent in the Senate on Tuesday. Attaching it to a bigger immigration bill is killing it.@NateSilver538 One can think it‚Äôs not a zero sum game and still think we got rolled.@oandsometimesy We pay our interns but it‚Äôs not universal.A small but significant bit of progress in the appropriations bill today -money and language to pay interns. We should pay interns.I‚Äôm not trying to be gratuitous or unfair but isn‚Äôt saluting a General from an enemy military sort of a big deal?These kids did nothing wrong. And anyone with a family - anyone with a conscience - any religious person - knows that what our government is doing is a wrong of historic proportions. There must be a unanimous outrage that resounds across the country and transcends politics.If you are not for Corey Stewart you should say so. If you are not for separating kids from their families you should join the Feinstein legislation. If you are not for tariffs against Canada you should join the Corker bill. The time to stand up for American values is right now.Hey if any Republican is uncomfortable with an explicit threat from the national party Chair feel free to join a temporary alliance with the Dems to save the country and we can go back to fighting each other later.Mayor Bernard is tall. https://t.co/p4z2AGVzYtThe first amendment is great. Democracy is great. Neo-Nazis are terrible. Autocrats are not our friends. Canada is. Please vote for Democrats.This is simply not true and the Associated Press is not obligated to carry an untrue statement far and wide even if it is made by the President. https://t.co/vYEzfjQZJ6North Korea is still a nuclear threat. Children should not be separated from their parents. Everyone likes net neutrality except congressional Republicans. Where medical marijuana is available, opioid use goes down. VOTE!They aren‚Äôt games. https://t.co/pXpzMQtKaKBecause Canada is one of our closest allies and because tariffs are taxes that American consumers and businesses pay, I am a cosponsor with @SenBobCorker to make sure that POTUS cannot start a trade war by fiat. It deserves an up or down vote, and if it gets a vote, it will win.Lotta economic anxiety among VA GOP voters I guess.So, don‚Äôt give up hope. These past few days have been especially alarming and nuts but we can fix it in November if we work hard and stick together. https://t.co/OzOqtbDhVSI mean to be fair it was impossible to see any of this coming.I promise not to do this too often but this is a MUST WATCH. https://t.co/oIoeRfDuOvIf you are pregnant, mentally ill, have cancer, a bad knee, asthma, diabetes, sleep apnea, acne, lupus or any other pre-existing condition, please be aware that the Republicans are trying to allow insurance companies to jack up your rates or not give you coverage at all.Whatever your view of North Korea - remember that the Republicans are actively trying to take away protections for 52 million Americans with pre-existing health conditions.Today is a good day to figure out who is with Trump no matter what.This is an abdication of American leadership. Just embarrassing. https://t.co/G6uCVSvj2EWhat did we get? Do we get something later? Because it looks like KJU got all the stuff. Does our stuff get announced in a few months?In less than a week President Trump has turned our relationship with the western world upside down, and he developed what appeared to be a true friendship with one of cruelest despots on the planet. ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù is undermining our values and our interests.There is a petition circulating in the House of Representatives to allow a floor vote to save #Netneutrality . It‚Äôs got around 170 signatures and we need another 48. We won the Senate vote, now we have to get signatures in the House so we can restore #netneutrality. Please help!There is only one way to get Congress to act like a co-equal branch of government. We have to win in November.Between control over the schedule, subpoena power, and the power of the purse, and especially with the Senate divided 51-49, any Republican wanting to more than express reservations - to slow or stop the madness -could do so. This person would be an actual hero in my estimation.R‚Äôs control the calendar as it relates to appointments. So if they wanted to push back on what Trump is doing, they could make life near impossible. This is one point of leverage - check of the legislative branch against executive power, but they are not using it at all.R‚Äôs have chairmanships. That means only they can call hearings, subpoena witnesses, and dictate the terms of debate. This is normally used for oversight - to guide the administration and hold them accountable. Little to none of that is happening under total Republican control.@SusanFr6 Elections.Republicans are letting a Republican President overturn decades of bipartisan American foreign policy via a rolling, extemporaneous series of grievances because tax cuts.Republicans could put a stop to this but they won‚Äôt. Every conversation about today‚Äôs politics starts and ends with that.I like America being friends with the good guys. I like us being the good guys.I would like for the next President to emotionally mature enough to handle a meeting with a bunch of big deal people without spinning out of control.! https://t.co/JAMtaAOVK8This is outstanding. https://t.co/3iZ0QFnTfxThis isn‚Äôt some political shouting match. They really are coming after you and your healthcare. And they will be stopped if we win, but they will most certainly go through with it if we lose. https://t.co/eoAdPKKiu3Whatever your political party or your views on the size of government or social issues or foreign policy or Roseanne or the NFL, if you are one of 52 million Americans with a pre-existing health condition, I encourage you to vote for Democrats this year to save your healthcare .Leaders lead. https://t.co/cB52NnQKCJIf you or a family member have asthma , or mental illness, or heart disease, or chronic back pain, or a bad hip, or whatever, you should be angry. R‚Äôs and Team Trump are trying to take away your coverage by gutting the law that protects you. Vote them out. Spread the word.I know this doesn‚Äôt get the clicks. But it is in fact more important than anything. https://t.co/5UfLpfgYdqMental illness is just illness. Mental health is just health. Tens of millions of people in America experience mental illness. Please make sure you get the help you need - treatment works.R‚Äôs going after the most popular part of ACA. They are fighting in court to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Everyone who fought for healthcare in 2017 has got to be fully mobilized for this election.Donald Trump is angering our friends around the globe and kissing up to our enemies. This isn‚Äôt just a different tactical approach - it is an attempt to upend the world order led by America and it is as dangerous as anything we‚Äôve seen since the election.THREAD. https://t.co/g8526nIDo4Yeah but something something pledge of allegiance MS13 Pelosi Obama isis Ebola. https://t.co/Sp1irKepNEI‚Äôm glad we are doing diplomacy. This is better than war. But we need to do it well, and we need to resist the temptation to render judgement next week either based on limited information or our own partisan disposition. (End)I also worry that we are misreading what China wants to do here. Of course they don‚Äôt want chaos on their border, but they probably don‚Äôt mind if we are, through or recklessness, fraying our friendships and alliances with South Korea, Japan, and others. They won‚Äôt bail us out.No one wants to use the word ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù because it sounds insufficiently tough, but once DPRK could reach the US mainland, this is where we are. This is a bad approach. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs better than war on the Korean Peninsula.The idea that we can intervene either diplomatically or militarily to get DPRK to change its mind about their nuclear program is based on a fantasy. Or worse, it‚Äôs being propagated who want diplomacy to fail in order to advocate for war.The President‚Äôs overconfidence and lack of preparation may not backfire immediately, but it must be managed but the State Department team.Denuclearization of North Korea is not at all realistic, so it‚Äôs essential that we go into these talks with reasonable expectations, and with great suspicion. Success, in my mind, would be a lack of gaffes or verbal hostility, and an agreement to keep talking.One new scandal about Scott Pruitt is that he‚Äôs poisoning the air and the water.This is reassuring for the western democratic world order and depressing for America‚Äôs role in it. https://t.co/5sjRdCVLE1There is no way the Senate would confirm someone so unqualified ACTUALLY NEVER MIND THEY WOULD DO IT.

It‚Äôs just been a couple of hours so just checking in.There is no Mueller report yet, so he doesn‚Äôt know this at all. I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised, but I am surprised, at how quickly the Republican Party abandoned the rule of law. Letting Mueller do his job is not exactly asking for a profile in courage. https://t.co/R2Gq1Q6IZn@christineahn @NickKristof No worries.I think maybe they are keeping Scott Pruitt specifically to move the line on what constitutes a firing offense.I mean, it‚Äôs literally the job of POTUS to be leader of the free world and it is beyond strange that it makes him grouchy to do meetings with our strongest allies.@christineahn @NickKristof I didn‚Äôt sign that letter.@GothamGirlBlue We are not at all in danger of being hijacked by someone like Trump.@plawler Right but I can see how that‚Äôs insulting and contrary to small d democratic principles.@ZacAKAMadu I am not arguing that superdelegates have ever exercised their ability to override the vote, just that this possibility makes a significant chunk of our coalition angry. So, we should dump the whole thing and move on.@KaivanShroff I think we should have primaries, not caucuses, because working people who don‚Äôt control their own schedule find it harder to vote in caucuses. We spend a lot of effort making it easier to vote in Generals, but caucuses make it hard for some.@kylekennedycopy They haven‚Äôt but the possibility that it could‚Äôve happened made everyone angry and it‚Äôs not worth whatever theoretical upside may have existed previously.We should get rid of superdelegates or at least make it so they can‚Äôt override the will of the voters.Republicans own this dude. https://t.co/080Tc1SSnCRudy Giuliani is a terrible Secretary of State.This would be hilarious if it were not terrifying and sad. https://t.co/ruCxpWcMX7Pretending that getting steel from Canada presents a national security problem is an unforced error, a deep insult, and has no basis in fact.

One benefitted from polarization and the other did not. https://t.co/nceoSxompBIt is better to do diplomacy badly than to do war badly but this is still not going well.I am all for diplomacy but we don‚Äôt have to give away so much for so little.@KevinMKruse @scottlincicome I‚Äôm happy that people like it.Seems like a lot more people take ambien than I thought.@danksterdrew I just finished a thing and walking to the car. Tweeting doesn‚Äôt take too much time!I think next week is the week that Republicans finally stand up to Donald Trump in Congress and reassert the separation of powers and the rule of law. I‚Äôm totally kidding we have to vote them out.I am outraged that so many people died in Puerto Rico. I am outraged that the government is separating children from parents. I am outraged that R‚Äôs are driving healthcare costs up. I am generally not outraged at what celebrities say, even when it‚Äôs outrageous.What this whole Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza thing shows us is that the tax cuts generated no additional economic growth, and were basically a giveaway to the wealthiest corporations in human history.@tinyfingresist Under no circumstances.Trump is systematically undermining our leadership in the world. Even if you don‚Äôt love the Democrats  - this country needs an institutional check against one party rule.To get in a fight with Canada requires a special kind of whatever the opposite of talent is.@AlexLealWrites This is fair.I‚Äôm not usually one of these ‚Äúthis is a distraction‚Äù people but I‚Äôm pretty sure that talking about Roseanne, Kim K, and Samantha Bee is just not gonna win us any votes anywhere. None of this ends unless we win in November. Let‚Äôs win in November.One final thought about Roseanne is that we just expanded Medicaid in Virginia so we should talk about that a ton.They say MS13 but they really mean anyone who doesn‚Äôt look like them. https://t.co/njCAp4uBatOne more thought on Roseanne: Republican sabotage is causing the price of healthcare to skyrocket this year.My view of the Roseanne issue is that climate change is real, caused by humans, urgent, and solvable.Near Leilani Estates this morning. https://t.co/bSgcPKLu3lMadam Pele. https://t.co/kgiEAunguUPuna Geothermal Venture. https://t.co/LJ6LmtFoDXMadam Pele today. https://t.co/7ODTqi444xMy view today.
