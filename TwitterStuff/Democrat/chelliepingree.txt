So I ask that we put our money where our mouths are with this #FarmBill and vote down this partisan legislation that will hurt farmers in states like #Maine. #mepolitics https://t.co/Dt35UJ8l8mBy eliminating mandatory funding for programs that invest directly in farmers‚Äîfor value-added production, energy efficiency, organic certification, local food promotion &amp; more--the #GOPFarmBill makes it harder for them to succeed. #mepoliticsOver the next five years, consumers will continue to change our food system. The question is if #farmers like Josh will be able to capitalize on the opportunity. #mepoliticsJosh uses the #organic cost-share program to help cover the costs of certification, which helps him get more for his product.

Read my letter to the editor of the @PressHerald #mepolitics https://t.co/9UQD1o2yZpI‚Äôve supported concrete and comprehensive proposals to bring Rx drug costs down. If President Trump really wants to make a difference, he‚Äôll show his support for these proposals next week.We can‚Äôt understate this crisis. As Rx drug costs continue to grow, millions of people face a choice between their health and their financial security ‚Äì a choice that‚Äôs been exacerbated by Republicans‚Äô constant efforts to undermine the #ACA and drive up out-of-pocket costs.States across the country, most recently including Maine, have taken steps to clarify what exactly goes into drug pricing decisions by manufacturers. We should be taking those steps on the federal side, too.The drug pricing issue is complicated, and we know that a lot of different factors contribute to high costs for consumers. That‚Äôs why we should also be focusing on transparency.Read the bill here: https://t.co/IyjTpHOloDI'm the lead sponsor of the bipartisan Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act (H.R.1480). @SenJohnMcCain has introduced a companion bill (S.64) in the Senate. Our bills would allow individuals to import a 90-day supply of most medications from approved Canadian pharmacies.I‚Äôve led groups of Maine seniors on trips to licensed Canadian pharmacies, which often resulted in hundreds of savings each month. Now, years later, many Rx drugs in Canada still remain a fraction of the cost of their U.S. equivalent‚Äì in part b/c of their ability to negotiate.In Congress, I‚Äôve supported similar approaches allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices under Medicare Part D. I believe these market-based solutions could go a long way toward lowering overall health care costs in this country and ensuring access to care.The Maine Rx Program was challenged by drug companies through the courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it was upheld in Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644 (2003).Next wk, @realDonaldTrump plans to make a speech about Rx drug costs. I‚Äôve been working on this issue for nearly two decades + have some ideas for him. In the Maine Senate, I introduced a bill creating the Maine Rx program, which gave the state purchasing power to lower Rx costs. https://t.co/qZUORkhXmpGreat news!
