Met so many wonderful hardworking Missourians at Mid Continent yesterday. These tariffs are putting them out of business and chasing their customers to the Chinese Cheaters. Makes no sense. Trying to help. https://t.co/SKlkU4ri2HToday: Arnold, Cape, Bernie, Dexter. 
Monday: Rolla, Washington, Sunset Hills, St Charles
Tuesday: Arch Grand Opening, Ellisville, Troy, Warrenton. 
Wed : Webster 4th of July parade and then cooking big 4th feed for very large family! (26 of us üòç)Glad we had a #TeamClaire in the house for ‚Å¶@Tsunamy27‚Å© charity bowling tournament in St Peters tonight. He does so much for so many with his ‚Å¶@tsunami_waves‚Å© foundation. https://t.co/MONUHQxcsMYes! More needed but our bill is a good first step. https://t.co/m8Gux5wRIlWhy does this sound vaguely familiar? https://t.co/YYsLNnymrIMy thanks to @Sen_JoeManchin. And a sore rib for a few weeks is no big deal. I play hurt. The work goes on. https://t.co/rBb0gBq32FJosh Hawley used Missouri taxpayer money to file this lawsuit to eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions. Seriously. Bad. https://t.co/31dj0ae0ACFighting for jobs in Poplar Bluff. These tariffs are not well thought out. Go after cheaters, not Missouri jobs.  https://t.co/IB6oL3qahgWhat she said. https://t.co/VwrQ9hWgofAnd this shows extreme pain from trade war to our number 1 crop, soybeans.  https://t.co/ZrzKPymca6Trade war is hurting our state. And this isn‚Äôt even counting the severe damage to Missouri agriculture. https://t.co/TIM93Xqb7k@nealcarter I am joining the legislation tomorrow and am working on other ways to help end this policy and hold the administration accountable.Yes. I will be on the bill and will be doing more follow up work with CPB and HHS as ranking member on Homeland Security Committee. https://t.co/XZ6KTkQgnBTo assert that you must rip children from their family to secure the border is just not true.I will be joining this bill next week to stop this outrageous administration policy and following up on my longstanding work on the failure of HHS  to adequately care for these children. https://t.co/UZ87rNi2QwWe should never forget the dangers our brave law enforcement officers face every day. Thinking of their families tonight. https://t.co/bDCQAxl3KhProductive day today. 8 of my bills moved out of committee with  big bipartisan support. (4 of mine and 4 where I was D lead sponsor). Good stuff on detecting fentanyl in the mail, protecting rural post offices, going after improper payments, and cutting govt waste. https://t.co/ZVUUib6mC0And this. Why risk retaliation to Missouri Ag and claim that Canada is a threat to national security? Go after China cheaters! https://t.co/y1tOray7QRThis. https://t.co/3QD4HtvSJEPart of this trade surplus is our exports from Missouri farmers. Canada is the number one export market for Missouri‚Äôs Ag commodities. https://t.co/Pg3PgdOggnJust. That. Simple. https://t.co/HzCkiU8ZDuThese wonderful folks don‚Äôt agree with @HawleyMO that their 4 year college degree is worthless. Thank you Lincoln alums for your gracious invitation to speak Sat night in KC. https://t.co/MzKZchuqkXGoodness gracious. Talk about a turn out! NW Mo Democrats are serious about this election. Everyone wants to make a difference. And you can! Volunteer. Please! https://t.co/FrfkCPkyVy https://t.co/Lw5OKIrxkmPrivileged to honor thousands  who were participating in 5K this am at Arrowhead to support ‚Å¶@ShatterproofHQ‚Å©  This organization supports those in recovery with evidence based treatment/prevention/research.

Thanks!@democratmo Thank you Jeffrey!Congratulations Senator Arthur! It‚Äôs a flip...red to blue. Thanks to all the hard work of Lauren and many volunteers we have won a state senate seat that Trump won and was held by a Republican. By a lot!! Not even close....I agree with my Republican colleagues from Iowa. This administration is hurting the renewable fuel industry and catering to Big Oil. That is devastating  to Mo farmers and our renewable fuel industry.   https://t.co/QSuV8SUgsV https://t.co/pCpLULBi8D@KCMikeMahoney @ruckin_ Looking for a pay phone or gas station to ask for directions when I couldn‚Äôt find a map in the car.I am so grateful to the hundreds of volunteers who turned out today all over the state. This race will not be won on TV. It will be won with people to people contact. Let‚Äôs do this thing together! #TeamClaire üíôüíô https://t.co/p4ScjpFI4mGreat to be there @SenatorNasheed ! https://t.co/ZK2CHMIJ9GThe subpoena excuse is close to the dog ate my homework. Totally bogus. Does the AG‚Äôs office expect people to believe that a private lawyer has more power than the Atty General? Embarrassing.That‚Äôs what happens when you don‚Äôt actually investigate. An investigation isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthey told us they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong‚Äù AG should have filed suit under 610.027 like the private lawyer who found this out today. Embarrassing that private atty has to do AG‚Äôs job. #ladders https://t.co/mEm9wKQiHDHappy to help! Now you can pull your rabbit out of your hat without a dumb federal regulation getting in your way! https://t.co/HG80Fol7WpTotally bogus excuse that he couldn‚Äôt subpoena. He could have done exactly what this private attorney did and gotten the information he claims he couldn‚Äôt get.That statute SPECIFICALLY gives the Attorney General the right to bring suit but he refused and this private citizen is doing his job for him. Not good.RsMO 610.027 https://t.co/JgtHRt549IAnd more important than üí∞is volunteers! Massive voter contact starts tomorrow. Here is list of offices that are already open. We‚Äôd love to see you there in the morning. https://t.co/LWPUXnz4RbSpeaking of BigBlue....gas money anyone? https://t.co/GDwHm709Mc.

Holy Cow. https://t.co/ym6sw4tURQSo predictable. I feel for Ambassador  Haley. She is strong, smart, and capable. And the WH threw her under the bus. I‚Äôd be furious.  https://t.co/YKBNKlSVALPrayers and sympathy for the Bush family. She was a wonderful woman. https://t.co/JSNAXbEiVZBeing dependent on multimillion dollar donors is part of the evil that Citizen United has caused.

What in the world is going on? https://t.co/lHUIFrZdnBI have read the official report from the Republican led Missouri House investigation, including the sworn testimony. It is clearly time to put the interests of the people of Missouri first. The Governor should resign.I can‚Äôt get my head around a man‚Äôs character that would put his wife and children through this kind of pain.It was a long tough fight. But we never gave up. My thanks to my partner @SenRobPortman. Unfortunate the WH played politics with the bill signing. But most impt? The courage of the survivors and their families.  https://t.co/0dv6umuXgcOur investigation. Oversight matters. https://t.co/370HzRzMjuOur pleasure.

Senate passed 98-3 on July 27, 2017

Trump signed on Aug 2, 2017              
Trump ignores and violates our Constitution on January30,2018 https://t.co/4SyzLNgdacCongress voted 517-5 to impose sanctions on Russia. The President decides to ignore that law. Folks that is a constitutional crisis. There should be outrage in every corner of this country.We‚Äôve made some progress in expediting competitive generic approval.

Never.Remember when the refrain was a constant ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the budget?‚Äù a few years ago? Well we have no budget. It was due last spring. We have had 4 CRs in 5 months! (continuing resolutions that are only temp patches for the govt to operate) And one party is completely in charge.Compromise is the essence of democracy.

They both agreed to lower taxes on the wealthiest....lower than either of their previous versions. JeezLouise.  #taxscamSo there‚Äôs no misunderstanding, the negotiations on tax bill that are being talked about at WH  right now are negotiations between Republicans. No Democrats allowed. We have no idea what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs a shame. Coulda been different.Thank you Alabama!Nope. I agree. Maybe 1.5. But I agree. https://t.co/ilWNxDhthGOh. My. Goodness.

The added complexity is a playground for legal tax avoidance. This does not level the playing field. Not simpler. Not fairer. https://t.co/5TeNT12E6xAl Franken should resign.I agree! https://t.co/oAdf5yJTpnThis is a really good question.

What could go wrong?What he said. https://t.co/SB9lV8YrYXRemember this? Read the bill. Can we have till tomorrow morning to read this @SenateMajLdr ? Please?No. It‚Äôs. Not. These are the amendments they are stuffing in the bill that we will be asked to vote on in a few hours. Without time for us to read or ask questions. I can assure you the process is not working. https://t.co/ZEOVaPGGYiThis is so bad. We have just gotten list of amendments to be included in bill NOT from our R colleagues, but from lobbyists downtown. None of us have seen this list, but lobbyists have it. Need I say more? Disgusting. And we probably will not even be given time to read them. https://t.co/Mn0i56JeZg
