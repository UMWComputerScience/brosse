Hi Curt. Good to hear from you. Can we have our $75 million back? https://t.co/WkWqSg0wnsFirst Sergeant Peter Andrew McKenna, Jr., is a national hero. I’m proud that the Senate passed my bill to honor him last night. Thank you to @SenJackReed and @SenWhitehouse for helping ensure it moved quickly. Will soon be signed into law. https://t.co/Z9AQRieJs9We have a President who calls the media “the enemy of the people.”

We have a Congress that refuses to prevent gun violence. 

This madness has to end.Multiple fatalities at a newspaper in Annapolis. 

No, Republicans are not going to have a hearing on this in Congress.

The Judiciary Committee did have a hearing on @HillaryClinton’s emails today. Because apparently that’s still more of a priority than preventing gun violence.Proud to announce the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act to protect the right of working people to form a union. Click here to watch my remarks from today’s press conference. https://t.co/oPjaGCnwAW.@realDonaldTrump: NO COLLUSION!

MUELLER: https://t.co/E0mOxyfA6hCall me crazy, but I’m starting to think Trump isn’t tough on Russia. https://t.co/N9R7BpJ9ebThis is an important step in improving Poland’s Holocaust denial law, which @RepRoKhanna and I opposed in a letter in April. I look forward to continuing the dialogue with Poland to ensure we have an honest discussion about Holocaust revisionism.
https://t.co/FPDeD7vyNtClean air and safe drinking water will be on the ballot.LGBT rights will be on the ballot.Access to quality, affordable health care will be on the ballot.Roe v. Wade will be on the ballot.If the Senate doesn’t do that, the American people will be able to make their voices heard this November....I believe the Senate should wait until after the midterms to consider Justice Kennedy's replacement. The American people deserve to have a voice in this process.In light of the serious allegations of corruption that have been raised against the President, the ongoing Special Counsel investigation, and the standard Republicans set in 2016 when they denied Merrick Garland a single hearing on his Supreme Court nomination...This news could not be worse. Kennedy’s replacement could impact women’s reproductive health care, LGBT rights, and clean air protections. Elections have consequences. https://t.co/VcppJzRIsCWhere are the children?.@repjoecrowley has been an outstanding champion for working people. He showed tremendous class last night and reminded our party of the importance of coming together, and fighting together, to take back the House this November. I’m proud to call him my friend.Congratulations to @Ocasio2018 on her victory in New York last night. I’m sure that she’s going to hit the ground running next January!I heard that Bill Shine might be the next White House communications director, and it reminded me that @realDonaldTrump’s tax cuts for the wealthy aren’t working for working people. Harley Davidson is moving overseas anyways because of his stupid trade war.In this country, we should honor hard work with a decent wage. The American Dream was meant for all of us, not just the wealthy few. #UnionStrong #UnionProud https://t.co/s5vl2Au6qWUnions gave working people the weekend, fair labor conditions, decent pay, and employer-provided health insurance. They ended child labor and led the fight for family and medical leave. #UnionStrong #UnionProudHORRIBLE Supreme Court decision again today. When unions succeed, America succeeds. #UnionStrong #UnionProudAs @RepMattGaetz knows, but refuses to admit, Vladimir Putin ordered a disinformation campaign with the goal of electing @realDonaldTrump President. That’s a fact. https://t.co/h5ZsQlOWiDOne final point. Justice Gorsuch was the deciding vote today. Remember that. Roe v Wade could very well be on the ballot this fall.This is a terrible decision. Future generations are going to wonder what the hell happened to our country.The conservative majority on the Supreme Court ignored the President’s clear, expressed intention to block Muslims from coming to the United States. 

The Muslim Ban is a bad policy. It’s un-American. It’s not who we are.Yes. This bill allows them to report positive information about consumers. Right now, they only report negative info to credit agencies. https://t.co/sswl4x8GiPTonight, the House passed two bipartisan bills I co-sponsored. One to give Navy vets access to care for Agent Orange exposure, and another to give better credit scores to consumers who pay their utility bills on time.Officially filed my candidacy for re-election earlier today. Looking forward to talking more in the weeks ahead about the issues facing Rhode Island and our country. https://t.co/1GbFaOP11vIn the last five years, Republican politicians have tried to make it harder for working people to vote. Gerrymandering, voter ID, voter purges, and attacks on early voting are threats to our democracy. #RestoreTheVOTEWatch what this President DOES, not what he SAYS. https://t.co/BS5dY5mMueAnother thing the President isn’t talking about this morning’s Twitter Distract-A-Thon...how to make sure working people can succeed as automation advances. https://t.co/LhwBlDRN7YFolks, there are children being held in cages on the US-Mexico border. Don’t let him change the subject. https://t.co/wQJzFDxe8ZAnother point I’d like to make about the President’s constant use of Twitter is that Republicans are trying to take away health care from millions of Americans.Literally none of this is true. https://t.co/6TNuFWY23B“These people...invade our Country...no Judges or Court Cases.”

When someone talks like a racist and says they want to get rid of judges, courts, and due process, you should believe them. https://t.co/4A6H3Z0jgCAnother thing that you might not know about @PressSec being denied service at a restaurant is that Republicans want to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for tax cuts for corporations.I am so grateful for the many eloquent religious leaders of different faiths who have raised their voices and strongly condemned the barbaric practice of separating young children from their parents.@brian_bass Thanks, Brian.@linwoodchu @nuestrasalud @KaraAFoley @GabiDomenzain @RepCicilline @SEMarkey @rdrigopimentel @gwaynemiller Thanks, Katy.@BigOrangeAlum Thanks, Lynn.Getting ready to join @CNNSitRoom with @wolfblitzer.

He created this crisis with his ‘zero tolerance’ policy that treats asylum seekers as criminals.This is pathetic. Apparently the President is fine to keep immigrant families together as long as he can keep them behind bars indefinitely.Just reached out to Stephen Miller to share my thoughts on the President’s cruel policy of separating families at the border. Hope he gets back to me... #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/aslCdCELAVI hope this is true. We’ve all learned to focus on what the President DOES not what he SAYS.  And what’s his plan for reuniting the kids...? https://t.co/vbHvbteBmzPress conference outside the Capitol. We are not going to stop fighting until @realDonaldTrump ends this cruel family separation policy! #NotInMyName #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/6uOX334giN@victoriacriado @realDonaldTrump Will do!  Nice to hear from you, Victoria!@patrams11 @kylegriffin1 @OrganizeRI @POTUS @SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse @JimLangevin Current law DOES NOT require family separations that are occurring.  President can change this with a phone call. No change in law necessary. He created this crisis by his action, he can immediately reverse it.@aceoforder @realDonaldTrump Sadly they do not seem so horrified but my hope is that they will hear from their constituents and feel compelled to act.Secretary Nielsen needs to resign. She has the power to stop this cruel policy. She lied about it consistently over the past few days. I’ve seen the these kids in custody and spoken to their crying mothers. Any judgment that this policy makes sense is seriously flawed.Back in DC for a Judiciary Committee hearing on...Hillary’s emails. 

GOP doesn’t want to talk about family separation, reducing gun violence, or corruption in the Trump administration.

Hillary Clinton’s emails. 

It’s INSANE..@realDonaldTrump, for the record, I’ve heard from 263 constituents so far about your family separation policy. 

None of them support it.@ywca_ri Thanks for being there, Joyce!@GrayGeek401 @ljargo1 Thanks, also.@katecoynemccoy Just help keep the pressure on the Administration to change this policy.  As President Lincoln said “public sentiment is everything!’  We can’t let up until the barbaric policy is stopped.@ljargo1 Thanks!Just getting back to Rhode Island now. The images of asylum seekers wearing prison jumpsuits and of innocent children crowded together in cages are still fresh in my mind. 

This is a fight worth having. The President’s cruel policy does not represent the values of our country.They did the same thing to Democratic members of Congress, and even told us to stop filming OUTSIDE facilities on multiple occasions. https://t.co/XQQfoFQ6NB@RIChapterWMW @m4RjRI I’m back in DC on Wednesday but thanks for doing this. We must all demand this barbaric practice end!!@lisa_narciso Thanks, Lisa.Thank you, @LauraWBush for your eloquent and powerful words. https://t.co/DQIx14GQwMJust left Port Isabel ICE Detention facility.

Tried to shoot a quick video (from the parking lot) to share what I saw inside, but once again ICE shut us down. https://t.co/O5MeukfhEkWalking out of Brownsville Children’s Shelter after DHS said they wouldn’t allow us to film on the sidewalk outside. https://t.co/BshFfxazG5@anonemus1 Asked Administrator to provide that information. He claimed they are protective of location facilities where young children &amp; girls are. I pressed him why they were more forthcoming on facilities w/ boys. Did not have an answer. We’ll follow up w/ formal request for this info.@brucetodesco @EasyMode243 I agree. There are current facility regulations applicable to all visitors that prohibit this. My guess is initially they were promulgated based on safety considerations.  Same rules that have been in place in most detention facilities I’ve visited.https://t.co/gAwf5mPXen.@secnielsen, this isn’t true. I just met with officials at Border Patrol Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, who told me 1,147 children have been separated from parents at their facility. https://t.co/1Z5WXMClbJAlso, doesn’t seem asylum requests are being handled correctly. 

Many people fleeing threats of violence are being prosecuted instead of having asylum request heard.

It’s our job.

But Republican Chairman @RepGoodlatte has held no hearings on the President’s cruel family separation policy. Republicans have no interest in doing their job.

It’s just wrong.Republicans are doing no oversight of the President’s family separation policy. It’s outrageous.

I’m going to Texas tmrw with @SenJeffMerkley, @ChrisVanHollen, @PeterWelch, @RepFilemonVela, @repmarkpocan, @RepGonzalez, and @JacksonLeeTX18 to do our own investigation.

But sure, @EnergzdEconomy, don’t apologize or delete the Tweet. Just another sign of the nasty times we live in where truth and facts don’t matter. https://t.co/A1Hng8oJNII’ve spent time with our troops in South Korea. They are incredibly brave men and women.

He is a mass murderer. One of the cruelest rulers on earth. A total psychopath.

Please stop embarrassing our country.

Really important that we address the recent spike in suicide rates and ensure those who need help can get it. https://t.co/m7fDDhp6pHCall me old-fashioned, but I miss having a President who worked with our allies instead of bro’ing out with dictators.Not much new in the deal Trump and Kim signed. Trump gave Kim a great photo op and agreed to suspend our joint military exercises with South Korea. He got:

•No specifics on denuclearization 
•Nothing on human rights 
•Nothing on ending North Korea’s cyberattacksMy full statement on #TrumpKimSummit #SingaporeSummit⁠⁠. 

It’s critical that the President reach an agreement that ends with Kim Jong Un giving up his nuclear weapons. https://t.co/J1UtoACzrE@JonLifeRI Of course.@JonLifeRI Please read my full statement.  Hopefully you will no longer think I’ve lost my senses.However, a deal that leaves North Korea with nuclear weapons capabilities is no deal at all, and the President must be willing to walk away if necessary.I hope that the President will be able to achieve an agreement that will lead to a safer, more peaceful world for all Americans.The President decided to hold this summit without meaningful concessions from the North Korean regime, giving Kim Jong Un a huge propaganda victory, so far with nothing in return.Our commitment to our allies – South Korea, Japan, and others in the region – must be clear and unwavering.Finally, any agreement must be achieved within the context of the United States’ continued support for our regional allies, who face the most immediate threat from North Korean aggression.These attacks are a growing threat to the world. If North Korea wants to come in from the cold, they cannot continue these aggressive activities.Last year, they used ransomware to attack more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, causing as much as $4 billion in lost economic activity.Third, North Korea continues to pose an urgent threat to our country in the field of cyberspace. Nearly four years ago, they hacked and released private messages between employees at Sony Pictures.The United States cannot normalize relations with a government that systemically starves, tortures, and brutalizes its own people.Pregnant women are violently forced to have abortions by having motor oil injected into their wombs.People are tortured for their religious faith.There are as many as 130,000 people languishing in North Korea’s gulags today.Second, any agreement should include a framework for punishing North Korea for its widespread human rights abuses and ultimately bringing them to an end.We cannot continue to live under the shadow of a nuclear threat from North Korea.Any agreement must include strong provisions for weapons inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to have full access to ensure North Korea’s compliance. North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a grave threat to the United States.First, the President needs to negotiate an agreement that results in North Korea giving up their nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs.It’s critical that the President succeed in advancing our national security goals and not hand the North Koreans huge, one-sided concessions just so he can say he got a deal.The North Korean regime is one of the most brutal on the face of the earth. They have repeatedly promised to destroy the United States and our allies with nuclear weapons.(Thread) Like all Americans, I hope that the President’s meeting with Kim Jong Un tonight proves successful.Getting ready for today’s parade celebrating the Day of Portugal. https://t.co/cGT1WyHvItGreat event today to celebrate the completion of restoration work on the iconic Pomham Lighthouse in Riverside.

•Health care costs are spiking
•Our bridges and roads are crumbling 
•This President is making us weaker at home and less respected across the worldIt strains credulity to think there’s any purpose for these pardons other than to send a message to Michael Cohen and others.

Here’s a crazy idea, @SpeakerRyan, work with Dems to craft a bipartisan bill!Republicans just failed to pass the farm bill, which should be routine. They are incapable of governing.Another horrific shooting. This time at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. Praying for the victims and their families. And praying that my colleagues find the courage to stop this epidemic.Shameful that the US Senate approved Gina Haspel. The use of torture under George W. Bush is a dark chapter. We cannot simply forget.

Thank you to Rhode Island’s great Senators, @SenJackReed and @SenWhitehouse, for standing on the right side of history.Happy birthday to our effective, hard-working and visionary Governor @GinaRaimondo!No one talks about the Russia investigation more than @realDonaldTrump. That’s because he has no real accomplishments. https://t.co/gclFfta8FOI have to say, I knew the NRA was terrible. But I didn’t think they were used by the Kremlin to help @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/xDfeWVsvQs https://t.co/g5mIE8rNtlSomething to ponder tonight: 

What are the odds Michael “I miss you so much boss” Cohen pitched himself to Qatar without @realDonaldTrump’s approval?Great to see Senate pass resolution on #NetNeutrality. Your move, @SpeakerRyan.@DanMcGowan @CharlesRaymonde @RIKidsCount Congrats@CharlesRaymonde!! So proud of you!The violence needs to stop and both sides need to come back to the negotiating table.I have always been and continue to be a strong supporter of the state of Israel and of a peaceful two-state solution. I fear the events of the last few days have made achieving peace an even more elusive goal.Violence in Gaza over past few days is horrific. Israel has the right to defend itself but must adhere to international norms. The Trump administration’s reaction is not helping.Is anyone really shocked that we now have EVEN MORE proof that the Trump campaign was open to colluding with Putin’s Russia?Overdoses kill more Rhode Islanders each year than car crashes. Important that we end this crisis. Just met with the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force to discuss treatment strategies. https://t.co/kDcRRmJmc4NEW: @RepJerryNadler, @RepCummings, @GerryConnolly, and I are once again requesting the White House’s communications with DOJ on @ATT. Need to know if @POTUS inappropriately interfered in investigation. https://t.co/FLFxAzrz2eJohn Barron/John Miller is not going to put up with these leaks! https://t.co/FdIdknJIm5@Foustart @NanasabraSabra I will let her know that.  She’ll love hearing it!  Hope you’re well.@Choose2BCurious @RadioArlington @CentralFalls_RI My pleasure!So grateful today for my wonderful mom, @NanasabraSabra. She taught me right from wrong, instilled in me the importance of service, and always made sure my four siblings and I knew we were loved unconditionally.  

Happy Mother’s Day, Mom! https://t.co/v4jFLs6qW2Two days later, still a lot of questions but few answers on @ATT. https://t.co/JOSJtLSgJlProfiles in courage. https://t.co/zHyf8LamUA.@MichaelAvenatti has revealed more about the corruption in @realDonaldTrump’s inner circle over the last week than Republicans in Congress did over the last year.As usual, @JoeBiden is right. https://t.co/8tvB9iEc3LWow. AG Sessions refused to answer this when I asked him under oath last November. https://t.co/NQ17eFhMqJ https://t.co/hzrqUiLc3EIf you were upset about @michelleisawolf a few weeks ago, you can’t be defending @kellysadler45 tonight.These people have no shame. It really is @realDonaldTrump’s Republican Party now. https://t.co/C9Ts1csnoVWhen our allies can no longer rely on us, it hurts our own security. https://t.co/vZmh5LqXbbAnother @realDonaldTrump failure. America deserves #ABetterDeal. https://t.co/pFrSUEpx6jNEW: My letter with Senator @amyklobuchar on @ATT’s reported payments to President @realDonaldTrump’s personal lawyer. https://t.co/22hVNq9PfuIn hindsight, @realDonaldTrump may have been less than credible when he promised to drain the swamp. https://t.co/ABM4wljE86Someone needs to remind the President that we have a First Amendment for a reason. Taking away press credentials from critical outlets is something dictators do. Not here!Good news: Committee just passed my amendment to move closer towards creating a US-Israel cyber center. Very important issue both our countries need to get on top of.It’s terrible that Kim Jong Un continues to use American citizens as bargaining chips for his own propaganda. I’m happy they’re coming home.

At the same time, the President must develop a coherent &amp; comprehensive strategy to end the threat of a nuclear North Korea. https://t.co/xnlqrG014rAlways a pleasure to be on the Fair and Balanced network! https://t.co/8OAK4Zli9bCongratulations to the next Governor of Ohio, @RichCordray! Did a great job leading the @CFPB!Proud to recognize #TeacherAppreciationDay and all the incredible teachers in Rhode Island and across our great country!Just ran into Big Papi. Got to thank him for all he’s done for New England, and especially his Game Four walkoff homer in the 2004 ALCS. #RedSoxNation (cc: @IanDon) https://t.co/jhYS4v2TJrCountries like North Korea now have even more reason to question whether President Trump won’t just change the terms of any current or future agreements when he feels like it. That will make us less respected across the world, and it does nothing to make us safer at home.In addition, the President’s decision undermines the United States’ reputation. We have always kept our word, but that changed today.For two years, the Iran deal has imposed the most intrusive nuclear inspections regime in the history of the world. It has prevented Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. It is not perfect, but the President’s decision will make it harder than ever to improve it.This is a reckless decision. It’s a decision that endangers our security and makes it harder for other countries to take us at our word.It is outrageous that President Trump wants to cut $7 billion in health care funding for kids in the name of “fiscal responsibility.” Working families shouldn’t pay for the huge tax cuts the President just gave to corporate special interests and the wealthiest Americans.The Trump administration’s new policy of separating children from their parents at the border is cruel, inhumane, and just plain wrong. It should be - and will be - vigorously opposed.I have to say, I knew the NRA was terrible. But I didn’t think they’d actually pick a guy who sold weapons to Iran as their new leader.@MarkOrangenblue @realDonaldTrump People like you who have called John McCain a traitor and refused to recognize his honorable service to our nation are a disgrace, Sir.Looking forward to when this bill is introduced later this year in Congress. Thanks to all our critical state and local partners who are working to preserve this GREAT natural resource.This will be the first river in Rhode Island designated as a National Wild and Scenic River, meaning more funding for conservation and more tourism revenue for Rhode Island.On the banks of the Wood River this morning. We presented the results of a three-year study demonstrating why this watershed deserves federal protection. https://t.co/1bh55Cr56W.@realDonaldTrump, just come clean already. Your “witch hunt” nonsense is getting exhausting. https://t.co/TTk9VAYTa3Great photo from Cranston with the @RIDPWomen executive committee! https://t.co/6x9IABxoGaGreat to be in Cranston with @SenJackReed this morning. https://t.co/6V1x2ZgH1HNow headed to Newport for Annual Police Parade to honor the brave men &amp; women who serve in law enforcement.  Thanks for what you do.@MiaForRep @SenJackReed Thanks, Mia!@IrwinJames327 @MSNBC Thanks!
