We are disappointed by today’s ruling, but we are not defeated. We will continue fighting for policies that empower hardworking families and protect the unions who support them. #Union #UnionStrong https://t.co/LylfwVzAf3Teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other union workers earn higher pay and have better access to medical care, retirement benefits, and paid leave than non-unionized workers.It is an unprecedented attack on the labor movement, which has helped bring countless individuals out of poverty, expanded the middle class, and strengthened our communities and economy.In siding with corporations over people, #SCOTUS is undercutting the freedom of all public service workers to negotiate for decent pay and safe, fair workplaces. #Union #UnionStrong https://t.co/uAwe3Cge6eOn this #LGBTEqualityDay, we celebrate the historic decisions that have been made on this date and vow to continue fighting for equal protection under the law. #Pride2018 https://t.co/DGteaqNqTV#NetNeutrality protects small businesses and innovators in our district by ensuring they have a level playing field online.

does not stop our fight against bigotry. We will continue working toward an America that unites families and seeks justice in every corner of society. #NoMuslimBanEver #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/f1NB4PYX53Today's #SCOTUS decision to uphold Pres. Trump’s xenophobic Muslim Ban represents another shameful mark on our nation’s history. It undermines a core American value of religious freedom &amp; puts the religious liberty of ALL Americans at risk #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/FDdT9naZnMVoting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, Americans want the full freedom to vote back.

Jails holding families will not abide by child welfare standards, depriving kids of mental health services and medical care. You cannot trade one form of child abuse for another.Separating children from their parents is inhumane, but locking families up together is not the solution to the crisis which President Trump created. https://t.co/qjZGSvVXGZChildren should not be ripped from the arms of their parents. Babies need to stay with their loving parents. The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct stops the #Trump administration’s government-sanctioned child abuse policy. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/7iy7RW4oQGThe U.S. has long been a beacon of fairness &amp; safety, ensuring that children &amp; families fleeing oppression and hardship are treated with dignity and respect. On this #WorldRefugeeDay we reaffirm U.S. commitment that we will not abandon the world’s most vulnerable populations.Separating children from their parents is inhumane, indefensible, and is a form of emotional violence. There is no justification for this cruelty, and it must end now. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/i76WvXzZoOToday we commemorate the 6th anniversary of #DACA, recognizing the successes of the program &amp; all young Dreamers who continue to make positive contributions to our economy &amp; their communities.

We reject these backwards fossil fuel-driven policies and must continue to invest in renewable energy sources.Also, as we have seen too often, when spills occur, the companies leave and foot taxpayers with the bill to clean up the mess. It may be a new year, but this is the same old agenda.California hasn’t allowed drilling off the coast for more than three decades and for good reason. Our pristine coastline provides enormous recreational and economic opportunities for the benefit of all Californians. https://t.co/Nc5NIB2ZmARepublicans just raised taxes on my constituents and millions of hardworking families.
