Not a good look?@corsairbear @realDonaldTrump I think you may have missed the sarcasm.I remember how important it was to Mitch McConnell that ‚Äúthe American people‚Äù get a say in the appointment of the last Supreme Court Justice.

Whatever you think of @realDonaldTrump, he got less than 50% support.

So I assume McConnell will be consistent.@thepasta_sniper  https://t.co/Iiq3VMRrXt@Matt5553 YupWhoa whoa whoa. We are a very proud part of Connecticut.

After a while, he said "Just stop funding ACORN!" and stormed out. Now he supports the least fiscally responsible admin ever.@ctblogger @POTUS Oh man. That brings back some memories. Shouting down a minister because he spoke in Spanish. Jeering a woman cancer survivor...@ctblogger @POTUS I certainly agree with that second part. They have zero legs to stand on. But I remain interested, if we're going to abandon norms too, what are the limits? I'm not getting much help on that.@2mins4holding Yes you can.@elkmovie Good question and interesting distinction.@SveaElske Again. No one is calling for "nice". But despite trying all afternoon, no one has articulated for me what the outer limits of incivility are.@ctbballfan Non sequitur. In these times in particular, we better walk and chew gum at the same time.@LHannich Absolutely. I don't think anyone would argue you have to be polite to a racist. But what level of incivility is ok? Is there no limiting principle?@203action Hmmm. That sounds very familiar. :)@smoneill01 False choice. So where do you draw the lines of what is acceptable and what is not? Are there no lines?  Should we be allowed violence?@Solaryellow731 True enough. My staff is always telling me not to feed the trolls. Happy to talk in future when you have something more constructive to say than calling people morons.@Solaryellow731 Name calling is the hallmark of poor argument.@NoDonaldnono So we should be silencing the point of view of others?@Honeybee0808195 I'm asking where the lines should be drawn.@jfcdy2 FBI and DOJ are not corrupt, despite what Devin Nunes says. Scott Pruitt is corrupt.@Solaryellow731 You are wrong. All of the last Presidents have "enforced the law". It's a question of how. Zero tolerance and family separation are not legally required.@darngoodload So tell me where the lines are.@chaunceyg202 Totally wrong. The President is legitimate. We have an electoral process which he won. That the administration is indecent and openly corrupt is not really arguable. It's there for all to see. You may excuse it, but it's there.Goldberg is not wrong. Desperate times and all.... But the question is, where are the lines? If we‚Äôre freed from the constraints of civility and respect, what lines cannot be ethically crossed? What actions make the problem worse? https://t.co/pnJ2yQ7uwUMy tweet of yesterday on decency, respect and civility set off a (generally) good debate on what the right response is to the norm crushing, indecency and open corruption of this Administration. Got me thinking. Here‚Äôs a solid counter argument to mine: https://t.co/bGAWWXweYU@thoughtwhirl @MichelleObama Fair enough.@stinakazSTF @ctblogger @MichelleObama I don't think we're making any such equation. What I'm saying is, let's not abandon the moral high ground just because the other side makes sport of doing so.@ctblogger @MichelleObama We must not become what we abhor.@hugh_mcglade Peaceful protest. Speak to EVERY elected official and hold them accountable. Organize, build networks and groups. Persuade people.A big thank you to all who participated in and attended my immigration panel this morning to discuss ending family separations and fixing our broken immigration system.

And then every day after.@amareb_ @MichelleObama This really has nothing to do with skin color. I‚Äôm an elected leader, so I will try to lead. But if it matters to you, I‚Äôm trying to promote the ideas of MLK and Gandhi, who were hardly secure white men.@domaco01 @MichelleObama Understood. Completely. I‚Äôve been fighting this administration non-stop. And we‚Äôve had some wins. And the election is in four months. Make your voice heard loud and unmistakably by delivering an unmistakable electoral rebuke. https://t.co/GAuEfc3Cil@KellyHT268 @MichelleObama Agree. But there are lines. Lines that should not be crossed. For their side and for ours.@Aeryndynamic @MichelleObama My point exactly.@iamthedane2 @MichelleObama @repjohnlewis I‚Äôm all for ‚Äúgood trouble‚Äù. That‚Äôs why I cited John Lewis. But there is not an uncivil or disrespectful atom in his body. And whatever anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúmood‚Äù is, we must not become what we abhor.@ByerBeThere @MichelleObama I never said nice. I never said polite. We need to win. But we do not win by descending into the indecency of those we oppose. We lose that way.@Grooveyleddy @MichelleObama And while many many things got us Trump, being polite was not one of them.@Grooveyleddy @MichelleObama I did not say polite.@GregGorman3 @MichelleObama I think you‚Äôre not paying attention.@mjmw61 @MichelleObama Not working? They are no longer breaking up families. Now we move on to reunification for all of them.@Teamx2rainbow @MichelleObama I was with those children 48 hours ago in TX. You can draw a direct line from them to a political leadership that has lost its moral bearings and all sense of decency. We must not become what we abhor.@EricBonaventure @MichelleObama Tell that to Martin Luther King Jr.@2yaks @MichelleObama See above.@ShonnaEnglish25 @MichelleObama I completely agree. But if Jesus stood for one thing, it was love, not anger or righteousness. Can‚Äôt tell you I understand it, but you remember what he said to do with our ‚Äúenemies‚Äù in Matthew 5:44?@thoughtwhirl @MichelleObama No, civil disobedience is precisely as labelled: civil. It is also disobedient, which is fine. But it is civil. Remember civility is a tool of the strong. Incivility is the crutch of the weak.@RoseannMilano @MichelleObama Nah. Need to get a new one üôÅ@ByerBeThere @MichelleObama We are not losing the fight. And no, not ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù.

Why I used the word ‚Äúcivil‚Äù.@deer_chair @MichelleObama Amen@TwentyFivePrcnt @MichelleObama @GOP That‚Äôs not true. They fear decency and civility. It‚Äôs why they applaud when we stoop to their tactics.@iamthedane2 @MichelleObama I did not say nice. And if you want to bring race into this, I suspect that MLK would also stand up for respect and decency. My colleague John Lewis is one of the most respectful, civil and dignified people I know.@kesayers @MichelleObama All the more reason not to sacrifice the moral high ground for no benefit or reward.@lil_lilly001 @MichelleObama No. Incivility and disrespect are the tools of the weak and the wrong. Don‚Äôt use them. Win right. We must not become what we abhor.@DaTroofHurtz @MichelleObama No. Incivility and disrespect are the tools of the weak and the wrong. Don‚Äôt use them. Win right. We must not become what we abhor.I feel very strongly that opposing this appalling President means fighting for and with decency, respect and civility. These are signifiers of strength, not of weakness. We need to model them for all, including our kids.

Our border must be secure. We are a nation of laws. But dehumanizing rhetoric about ‚Äúinfestation‚Äù and MS-13 and all migrants being criminals is wrong. Morally wrong. By any standard.Some things are hard about immigration. Some things are not. Seeing migrants as people is not. Despite what @realDonaldTrump says, most risk their lives to work in our restaurants, homes, buildings and fields like this one in Rio Hondo. It‚Äôs almost 100 outside. https://t.co/GBrURvFvaS@novelnotyetwrit Initially, they didn‚Äôt let us talk to detainees but we persisted and we did, so I do think we talked to a random group.@c_fauquier Well, for starters, they were young girls.We‚Äôve left McAllen and are headed to Port Isabel Detention Center.

As long as @gop cowers in fear, silence and Congressional inactivity, activism is essential and patriotic.As we always knew he could, @realDonaldTrump just signed an order supposedly ending the brutal separation of children and parents at our border. He did so because of the powerful moral voice that rose up and would not be denied. Thank you, one and all.@LynnSch98891174 I do. And we‚Äôve made dramatic progress reducing homelessness among veterans. Proud of that. And proud of standing agains our President‚Äôs deeply immoral policy.@PAMAE4 @secupp For decades, no president has chosen to separate children and families. They are not required to do so. This one did. It‚Äôs that simple.Calling them ‚Äútender age facilities‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make internment centers for babies any better. In fact, it shows an Orwellian awareness by the people carrying out these actions that they‚Äôre so very wrong.Republican (formerly, apparently) strategist for George Bush and John McCain. https://t.co/hRFH8OsIDFYeah.

We are not in a world in which the President's fantasy of a better deal is likely.We are now closer to a world in which centrifuges are spinning again in Iran and people are explaining to me why a military attack is the only way to stop an Iranian weapon of mass destruction.You know that Republicans are leading all three investigations, right? https://t.co/lEisvJDPtRWas feeling pretty smug about the full parking lot this morning at #Stamford JCC for my breakfast til I realized I was way outdrawn by Elmo next door. Elmo 1, Himes 0. https://t.co/3nDgSCoZh1Got to have breakfast with Post #142 Jewish War Veterans in #Stamford this morning. Good chat, real concern about increasing anti-semitism out there. https://t.co/fJG1TJ49ww@chaunceyg202 Read Heller.8) I will not stop working on your behalf until we have achieved these goals. Even when the fight seems uphill, even when we get tired, we know we are in this together. Let‚Äôs get to work.7) We need smarter laws to protect us and keep us safe. We need laws that make it harder to buy and use weapons whose only purpose is to kill as quickly as possible.6) Those of us who know people who have suffered through horrific shootings like Sandy Hook understand that his approach will cost more lives, both in continued mass shootings and in the deadly, daily gun violence we see across our country.5) He assured us that he speaks with ‚ÄúWayne and Chris‚Äù and the ‚Äúincredible‚Äù people at the NRA about how to protect children from violence. The solution that drew the most cheers from the audience? Arming teachers with concealed weapons.4) He argued against smart gun laws like the ones we have in Connecticut. The ones that we know save lives.3) He continued pushing the lie that only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun (despite the recent, life-saving heroism of James Shaw, Jr., who was unarmed, in a Tennessee Waffle House).2) After spending his opening congratulating himself on poll numbers, reading from print the Wall Street Journal, and bragging about ‚Äúdecimating Obamacare,‚Äù he launched into a full-throated defense of guns.1)  I saw Donald Trump's remarks yesterday at the NRA convention.  I‚Äôll cut to the chase.Yes, he does. https://t.co/SWnQiSBws9What universe do you live in? https://t.co/sseXUEinxlI always enjoy speaking to and with the Ys Men of #Westport, especially when I get to catch up with Ted Diamond, now 101 years old! https://t.co/yZeNDd3RBJCongratulations Julia Lin of Ridgefield High School @RidgefieldHS winner of my Congressional Arts Competition! https://t.co/JKoToQxCKc@GregGorman3 There was nothing about my tweet that ‚Äúdefended‚Äù it.

That doesn‚Äôt change the Libby situation. And I have not been silent on the Esty issue‚Äîspoke to Channel 12 next day.@ccbrtx4 @fiverrules @allahpundit Funny, because I‚Äôve spent the last several months, including last Friday, looking at the evidence.@dukesb12 @AgentCoopr702 @fiverrules @allahpundit Well, except for the several guilty pleas, couple dozen indictments, and gaggle of cooperating witnesses.@AgentCoopr702 @fiverrules @allahpundit Yeah, except that none of that is true. But thanks for playing.@fiverrules @allahpundit What has Mueller done to discredit himself?@LibCelebs And while it is true that I don‚Äôt much like the President (I‚Äôm funny about not liking boastful self-obsessed liars) you can‚Äôt really say I don‚Äôt like his policies because he really doesn‚Äôt have any.@LibCelebs And by the way, you look uncannily like Ronald Reagan. Now that was a Republican of grace and decency.@LibCelebs I did not say that. And every single one of your sentences is provably false. But thanks for playing.I spent several hours at the Department of Justice today reviewing the documents that Nunes, Trump et al have been screaming about. Had DOJ not started investigation/surveillance, it would have been a grossly negligent dereliction of duty. Not even close.I don‚Äôt know about the country, but it will take the Presidency years to recover from this President‚Äôs behavior. https://t.co/4LbEomThAWC√∂√∂l. Thank y√∂u! https://t.co/bJmHNHpfbXSchr√∂dinger‚Äôs Presidency: We‚Äôre bombing AND not bombing Syria. We‚Äôre out AND in TPP. We‚Äôre imposing AND not imposing tariffs on the Chinese. Tearing up AND not tearing up the Iran Deal.

Just don‚Äôt open the box.Freudian typo https://t.co/oHjXtbhxiX2/2 The American people are smart enough to see through this lame, limp, hypocritical go-nowhere patheticness. It‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt trust Congress. This is counterfeit legislative viagra.1/2 Right now, House Republicans are ‚Äúpassing‚Äù a balanced budget amdt to the Constitution. Right after blowing a historical $2 trillion hole in the budget through tax cuts + massive spending. Penance? Closing barn door? Whatever, it‚Äôs the most hypocritical thing I‚Äôve seen in DC.You cannot legally or constitutionally attack Syria without Congressional authorization. May or may not be a good idea. But the Constitution matters. https://t.co/wJhhcd6JGZ@RepJeffDuncan @nc2fl2011 You voted for the tax cuts which will add $1.8 trillion to the debt per CBO.Irony is dead. https://t.co/ni0EXcHRYN@hotelkeys Yes. And rightly so.I blame Congress as much as I blame Presidents for this unconstitutional war making tradition. Many members of Congress would rather not be held accountable for the consequences of a war vote. That‚Äôs not leadership. It‚Äôs laziness and fecklessness. 3/3Presidents of both parties have repeatedly violated the constitution and the law by going to war without Congressional approval. The law matters. So does the power of going to war only when validated by the representatives of the people. 2/3This is important: the War Powers Resolution (or ‚ÄúAct‚Äù as it has become known) DOES NOT give @realDonaldTrump the authority to strike Syria without Congressional approval absent an attack on us. Here is the key part of the law. 1/3 https://t.co/K0EJU928asNo better way to start the week than helping dozens of new Americans take the oath of citizenship at @fergusonlib in #Stamford w/@stamfordmayor https://t.co/d1suIrNHceHighlight of the week was catching up with Ian and Shep Murray who have built @vineyardvines into an amazing CT-based biz.

Generally agree, and I spend much of my time on Russia/election/Trump. I understand the existential threat. Note however, that Lamb barely ever mentioned DJT.As @realDonaldTrump floats around in his snow globe of chaos, crassness and corruption, it is time for every Member of Congress to prepare to create a statutory Special Prosecutor if Mueller is fired.As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I assure you, it has not concluded that there was no collusion. Not even close. We do see daily the damage you are doing to FBI and CIA. Putin thanks his lucky stars. https://t.co/InvRzAEw1g
