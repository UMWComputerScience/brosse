With all of the stories regarding the Supreme Court and the Trump Administration’s cruel family detention and separation policies, you might have missed the news about the #GOPBudget. 

Watch this week’s #UnderTheRadar for more: https://t.co/J0e65wwvWWWe have an opportunity to hold a hearing and get answers to the questions that need to be asked. Democrats will keep fighting to #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/z0bZCKqcboAmericans want the #CultureOfCorruption cultivated by rich lobbyists and massive corporations to end. Americans deserve #ABetterDeal https://t.co/eXK8azQGcrWomen’s rights, workers’ rights, LGBTQ rights, voting rights, big money in politics, and so much more is at stake when deciding the future of #SCOTUS. We cannot allow the President and his Congressional cronies to appoint an extremist to the bench.Today while demanding a hearing on President Trump's family separation policies, I quoted Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich, who reminded us that the soul of America is at stake.

#KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/EsAnb280IvWith #JANUS, @GovRauner targeted @afscme31 because they always stand up for working families and collective bargaining. 

This #SCOTUS decision won't change that. @afscme31 won't be stopped. We will fight harder than ever. 

#UNION #UnionStrong https://t.co/TE23obfLXEUnions gave us pensions, the weekend, child labor laws, &amp; many other protections we take for granted today. Unions built the American middle class. If we want good jobs, good wages, &amp; good benefits for American workers, we must defend the right to join a #UNION #Janus https://t.co/i5YWmcyIWaWe will fight harder than ever. https://t.co/NIwDJz6P6HIt’s a shame the Court has chosen to side with billionaires and corporations over teachers, firefighters, social workers, and emergency medical technicians.  #Janus #Union

https://t.co/4g7LZ3XT61#Janus is part of an aggressive, well-funded attack on federal, state and local, and private sector workers.Janus is about making it more difficult for state and local workers to join together in unions, to bargain collectively for fair wages and benefits, to promote safe workplaces, to blow the whistle on fraud and abuse, and to stand up for the people they serve. https://t.co/jd5hsJRAjQThis is a sad day for public employees and all of us who rely on them to provide us with the services we need, from keeping our air and water clean to teaching our children to protecting public health.  #Janus #Union

https://t.co/3wdK4MUBJ2#Janus is a terrible decision but it is not the final word.  Those of us who know that unions help working families succeed and communities prosper will not just continue the work to promote workplace democracy – we will fight harder than ever. https://t.co/fCGWNgxgDDI will stand with @RepJoeKennedy, @NancyPelosi and @HouseDemocrats today to stand up for the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.

We’ll keep fighting to #EndTheLies. #NIFLAvBecerraFake women’s health centers sued for the right to lie—and they won by a single vote. Courts matter. #EndTheLies #NIFLAvBecerra.Today, in a narrow decision in #NIFLAvBecerra, the Supreme Court granted fake clinics the right to lie to women about their health care options. We need to #EndTheLies and #ExposeFakeClinicsThree years ago today, love won and marriage equality became the law of the land. Happy #Pride! 

Now it’s time to move #EqualityForward by passing the Equality Act https://t.co/VlBF4KfoSoToday, activists from across the country are flying in to Washington to #SaveTheInternet and fight back against @AjitPaiFCC’s attack on #NetNeutralityThe fight for #NetNeutrality is far from over. @HouseDemocrats are working to bring the fight to #SaveTheInternet to a vote on the House floor. https://t.co/ANlJ7aSFEyAs the daughter of immigrants and a representative of one of the most diverse, multicultural, and welcoming districts in the country, I will continue to fight to build the welcoming, immigrant-rich America that I know.  #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/Kozfq7BoI6My people were refugees too. #JewsForRefugees #SCOTUS #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/zniyXKCwN4The President has made his racist and Islamophobic intentions clear from the day he began his campaign. Today, SCOTUS has helped him fulfill his nativist promise.

https://t.co/3p7mQTIH8cI am extremely disappointed by the Court’s decision. The Statue of Liberty is weeping today. https://t.co/o9YlYjWJWvMaybe my GOP colleagues don’t have the same constituents I do — seniors who call my office, sometimes in tears, wondering how they will afford their basic necessities and the prescription drugs they need. 

Or maybe they do have these constituents but they just. don’t. care. https://t.co/tbW8kIiIYzI spent most of yesterday in the Budget Committee debating the #GOPBudget, looking my Republican colleagues in the eye as they tried to justify a budget that includes massive cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid just to pay for the deficit created by the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/YSfOAimincTune in! https://t.co/3y6qP7Tby0I’m with @WhipHoyer and @NancyPelosi today to mark te six-month anniversary of the #GOPTaxScam and discuss its devastating consequences. https://t.co/p4Nb6lv7jGI’ll be speaking on the House floor to protest the Trump Administration inhumane treatment of immigrants. Tune in here:

https://t.co/J4rnzPNbb6For Erin, Taylor, Megan, William, and more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, we must keep fighting to #ProtectOurCare. 7/7William is a former photographer who lost his eyesight (and thus his job and insurance) due to a massive stroke. Thanks to the #ACA, he was able to find an affordable and robust insurance plan, which would be impossible if President Trump and AG Sessions get their way.  6/7Megan had a hard time finding insurance to cover pregnancy and childbirth. She found it thanks to the #ACA and had a happy, healthy baby. She’s at risk of losing her care if the Trump administration takes us back to the days when being a woman was a pre-existing condition.  5/7Taylor is HIV positive. He wrote me the last time the GOP tried to repeal the #ACA to tell me about the rough road he faced until he was able to receive care at @howardbrownhc thanks to the Affordable Care Act. We can’t leave Taylor out in the cold. We must #ProtectOurCare 4/7Erin is a type 1 diabetic. For years, she had been denied coverage because of this pre-existing condition. Thanks to the #ACA today no one can refuse to insure her and companies can no longer charge her higher premiums for her other “pre-existing condition” -- being a woman.  3/7The Trump Administration is refusing to defend the #ACA in court, meaning that more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care. Here are some of the stories that constituents have sent me over the years: 2/7It’s hard to stay focused with so much going on, but we can’t lose our focus now. We can’t stop fighting to #ProtectOurCare. 1/7And when that child asks why, I wish my colleagues would tell them the truth: that Republicans gave a massive, $2 trillion tax gift to billionaires and now the rest of the country is paying for it.  #GOPTaxScamI wish that my Republican colleagues would have to look one of these hungry kids in the eye and tell them that they won’t get the meals they’re used to receiving at school – often the only nutritious meal they’ll have all day.How cruel do my Republican colleagues have to be to rip food out of the mouths of hungry children?THREAD: If the Senate allows this bill to become law, 2 million Americans – that’s about 400,000 families – would lose nutrition assistance and 265,000 children would lose the school meals they depend on.

Ayse, you’re an inspiration! https://t.co/dNh56Q4YgxI had the privilege of meeting Ayse Eldes, the winner of @TheAward from my district today. This prestigious award recognizing youth achievement nationwide.

This cannot stand. Medicare is a benefit that Americans have EARNED. I opposed these cuts during our debate in the Budget Committee today. https://t.co/J55kHx8uRWRepublicans are waging war on anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs. 

TODAY in the House, they are trying to pass a #GOPbudget with $923 billion in cuts to anti-poverty programs and a Farm Bill that cuts #SNAP by $23 billion.House Republicans crafted the #GOPBudget – a statement of their misplaced values. They propose ripping health care away from millions; crippling Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; and slashing funding for education, infrastructure, anti-hunger &amp; anti-poverty programs. https://t.co/hGRlOWXyvNDespite the overwhelming Republican opposition, I was proud to support @RepDelbene’s amendment to protect SNAP from the #GOPBudget's attacks. https://t.co/kXeuNbxf5fI’m proud of @AmericanAir and @United for standing up for their values and the values of their customers. No one should be silent in the face of injustice 

#KeepFamiliesTogether

https://t.co/iPtbLDkSgT#ProtectOurCare https://t.co/BwFQT4LrBeThe #GOPBudget rips health care away from millions of Americans. Today in the House Budget Committee, I'm offering an amendment to protect Americans' health care. Tune in! https://t.co/2tmK72i7PnPresident Trump directed his Administration to engage in state-sanctioned child abuse, tried to use immigrant babies as political bargaining chips, sparked the outrage of a nation, and now is attempting to capitalize on the outrage to further distort our nation’s immigration lawsRead my full statement: https://t.co/h1pFiu6qG3Now is a moment of great moral divide and let’s be clear: there is a right side and a wrong side. 

History will be kind to those who defended families fleeing turmoil, children torn from their parents, and hard-working immigrants looking to build a brighter American future.Just when you think they've hit rock bottom... they reach a new low. 

https://t.co/LGzYbT8Ow8Today is #WorldRefugeeDay – excellent timing, isn’t it? 

I can’t think of a better day for Americans to think about the refugee experiences of those who founded and built our nation – and those who are now being kept from coming to our shores. 

https://t.co/WJusZ2Jn9J.@SpeakerRyan is trying to pass his immigration bill off as a ‘compromise’ – don’t buy it. Only a third of Dreamers would be protected under the bill and less than 20% of them would benefit from its pathway to citizenship. 

https://t.co/2sLv3DvMD9I’m standing with @HouseDemocrats, @NancyPelosi, @RepJerryNadler, and civil rights icon @DoloresHuerta to support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct and to tell the President that #familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/LMzMbMpNB1Thank you so much to Felix and Bruce for helping me tell the President that #FamiliesBelongTogether. 

We need powerful young voices like yours to remind Americans who we are as a country. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/bqEHxnOvNJAs a mother and a grandmother, I cannot stand this. 

How can anyone stand this?

This child abuse must end NOW. https://t.co/QbusbgrRe3Shame on them. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/dWSMYOKi98I’m here with my @HouseDemocrats colleagues (and with my friends Bruce and Felix) to tell President Trump to end his cruel family separation policies IMMEDIATELY.

Here's my statement on the #GOPBudget: https://t.co/XNr40VQMD0Proud to stand with @RepDarrenSoto, @TheRevAl, and representatives from our nation’s most prominent civil rights organizations today to tell President Trump that #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/RVsyBvvALfThis is not our America.

https://t.co/I3iFx7fTaKFar too many immigrant families are forced to spend this #FathersDay apart because of the Trump Administration’s inhumane policies. 

#FamiliesBelongTogether, Mr. Trump.

https://t.co/T8NiBte2wHHappy #Pride Month! https://t.co/PHMCNw6vUkUPDATE on today’s #FamiliesBelongTogether action and civil disobedience.

The Trump Administration’s policy institutionalizing child abuse is a new low, even for them. We won’t stop fighting back. https://t.co/dVhLyrknCXWe’re here. https://t.co/0cvzDDfOf6Apparently @CBP is brave enough to rip children away from their mothers but not enough to arrest members of Congress.

I proudly joined @rosadelauro and many other colleagues today in denouncing the Trump Admin’s cruel family separation policies. This is child abuse, plain and simple. https://t.co/UPVKjLSj3nWhat do you call a country that institutionalizes child abuse? Tragically we call that country the United States of America.

Imagine the agony of an immigrant mother having her children ripped away from her. Who are these people?! https://t.co/BkYwut4WAbThis meeting was a great photo op both for an American President seeking to prove his deal-making skills and for a despotic tyrant looking to appear powerful on the world stage. 

Last night was a handshake. The work begins today.

#NorthKoreaSummit https://t.co/iN0NI4xmuJAs we remember and honor the 49 beautiful lives that were senselessly taken at the #Pulse shooting two years ago, let’s #HonorThemWithAction by passing comprehensive gun safety legislation. https://t.co/viYKlYMr8fThe best way to mourn the loss of the #Pulse nightclub shooting victims is to #HonorThemWithAction. We need an assault weapons ban, we need universal background checks, we need the value of human life to persevere over the power of the gun lobby.We must pass comprehensive voting rights legislation and ensure that Americans of every color, creed, and economic status truly have an equal voice at the ballot box. Our democracy depends on it. https://t.co/1PoZN7s7n8We should be actively looking for ways to bring more people into the democratic process, not slamming the doors of democracy shut. 

https://t.co/CM9Z0jCTgpThis @nytimes article shockingly outlines the Trump Administration’s contempt for science and facts – and why it could prove disastrous as the nuclear summit with North Korea begins tonight.

https://t.co/ag31XNf3HXIn the 21st century, access to a free and open Internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right. I’m fighting for #NetNeutrality to protect that right by forcing a vote in the House.The Senate has already voted to #SaveTheInternet – now it’s our turn. We won’t stop fighting until we get a vote to reinstate #NetNeutrality in the House. https://t.co/rXKZllwT7sToday, President Trump’s awful, anti-consumer repeal of #NetNeutrality takes effect. But the fight to #SaveTheInternet is not over yet.

https://t.co/CDzVmlmz7cThe Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have been obsessive and persistent in their cruel campaign to rip health care away from millions of Americans.

https://t.co/2uEve14FuuThe Administration's actions could have devastating consequences for women, people with disabilities, working families, and the 130 million Americans living with #preexistingconditions.The Administration’s unprecedented decision to refuse to defend federal law in court is an atrocity. #ProtectOurCareMore on our lawsuit: 

https://t.co/dEHoBABsMtLast year I joined 197 of my colleagues in Congress in suing President Trump. Today, our lawsuit will be argued in court. In the video below I explained what the “Emoluments” clause of the Constitution is – and why we believe the President is in violation of it. #NoOneAboveTheLaw https://t.co/0OCWNh36k1In 2018, 53 years after #GriswoldVCT, we’re still fighting to defend women’s access to #BirthControl. We won’t let our hard-earned #ReproRights be rolled back.Access to #BirthControl gives women the ability to control their own bodies, plan their own families, and chart their own futures. 53 years after #GriswoldvCT, we must remain committed to defending this crucial right.53 years ago #SCOTUS ruled that women cannot be denied the right to access birth control – can someone please let @RealDonaldTrump and the other anti-woman extremists know?I’m talking to @StephMillerShow live now. Tune in! https://t.co/AuQksqPjbKCouldn’t agree with Senator @RonWyden more: “This report should eliminate any doubt that Trump’s tax law yanked Medicare closer to insolvency.”

The US needs to lead the charge in  passing comprehensive, thoughtful legislation to prepare us for the changes that will come.@openletterbot @GraceStenberg I’m with you all the way, Grace. All your friends should reach out to their Congressmen/women and Senators. It matters. Jan SchakowskyToday’s SCOTUS decision highlights the need for clear, nationwide protections for #LGBTQ Americans – we need to pass the #EqualityAct NOW.Businesses must be #OpenToAll.

#ProtectSNAP 

https://t.co/020awzKokxThis GOP #FarmBill bill is a blatant, senseless attack on millions of American families. Republicans are attempting to cut $23 billion from SNAP– the country’s most effective program in fighting hunger and tackling poverty.

We are a nation built by immigrants for immigrants, and we cannot allow President Trump to change that. https://t.co/R5UzFTovvUWhile President Trump was busy calling undocumented immigrants “animals”, his Administration was grappling with the question of what to do with the migrant children they plan to rip away from their parents.

https://t.co/uA6c79RgPYHere’s what one investment analyst told investors about President Trump’s drug pricing proposals: “Obviously, very, very positive to pharma. Essentially, we are not seeing anything about that speech which should concern investors.”

https://t.co/4M9ahMB4JaThis #MothersDay, far too many mothers in America are struggling to afford the skyrocketing costs of the prescription drugs their children need. They deserve better than lukewarm excuses for action from the Trump Administration.

https://t.co/bZjZ3BuE7D https://t.co/XDi7NDA3hdThis #MothersDay, we must recommit to opposing divisive Trump Administration policies that seek to rip families apart. #KeepFamiliesTogether 

https://t.co/CxtxgwXowFWe need to prioritize the investments in our teachers and schools to ensure that teachers are equipped with the resources to prepare our nation’s children for the future. #TeacherAppreciationWeek2018Across the country, from West Virginia to Arizona, thousands of teachers have been walking out and striking to oppose low pay and to demand we invest in public schools. In Illinois, we know this fight very well, and I stand with those educators. #TeacherAppreciationWeek2018Today, I want to say thank you to all public school teachers for the incredible work that they are doing to lead our students into the 21st century. #TeacherAppreciationWeek2018Congratulations to my dear friend @RepBarbaraLee, a true progressive champion for women and girls! https://t.co/Kj85Qf6Q1aBy violating the terms of the #IranDeal, President Trump has thrown the world into a crisis or his own creation, without an inkling of a strategy of plan for what comes next. https://t.co/9QfiiKBPidI will join @NancyPelosi and other colleagues at 10:30 AM today to discuss the president’s reckless #IranDeal decision. Tune in! https://t.co/8naAZazB9KNo one in America should have to decide between putting food on the table and paying for the life-saving medications their children need. But pharmaceutical corporations will keep raising their prices for one simple reason: because they can! https://t.co/8ANb5R5jff"Donald Trump is assembling a War Cabinet that includes John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, and yes, Gina Haspel. We cannot allow him to get his way and take America back to the dark days of torture." Proud to join @SenTinaSmith &amp; the Center for Victims of Torture to oppose her nomination. https://t.co/m7UQ9IwIwq“I join my colleagues and those gathered here today in telling all Senators to vote NO on torture by voting NO on #GinaHaspel” https://t.co/BpnOYPXVjaAs we discuss solutions to the #OpioidCrisis in the Energy and Commerce Committee this week, it is important to remember that we have a program with proven success in treating substance use disorder – #Medicaid. 

We must expand – not cut – this treasured program. https://t.co/qvJkAtNTP4“President Trump has consistently demonstrated his ignorance of the complexity of the world’s challenges and today’s decision further highlights his inability to protect U.S. interests abroad.” 

#IranDeal #JCPOA https://t.co/k7JGpt8ILcMy full statement: https://t.co/egHHrV1dNGThe #IranDeal is working, and the Middle East and the entire world are much safer for it. I join the leaders of Germany, France, Great Britain, China, and Russia, as well as peace-loving men &amp; women around the world, in encouraging –even imploring– Mr. Trump to keep it in place. https://t.co/NyuBxNLJGdThe #IranDeal was an historic triumph of diplomacy. The United States, France, China, Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom came together and successfully prevented the possibility of a nuclear armed Iran without a single fired bullet or a single life lost.As #SeniorCorpsWeek comes to an end, I would like to extend my deep gratitude to the hundreds of seniors in my district, and thousands more in Illinois, who volunteer through Seniors Corps and make an enormous impact in their communities. https://t.co/QtMpnOQ0yKCongratulations to the Village of Glenview, Illinois EPA, &amp; the Glenview community on a well-deserved award! As all residents of Glenview know, The Glen is a prime example of the great things that can be accomplished when local govts and federal agencies team up &amp; get to work. https://t.co/RE11t3YcwSI’m always proud of my district, and I’m happy to have just one more thing to brag about today. 

https://t.co/KBud9KG2YPCongratulations to Nasir Bin Zakaria, a dear friend and the founder of the Center, for receiving the Global Citizenship Hero award this year.The Rohingya Cultural Center in my district is the only of its kind in the country, serving more than 400 Rohingya families in our community and providing advocacy for all Rohingyas. 

https://t.co/5tEQyWhJPSWe cannot allow this administration to change the character of our country. We are a nation built by immigrants, for immigrants – we cannot leave them out in the cold.The Department of Homeland Security under President Trump has already ripped TPS protections away from nearly 200,000 Salvadorans, 50,000 Haitians, and 9,000 Nepalis – not to mention its cruel decision to throw the lives of 1.8 million Dreamers into limbo.
https://t.co/VRMG5SZoPwMany have been here since 1999 and have become a part of the American tapestry, building families, starting businesses, and contributing immensely to our communities.The 50,000+ Hondurans who will be impacted by President Trump's heartless TPS decision came to the US fleeing unimaginable violence.Shame on Secretary Nielsen and President Trump for once again turning their backs on men, women, and children who face dangerous – often deadly – circumstances if they were to be return to their country of origin.

https://t.co/5pBHw0VhBnWe’ve known since the beginning that these GOP policies are devastating for Americans, but it’s nice to see Republicans coming clean.

https://t.co/ZokGTIZgGJ https://t.co/t2GoOhCKvyYesterday, Marco Rubio admitted that “there’s no evidence whatsoever” that the benefits of the #GOPTaxScam have reached the American worker. Now, former Trump HHS Secretary Tom Price has admitted that repealing #Obamacare will raise health care costs for Americans.Today in “President Trump’s cabinet deepens the swamp” news: Scott Pruitt’s $100,000 trip to Morocco was arranged by a lobbyist buddy of his who was later awarded a lucrative contract by the Moroccan government. #BootPruitt

https://t.co/EJCv5nhgeWThanks to the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Act, all passenger vehicles are now required to have backup cameras, which will go a long way in preventing backing crashes. https://t.co/fBcuQc7VXc#MayDay is also a perfect opportunity to celebrate and pledge our support to labor unions, without which we would not have the pensions, weekends, child labor laws, or many of the protections we take for granted today.I join workers in the United States and around the world celebrating #MayDay by demanding better working conditions, better wages, and better benefits.Maine South High School’s Constitution team came to Washington for the National We the People Constitution team championship and did not disappoint. Congratulations on placing in the top ten. It was an honor to meet you! https://t.co/cbSejafv1RHere’s something important you might have missed about the White House Correspondent’s Association dinner: three @NorthwesternU journalism students were honored! 

Congratulations to @MedillSchool and these three bright young students.

https://t.co/fDB1yjnejJBen Carson’s proposal to triple the rent for federally subsidized housing would put close to 1 million CHILDREN at risk of homelessness. This is an outrage and an affront on American values. A great country doesn't leave its children out in the cold.
https://t.co/iQM55Cve8VI made good on my #NCAA bet with repdingell today. 

Congrats to both @ramblersmbb and… https://t.co/jvIDfGstXeI think I look better in maroon and gold, thank you very much. 

We’ll get ‘em next year, @RamblersMBB. https://t.co/qU6eNxYBHSThank you for your advocacy, #nursestakedc.

You look powerful today! https://t.co/u8t03jHl44I’m rallying with #nursestakedc today in front of the Capitol to demand safe staffing ratios.

Safe staffing saves lives. https://t.co/yNvDjDZuJGRepublicans aren’t even willing to hear the truth about prescription drug costs, let alone do anything substantial to curb them. I wish I could say I was surprised.

Read more here: https://t.co/cuQFCM8amwToday, the Health Subcommittee considered 64 bills to deal with the opioid epidemic. Not only did none of the bills deal with drug prices – Republicans refused to consider to two amendments I offered to make up for that failure.As with many other life-saving drugs, the costs of naloxone, which has been on the market since 1971, are exorbitant and growing dramatically as the need increases and pharmaceutical corporations see an opportunity to profit.In communities affected by the #opioidcrisis, emergency medical personnel, first responders and even the public are being encouraged to stock naloxone – an opioid overdose reversal drug that can literally mean the difference between life and death for patients. https://t.co/PHaEYUIcb3Now they are facing a man-made threat that would pull public dollars out of public education and close hundreds of schools – affecting thousands of students on the island.I stand today with students, parents and teachers in #PuertoRico who are fighting to protect public education.  Puerto Ricans are still dealing with the horrific damage created by Hurricanes Maria and Irma – and the Trump Administration’s failure to come to their aid. https://t.co/unpjIvvZYkMick Mulvaney said there was a “hierarchy” in his office in Congress: “If you’re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn’t talk to you. If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.”

I have a rule in my office. My door is open to all. Mulvaney is a disgrace.Today, the Supreme Court heard arguments to decide the fate of the of President Trump’s hateful and un-American #MulsimBan. I continue to stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters to say #NoMuslimBanEver

https://t.co/4OfGvuPrxJA great victory for #Dreamers! But this does not change the facts: Congress must pass a permanent legislative solution for these bright young people whose lives have been upended by President Trump’s reckless actions

https://t.co/9O1ltbUXSEI just published “Rana Plaza, five years later.” https://t.co/lFV25qrzuFHere’s what more than 100 retired Military Leaders said about confirming Gina Haspel:

“It would send a terrible signal to confirm as the next Director of the CIA someone who was so intimately involved in this dark chapter of our nation’s history.”

https://t.co/jCL7up5EiY#EarthDay is the perfect time to recommit ourselves to think green in every area of our lives and to demand that our government and American corporations do the same.Families in my district want to drink clean water and breathe clean air. Our drinking water is too important to take for granted. That’s why I’m so proud to reintroduce the Water CUPS Act today.

More about my bill and #EarthDay2018: https://t.co/tfbvt7ziZ9Even now, hope remains. Cities and states are leading the fight to combat climate change, and Americans remain engaged on environmental issues. These issues hit close to home. https://t.co/NKs21b24BLFrom appointing #PollutingPruitt to head the EPA and roll back Obama-era environmental protections to isolating us from the rest of the world by leaving the Paris agreement, President Trump has managed to make a perilous situation even worse. #EarthDay2018This year, #EarthDay should be a moment of reckoning for people in the United States and around the world. Our environment is more imperiled than ever before, and the Trump Administration is doing nothing to help.Since #Columbine 19 years ago, 208,000 students have experienced gun violence. That’s 208,000 too many. We need to #EndGunViolence.

https://t.co/bbVNmZ0f03Today, America’s youth have taken the reins. They are organized and energized and hoping to make change. They have my full support.

https://t.co/QcLTjJKKTX https://t.co/FzQ2B0NS9k19 years ago I was just starting my first term in Congress when the #Columbine shooting rocked the nation. For almost two decades since, our nation has witnessed school shooting after school shooting, and Congress has done nothing to stem the tide of #GunViolence.In this #Time100 piece, @ChrisBorland_ writes of “the quiet courage of Dr. Ann McKee” and her research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Congratulations, Dr. McKee, very well deserved.

https://t.co/hDWGOEtTT1Earlier this week, I participated in Robert Frost Elementary School’s diversity parade. What a wonderful way to celebrate our community’s strength in diversity! https://t.co/qcGP98qBewOn top of the endless scandals, @EPAScottPruitt has weaponized the @EPA against the environment he’s supposed to be protecting. Proud to join over 120 of my colleagues in demanding that we #BootPruitt.@EPAScottPruitt is currently under at least SEVEN separate independent federal investigations. He needs to be held accountable for his failures at @EPA – that is why I am calling for his immediate resignation. #BootPruitt#PollutingPruitt’s gotta go. Today I joined over 120 of my colleagues on a resolution calling for him to resign. We need to #BootPruitt https://t.co/lHmA6iCHYsInstead of reducing income inequality, the #GOPTaxScam widens the gap between the richest 1% and the rest of Americans. Shame on them!

Americans deserve #ABetterDeal https://t.co/3NWP3DPz8PToday is #TaxDay, and it’s a day for corporate CEOs and wealthy shareholders to celebrate. The #GOPTaxScam will give 86% of its benefits to the wealthiest 1% and leave middle-class families in the cold. 

Americans deserve #ABetterDeal https://t.co/GjEXbGWNQI86 million middle classes will see their taxes go up, and the wealthiest 1% in our country will get 83% of the tax benefits – that’s the #GOPTaxScamHere’s the “scam” in the #GOPTaxScam: Corporate CEOs get a huge tax cut while middle-class families get a $2.3 trillion hole in the budget that the GOP will use as an excuse to go after treasured programs like Social Security and Medicare. https://t.co/uMZGavkeehIn Illinois, the richest 5% will get almost two thirds of the tax breaks -- #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/yUMiwjN4HGAs Americans across the country crunch the numbers on their family’s finances on #TaxDay, it's a good time to discuss the devastating effects of the #GOPTaxScamIn our letter, we list six potential options to lower health care costs for #Illinois residents and make clear that states can and must step up to ensure families are protected from crushing health care costs brought on by the inaction of President Trump and the GOP Congress.While the Trump Administration and the Republican Congress have continued their efforts to undermine the #ACA and are busy pushing policies that would reduce enrollment and raise premiums and out-of-pocket costs for middle-class families, we're providing solutions.Today, all 11 Dems in the House sent Governor Rauner a letter asking him, yet again, to get engaged and work with us on lowering health care costs and expanding access to people across Illinois. 

#Twill https://t.co/DnuGbXeiLuJoining Politics Tonight with @PaulLisnek on @WGNTV — tune in!Now, they want to amend our Constitution to require that we can only spend in any given year what we raise in tax revenues in that same year – after having just cut those revenues. How will they pay for it? Again, of course, on the backs of seniors. Shameless! https://t.co/adiyfIsMq6Second, they offer budgets that would fill that gap by cutting more than $2T in #SocialSecurity, #Medicare, &amp; #MedicaidFirst, the GOP passed a #GOPTaxScam that blows a $2 trillion hole in the budget to benefit only the wealthy.The memory of those who perished in the Holocaust will not be forgotten. May they forever be for a blessing.

Read my full statement here: https://t.co/4Ez8a8dsIPThis Yom HaShoah, I remain firmly committed to advocating on behalf of the people of the 9th District for benefits for Holocaust survivors, comprehensive Holocaust education, and combatting anti-Semitism worldwide.Today, on #YomHaShoah, Jews in Israel and around the world pause to remember the 6 million Jewish lives lost in the Holocaust. https://t.co/2j7bRWIJD4Today, GOP stands for “Get Old People”. 

The #BalancedBudgetAmendment that they’re bringing to the floor this week would be devastating for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. https://t.co/lQfgpZyioBMr. Zuckerberg has a long list of growth and success, but he also has a long list of apologies after apologies. This is proof to me that self-regulation does not work. We need action from Congress.We need answers from Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook's misuse of user data. I'll be asking the questions in the next few minutes. 

Tune in: https://t.co/HTSmcHv7phThe American people deserve more than apologies and promises. They deserve action from their Congress.

Thank you for having me, it was a pleasure to hear from you! https://t.co/vR9wPtdmgv"History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.” 

Today and every day, may Dr. King’s memory remind us to never become bystanders to bigotry. https://t.co/NDaAoPQC7NIn our letter, we encouraged the @FTC to thoroughly investigate Facebook’s actions and, in the event that it finds wrongdoing on Facebook’s part, impose penalties that send a clear message about the severity of this issue.

And congratulations, of course, to @RamblersMBB for making Illinois so proud with an incredible season!The revelations of corruption, incompetence and cronyism coming out of the White House are so frequent it’s hard to keep track of them. It seems like every day we hear about another #PollutingPruitt scandal. Why does he still have a job? #BootPruitt

https://t.co/eQmPkYcODRV for Victory! Let’s go Ramblers! 

@RamblersMBB #RambleOn #OnwardLU #NoFinishLine https://t.co/snM5gTo64AWith Sister Jean on our side, Coach Porter Moser calling our shots, and the Ramblers exhibiting the team work and accuracy they have had all season long, there truly is #NoFinishLine.’ Ramble on! https://t.co/fpwjahx6goAs much as I love Michigan superfans @RepDebDingell and @JohnDingell, I can’t wait to watch the Ramblers beat the Wolverines tomorrow.  

We made a little bet for the game — loser has to wear the winning team’s gear for a day! 

#OnwardLU!Few know more and care more about veterans than Will Fischer and @VoteVets. Watch Will explain why the push for privatization is so dangerous:

@will_c_fischer https://t.co/xmmQ8nEfuFDavid Shulkin was ousted from his top post at the VA by people who want to enrich the wealthy and weaken care for our nation’s veterans by privatizing Veteran’s Health care. Read more about why privatization would be disastrous for veterans:
 
https://t.co/Q5drFDmmGeOn top of shirking his responsibilities to our planet and public health, #PollutingPruitt has wasted millions in taxpayer dollars on his first-class flights. We need to #bootPruitt

https://t.co/jQLb8p3ZwwWhat an honor! Thank you @NetworkLobby for your tireless activism. https://t.co/T2ZMqoeqmCProud to see Illinois Attorney General @LisaMadigan among those suing the Trump Administration over its attempts to weaponize the census against immigrant-rich states and communities. We need a free, fair, and accurate #Census .

https://t.co/1NtXBa9ludFollowing the energy of this weekend’s marches on #GunSafety, we need action. Congress needs to lead, and @SpeakerRyan needs to give us a vote on gun safety legislation as soon as Congress returns. 

Our nation’s children demand it and their lives depend on it. #MarchForOurLives#PollutingPruitt has weaponized the EPA, turning the Agency in charge of protecting the environment into one of the greatest threats our environment faces. 

https://t.co/G6545FcnPiRetired Admirals and Generals are saying it loud and clear: President Trump’s transphobic ban is “a troubling move backward.” We must protect #TransTroops

https://t.co/JMvkGwUVsEThis cannot stand.This nativist, and quite possibly illegal, move will completely compromise the census and is designed to undercount and underfund immigrant communities. We need an accurate, unbiased count of the population living in our country – that’s why our constitution requires it.The Trump Commerce Department has decided to politicize our country’s #census by including a citizenship question into the 2020 census.

I am awed by the activism of the students, and I have had the chance to meet them and rally with them both at home in Illinois and in Washington, DC.From the horrifying reality of constant school shootings, to the everyday threats of gun violence faced in cities like Chicago, it is clear that our country must make significant changes to protect our children and our communities.In cities across the country, marches have been organized by young activists who have had enough of the gun violence that plagues our communities. #MarchForOurLivesToday, hundreds of thousands of Americans will take to the streets to demand legislative action on #GunSafety.Today marks the eighth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law. I spoke on the House floor this week to commemorate the occasion and speak out against Republican efforts to undermine Americans’ healthcare. #ABetterDeal #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/JuFyQtq6JeI spoke to the Women Evanston Business Owners at their quarterly meeting today to discuss a broad range of issues relevant to our local business community.

We live in the richest country in the world at the richest time in our history. No American should ever have to go hungry, especially not our nation’s children, seniors, and veterans. https://t.co/Si0i40mIhDNOW you care about the Dreamers Mr. President?

#SweetSixteen #NCAATournament #NCAA #RambleOn #OnwardLU https://t.co/lP03ng1xDcMy full statement on today's omnibus: https://t.co/hvRk3LoIMJI will continue to resist Republicans’ wrongheaded priorities. Americans demand better health care, safer communities, and a long-term solution for Dreamers. Once again, Republicans in Congress failed to deliver.I applaud Leader @NancyPelosi, Ranking Member @NitaLowey , and the Democratic members of the Appropriations Committee for delivering real victories for the American people. However, I could not in good conscience vote in favor of a spending bill that leaves many Americans behind.The omnibus bill passed by the House earlier today includes many hard-won Democratic priorities, but it leaves major issues unresolved.
