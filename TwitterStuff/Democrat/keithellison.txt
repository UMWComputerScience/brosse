Disgraceful.The American people didn’t send us to Congress to work for Wall Street. I have no doubt that millions of people will remember this vote, and they will make their voices heard. https://t.co/sOqiMxpGBuI urge my colleagues to vote No on S. 2155, which rolls back protections we put in place to prevent another financial crash. We have seen this movie before, and it is the American people who pay. #BankLobbyistAct https://t.co/v4G4D8Qbr4Wanted to let you know that Bryan Stevenson, widely regarded as the nation’s leading voice on criminal justice reform, and his organization Equal Justice Initiative has announced support for the FIRST STEP Act.  I will be voting YES..@IndivisibleTeam thanks for organizing people all over America. Go for it! https://t.co/YpiM3jxGKZWhy is the U.S. House voting today on S. 2155, a bill that increases the chance of another taxpayer bailout? Sadly, it's a simple answer: Because it makes a few people a lot of money. https://t.co/aYdKxsjcJiToday the U.S. House will vote on the #BankLobbyistAct, a bill that benefits big banks already awash with money while hurting the American people. I'm a strong NO and speaking LIVE with @IndivisibleTeam: https://t.co/eoNsYC54iF https://t.co/McZZq8a57WToday the U.S. House will vote on rolling back the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). If you've never experienced the sting of discrimination maybe HMDA is just a pesky regulation to you. But it isn't for all the people who need it to protect them when they apply for a loan. https://t.co/kGSzQjNhcTTomorrow the U.S. House is expected to vote on S. 2155, a bill to roll back some of the protections against Wall Street greed that we put in place after the financial crash. I will do everything I can to see this #BankLobbyistAct defeated. https://t.co/2FJ0M7eFH0Justice Gorsuch cast the deciding vote to tip the scales in favor of corporate power even further. We cannot have true freedom when workers lack a strong voice in their workplaces. https://t.co/GKzHstnk9WDemocrats are set to introduce anti-corruption proposals Monday billed as “A Better Deal for Our Democracy.” https://t.co/78FBzvCtxYThank you for a lifetime of leadership Javier! https://t.co/RVZhhikHslIsaiah’s cousins and siblings and uncles and aunts all came down for his big law school graduation day.  Parents too! https://t.co/RDJYXNvXWCCongratulations to my son, Isaiah Ellison, for graduating from Tulane Law School tomorrow.  Awesome. https://t.co/fDwDkhrnPzFor years, the Farm Bill has been about supporting farmers, strengthening communities and providing food for America. I am disappointed that my GOP colleagues instead decided to push a partisan and controversial bill that would harm our environment and families in need. https://t.co/IEMXKz1FYPThe SNAP food assistance program has helped lift millions of families out of poverty. The #GOPFarmBill's proposed cuts to SNAP are careless and unacceptable. https://t.co/4J1oO1ZiTxHere’s the effect of CEO Hoarding. READ: “Almost half of US families can't afford basics like rent and food” - CNN Money https://t.co/uXkEHvUlnWThank you @AmandaK_B and @JasonKander for your remarkable work on behalf on Democracy.  @letamericavote @TheDemocrats https://t.co/0E3tpIWTRgThe Republicans' Farm Bill, in its current form, would roll back protections against pesticides being sprayed into waterways. It's a danger to our health and our environment. https://t.co/c2MOzmkt8yPlease watch this! https://t.co/C0D0GRzzKTThe GOP's Farm Bill would force as many as 2 million Americans off of SNAP food assistance. We should not be shaming people who are in a rough patch in their lives out of accepting the food they need to get by and get back on their feet. https://t.co/RdcRABVY2KSome of my colleagues may have forgotten how bad the financial crash was but I haven't. This #BankLobbyistAct increases the chances of another taxpayer bailout &amp; makes it easier for lenders to discriminate against communities of color. I will vote NO. https://t.co/phAPeljXV170% of poor children live with an adult who works.A full time worker earning the federal minimum wage makes $15,080 per year.In 2016, 40.6 million people in the US lived in poverty."When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time," said Maya Angelou. How many times does Trump have to tell us that he considers some people to be "animals" or from "s--hole countries," before we mobilize, organize and vote him and people who think like him out? https://t.co/cnzCSn9TNNAt nearly every company in the report, the median worker wouldn't make in an entire 45-year career what their CEO makes in a single year. At some companies it would take workers over 100 careers. https://t.co/uZA2L65byIFor years, CEOs fought the requirement to disclose their pay compared to their workers. My report, Rewarding or Hoarding, shows us why. Data disclosed for the first time this year finds the average CEO made 339 times more than the median employee. https://t.co/vgxRZJz8bH https://t.co/pxQTHGAPkAPlease watch University of Minnesota commencement speaker and my awesome staffer, Cheniqua Johnson.  2018 CEHD Undergraduate Commencement Ceremony https://t.co/dn3S9J1jum via @YouTubeSolidarity and power to @BCTGM_Nabisco and the more than 130 faith leaders fighting for worker justice at the @MDLZ shareholder meeting today. #checkthelabel https://t.co/FycKirQTWVTeachers are now marching in NC.

Let's keep it up and bring it home! #NetNeutrality https://t.co/oVi4mDTUDDThis concentration and hoarding of wealth has consequences. All this extra money they have corrupts our politics absolutely. We need to ban stock buybacks and we need to empower workers. https://t.co/dxhK2NHJQWA free and open internet is the great equalizer of our time. #NetNeutrality is a social justice issue, and I hope my colleagues in the Senate will vote to restore it today. https://t.co/ioplTLWUn9It would take the median Mattel worker nearly five millennia to make what their CEO makes in a year. This vast inequality is not just immoral -- it is a crisis for our democracy.

My full report: https://t.co/vgxRZJhxk9 https://t.co/mpbex40CuDCEOs fought to kill the pay disclosure rule tooth and nail. Now we know why. A new report from my office finds it would take the median worker at some of these companies nearly 5,000 years to make what their CEO makes in a single year. https://t.co/ODTnqOgmvWRead Rewarding or Hoarding: an examination of CEO-to-worker pat ratios required by Dodd-Frank. https://t.co/xM1Ycb66QP https://t.co/ODTnqOgmvWRamadan Mubarak to All.Thanks for your great work for the AMERICAN people. @SenSanders @RickNolanMN @RepBarragan @TulsiGabbard @RepJayapal @RepRoKhanna https://t.co/i4o8ewrHMxIT’S NOT WHERE YOU THINK IT IS. watch.

We can save lives if we implement a single-payer Medicare for All system that negotiates lower drug prices. https://t.co/dLQJz9FSLMI can't say the feeling is mutual, but here's my next prediction: The people are energized, we are going to end the hate and corruption of this administration, and we will take this country back for working people of all backgrounds. https://t.co/zAQiCqmhEm50 years after his death, let's remember MLK led a movement to align American reality with the American ideal that all people are created equal, and that the struggles for racial and economic justice are deeply intertwined. #JobsAndJustice https://t.co/BvjIYnUbKdThe Awesome folks of Wisconsin deserve better than Scott Walker’s trickle-down non-sense.
