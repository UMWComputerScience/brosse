@chefjoseandres @WCKitchen @brianschatz @HawaiiRedCross @cheftkilcoyne Looking forward to meeting the @WCKitchen team Monday. Mahalo nui for the work you're doing!The people, united, will never be defeated. Proud to stand with protesters in the Capitol calling to #endfamilydetention https://t.co/LBt1T8GfheThe Supreme Court’s decision in Janus is the just latest blow in a decades-long attack on working people. I’m introducing the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act to protect and strengthen the fundamental power of unions. Watch live:
https://t.co/GJO7xBSgxCI’m calling on everyone to make sure that the next person who sits on the Supreme Court bases their decisions on law, the facts, precedent, and overall upholding the Constitution and American values we all share. https://t.co/2Etq2BU1fIShould there be hearings, I will exercise my Constitutional duty to determine whether any nominee appointed will respect the law, the Constitution, and American values.Donald Trump has vowed that the Supreme Court should always remain Republican. The Supreme Court should be above politics, qualified, and exercise fair and independent judgment.A nominee that is intent on carrying out the right-wing ideology of the President and his most extreme supporters.If the President’s nominee to the Supreme Court is anything like the nominees he’s been sending to the lower federal court, I expect that we will see a nominee hand-picked by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.The Court’s decision continues an assault funded by far-right groups on working people. We must fight back. Joined by my Senate and House colleagues, I’ll be introducing a bill to establish the right of every public sector employee to join a union and bargain collectively.The partisan, political decision from the Supreme Court in #Janus will undermine public sector unions’ ability to fight for these basic protections for the 17.3 million public employees they represent.America’s public sector workers teach and nurture our children, keep us safe, and care for our families. As #union members, they are empowered through collective action to fight for fair wages and work conditions..@realDonaldTrump's targeting of minority groups isn't a dog whistle. It's a bullhorn.By ignoring the President’s clear intent to discriminate against Muslims, the Court handed the President unfettered power to continue to target minorities.Today is a dark day for our country. Every time our country has singled out a minority group for discriminatory treatment, we have been proven very, very wrong. The Supreme Court’s decision in #TrumpvHawaii will be no different.Proud to work with Rep. @DorisMatsui to introduce a bill to strengthen #TitleIX and honor the work of our trailblazing friends Patsy Mink and Louise Slaughter. https://t.co/u2mT5W7lhQYears from now, stories will be written about this dark moment in our nation’s history and what happened to these children. People will judge what we did and how we responded. #EndFamilyDetention https://t.co/SroZ0kitaQI will continue to fight against this president’s reprehensible actions that dehumanize immigrants, tear families apart, and undermine our country’s moral leadership.What’s happening to these children feels personal to me. Like so many people, I’ve found that my anger and emotions about this issue aren’t far below the surface.Congress has a responsibility to repair our broken immigration system – and we tried hard in 2013 with months of hard work and bipartisan compromise.
We cannot and should not enact a patchwork solution that enshrines Donald Trump’s hatred and fear of immigrants into law.There is nothing in the law that requires a zero-tolerance approach at the border – it was a choice that Donald Trump and his administration made. And these children are suffering the consequences. The President’s actions are unnecessary and cruel – but they aren’t surprising.The President of the United States and his administration are playing games with the lives of innocent children. Tonight, my colleagues and I are on the floor opposing family separation and detention. Watch live here: https://t.co/u0FNiF4gpT

#HandcuffsForAllI literally keep a binder called "Gorsuch Watch." Ask my staff. https://t.co/gtdhgfs86WWhen my family came to this country, we didn't have anything. I didn't speak English.

As @nytopinion said, Congress must take action to keep families together &amp; provide children with legal counsel by passing my Fair Day in Court for Kids Act. https://t.co/xgNGilKRA5I was honored to introduce Admiral Harry Harris during his Senate confirmation hearing to serve as our next Ambassador to South Korea.

Now he's @realDonaldTrump's nominee to a lifetime judicial appointment. #RunFarrAwayICYMI: Until we return to a normal advice and consent process, I will continue to oppose invoking cloture on any judicial nominee. Here's why: https://t.co/FepOxU3Gll
#CourtsMatter https://t.co/KthNPXYomAThere's just one week left until the Singapore Summit-- and it's deeply concerning that President Trump has yet to outline a coherent strategy or detail U.S. priorities going into this meeting with Kim Jong Un. https://t.co/o7wQMdGvw1By saying he has an absolute right to pardon himself, @realdonaldtrump continues to act like a dictator or an absolute monarch. In a democracy, no one is above the law, including him.⚡️ “Celebrating AAPI Women during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month”

He has referred to Kim Jong Un as “short and fat” and “Rocket Man.” Ironic that he cancelled the Singapore summit because Kim Jong Un insulted @VP. Making decisions on the basis of name calling is no way to conduct foreign policy.Neil Gorsuch's record before he got to SCOTUS provided a window into what he would do as a Justice. Acting as if the extreme positions of Trump nominees will not matter, or can be set aside by empty platitudes, makes the Senate a rubber stamp for @POTUS. #CourtsMatter https://t.co/QEQ363zP9C@NASA As one of the first women to be inducted in the International Surfing Museum's Walk of Fame, Rell Sun was the top ranked women's longboard champion who helped established the first women's professional tour. #APAHM https://t.co/oQW0bPES1d@NASA Grace Lee Boggs was a civil rights activist, author, philosopher and feminist.

After extensive consultation with our delegation, the White House nominated two highly-qualified nominees for judicial vacancies in our state.@senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley But let’s not argue stats, let’s discuss what blue slips are really about: consultation with home state Senators to ensure judicial nominees in their states are highly qualified, understand the importance of applying the law fairly, and meet the needs of their communities.@senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley This is wrong. The Judiciary Committee has never held a hearing for a judicial nominee with 2 unreturned blue slips in the modern history of the Senate.Disappointed to see Chairman @ChuckGrassley plans to hold a hearing for a judicial nominee to the 9th Circuit from Oregon without the consent of both home-state Senators.

(1/2)The @NatlParkService plans to address deferred maintenance in our national parks by opening up public lands to fossil fuel extraction- all while the oil and gas industry receives huge tax breaks. This approach is shortsighted and irresponsible. https://t.co/aniDWA5os6This is wrong. I'm voting no. https://t.co/bjGX8UOrGfOver the weekend, families on Kauai experienced devastating flooding. I spoke with Mayor Carvalho today to express my support &amp; aloha. https://t.co/IER9ChQ7yrIf the President is going to shift our mission in Syria, he needs to come to Congress for authorization and explain exactly what his strategy is, and how it supports U.S. national security interests and ends the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe and refugee crisis.I am deeply concerned by the President’s incoherent strategy in this critically important area of the world where there are layers of complexity and no easy answers.While today's action was taken in concert with France and Great Britain, the President stated that ‘we are prepared for a sustained response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.’Bashar al-Assad has again used chemical weapons against his own people. This is another atrocity and breach of international law, and the international community must hold him accountable.The fundamental difference between a democracy and a dictatorship is the rule of law, and @RealDonaldTrump's actions make clear that he has no respect for the rule of law. That's why Congress must act to protect the Special Counsel's investigation. https://t.co/46EWooSQbeThe gender pay gap puts women at a financial disadvantage from the beginning of their careers to retirement.

But Trump has appointed – and his Republican allies in the Senate have confirmed – regressive, dangerous, and extreme nominees who are undermining critical research.Over 6,500 hotels, malls, small businesses, apartments, and homes would be compromised or destroyed, and 20,000 residents would be displaced by a sea level rise.

The President chose to torpedo a bipartisan compromise to protect Dreamers. He created this mess. https://t.co/R9rSeN1x8gWith this threat, the President made it clear that he wanted all of us to stand with him against the Rounds-King amendment. That, I would not do.President Trump created this crisis when he cancelled DACA and threw 800,000 young people under the bus. And with his recent veto threat, he has made it abundantly clear that protecting Dreamers is the farthest thing from his mind.The Rounds-King amendment included a number of provisions I strongly oppose, including $25 billion for Trump’s wall. The Republicans also sought to dismantle our legal, family-based immigration system. Democrats fought hard to limit the damage.Unfortunately, we were left with only one option to protect the 800,000 current DACA recipients and an additional one million Dreamers who the President has threatened with deportation. It’s for them that I voted for the Rounds-King amendment.I have consistently supported a clean DREAM Act, and voted in favor of the Coons-McCain amendment today that came very close to it. And while it earned the support of a bipartisan group of 52 senators, the vast majority of Republicans blocked this effort.My family entered the middle class after my mom's workplace unionized. I stand with my @AFGENational brothers and sisters as we fight for fair pay and to protect the rights of federal workers. https://t.co/xexO3uyA82This week, we can come together to resolve the crisis Trump created when he canceled DACA.

Watch here: https://t.co/YaPVDBXBLl #ProtectDreamersWe're in this fight to #ProtectDreamers for young people like Getsy, Leonardo, Victor, and Yenima. All these extraordinary people are asking for is something we all want- a chance at the American Dream. Full video at https://t.co/MiaGOOnqXB https://t.co/6hHfIABJbEI voted against this legislation because Dreamers are not included in it. An overwhelming majority of the public supports legislation to protect Dreamers, and Democrats will be fighting hard for them during the upcoming debate on immigration.A lot of hard work and compromise went into this budget deal, which includes a number of provisions I strongly support. However, Dreamers were left out of the bill to allow this deal to go forward.Throughout the debate on government spending, I have consistently supported efforts to fund critical domestic priorities without pitting groups against one another.Today we celebrate National Girls &amp; Women in Sports Day &amp; young women like @ScoutBassett who keep striving #LikeAGirl every day. https://t.co/k4TLbXynt5February is American #HeartMonth &amp; the women of the Senate are coming together to raise awareness of heart health. Learn more at https://t.co/QaSaFAkAF3 #GoRedforWomen https://t.co/0CDEuffuNgThrough all the obfuscation and negative personal attacks, a clear pattern has emerged. The President and his Republican allies will do whatever they can to discredit the Mueller Russia investigation without respect or regard for the collateral damage caused. #DefendOurDemocracyI'm on the Senate Floor to #DefendOurDemocracy. Watch live here: https://t.co/yCvKrR15VH.Self-serving and personal attacks against people who refuse to do his bidding reflect the narcissism of a man who has little regard for his responsibilities as President. 
Sadly, for President Trump, it's all about him. Every time. All of the time.Many of the Republicans investigating Trump-Russia appear more concerned with protecting the President than getting to the truth, this is particularly true in the House where almost nothing happens on the Intel Committee without the assent of the White House. #DefendOurDemocracyReleasing a memo despite the FBI’s national security concerns shows how far Republicans will go to protect their lying President &amp; undermine Robert Mueller’s investigation..@realDonaldTrump's aversion to differences of opinion is pathological and does not serve our national interest or the interests of our allies in the region.That the White House is no longer considering Victor Cha’s nomination over his legitimate concerns about preemptive military strikes against North Korea is deeply troubling and undermines ongoing diplomatic efforts to deescalate tensions.My hot take on the #SOTU 🙄 https://t.co/tqDmw0PeCjFor all his talk of unity, @realDonaldTrump is highlighting again and again policies that divide our country. #SOTUTeleprompter Trump lies and sows fear about immigrants. There is no such thing as chain migration. It's called family reunification. #SOTUIf @realDonaldTrump truly cared about expanding health care access, he wouldn't have spent the past year trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. #SOTUI’m wearing my #TimesUp &amp; breaking the glass ceiling pins to the #SOTU to represent our fight for equality &amp; an end to sexual harassment. https://t.co/DbBGMuBjKaIn #AYearOfTrump, the President, and his proxies in the Federalist Society &amp; Heritage Foundation have chosen so many objectionable nominees for life tenured judicial positions because they intend for them to carry far-right beliefs to the bench.Disgusting. https://t.co/guul5GMS5BOur government has no place in the choice or anguish that accompanies women like Meredith's decision to have an abortion. #NoAbortionBan https://t.co/bwf4oVHqbq https://t.co/DVEYV9BefGSenate Republicans are making yet another harmful attempt to turn back the clock on women’s reproductive health care. @SenateDems are on the floor in opposition to these attacks on women's health. #NoAbortionBan https://t.co/0kbAT6i5rIMahalo to our fall semester Senate Pages, who graduated today. Pages work in the Senate for a semester &amp; are instrumental to keeping the Senate floor running. https://t.co/Y6zN8ccWFADonald Trump's latest immigration salvo demonstrates an ego unbound by fairness, compassion, or understanding. It’s reminiscent of how he bullied and mistreated others in his business dealings.Terms like "chain migration" and "illegals" continuously disrespect families like mine who came to this country in search of a better life.There is no institution that Donald Trump's minions won't attack to protect their lying President. Going after the FBI to protect the President is reckless and unconscionable. https://t.co/mlynjHFpj9There is no question that an open debate on immigration will be a knock-down, drag-out fight. There is an urgent need to protect DREAMers, and we can’t lose sight of this in the upcoming debate.At the same time, Mitch McConnell promised on the Senate floor today that he would hold an open debate on DACA and immigration if no compromise is reached by the time this CR ends on February 8. We should all expect the Majority Leader to honor this promise.My consistent position has been to oppose any continuing resolution that did not include these priorities. I voted against this CR for this reason.I’m confident that we can reach bipartisan agreement on these issues and it was completely unnecessary for the President and Congressional Republicans to force a shutdown on them.There are battles worth fighting. Protecting DREAMers, reauthorizing CHIP, funding Community Health Centers, and providing parity between funding for defense and domestic priorities – without pitting one against the other – were battles worth fighting.Congress shouldn’t wait around for the President to make up his mind. Let’s do our jobs and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/zoLOjByI4yWe're here in the Capitol fighting for #Dreamers, children, and families across the country. @SenatorDurbin &amp; I heard from some of these inspirational young people today. Their stories keep us going. https://t.co/1Ym7H55Pc5McConnell &amp; Ryan want to wait for @realDonaldTrump, but we are a separate branch of government. Let’s do our jobs and end the #TrumpShutdownCongress is a separate branch of government. Instead of bowing to the unpredictable, mercurial, and unreliable positions of the President, we should do our jobs and send the President a government funding bill that addresses all of these priorities.Republicans are in charge of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. They are in charge of setting the time table and the agenda, and now they’re blaming the Democrats for their own misplaced priorities.At the same time, they’ve ignored reauthorizing CHIP, funding Community Health Centers, protecting DREAMers, and providing parity between defense and non-defense programs. All of these issues have bipartisan support and should have gotten done months ago.Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, &amp; Donald Trump turned things upside down. They’ve spent the past year working behind closed doors to take away health care from millions &amp; pass huge tax cuts for the richest people &amp; corporations in our country without input from Dems or the public.The people, united, will never be defeated. We don't want a #TrumpShutdown, but we won't allow Republicans to pit vulnerable communities like these brave #Dreamers against each other. https://t.co/dkhyGPTqUYIt is a no-brainer. Let's do both. https://t.co/MVlAIvLgy8The Senate is now in session &amp; @SenateDems continue to be ready to negotiate a bipartisan deal. But we will not pit kids against kids by allowing GOP to hold 9 million children who rely on CHIP hostage. #TrumpShutdownRather than negotiating in good faith with Democrats to prevent a government shutdown, Republicans believe they can pull the wool over the eyes of the American people. https://t.co/geFOxdUvpTThis is a pivotal moment for Congress. Are we going to do more than pay lip service to DREAMers by doing our jobs to protect them and provide health care to millions of children and families across the country? Or are we going to bend to the whims of an unpredictable President? https://t.co/OeqvUV8LC8I will be voting no on the House CR because it does not include protections for Dreamers, funding for the Children’s Health Insurance program and Community Health Centers, and parity between defense and domestic spending. https://t.co/sU9iVzGf0RIt is crucial that the people of HI can have confidence in the government as an institution to provide accurate information.

Dr. King's words ring truer than ever. https://t.co/fBVKtm2FQDYesterday, I spoke with Governor David Ige, Hawaii EMA Director Vern Miyagi, Adjutant General Joe Logan, &amp; Admiral Harry Harris to make sure something like this never happens again. While the alert was false, the fear and panic Hawaii residents &amp; visitors felt was real. https://t.co/7q5UAhG32dToday’s alert was a false alarm. At a time of heightened tensions, we need to make sure all information released to the community is accurate. We need to get to the bottom of what happened and make sure it never happens again.I will continue to defend the Senate’s Constitutional obligation to provide advice &amp; consent on lifetime appointees to the federal bench. Until we return to a normal process through which we can provide it, I will oppose invoking cloture on any judicial nominee. https://t.co/EyqDcBoi8n@PattyMurray @SecretaryZinke I couldn’t agree more @PattyMurray -  families in Hawaii rely on our clean shores and water for not only their livelihood, but our way of life. We must protect our coasts from Secretary Zinke and the Trump administration. https://t.co/tA2C5ATUBpEvery day, DREAMers like Victor have been sharing their stories in the halls of the Senate in order to stay in the country they call home.

That’s bad math for families in Hawaii. https://t.co/tV2FqQn7w4It is nothing more than a fulfillment of the Republican Party’s mission to eventually gut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest Americans and corporations. The American people will hold them accountable.The Republican tax bill is a scam. After months of empty promises to the middle class, the President has been caught in another big fat lie. This bill will not help the middle class.Tonight, the Senate is voting on the #GOPTaxScam- Donald Trump's big, fat lie to the middle class &amp; giveaway to the top 1% and corporations. https://t.co/l3bjuFYvRRIf you're in the top 1% of the wealthiest in our country, you'll do great under the #GOPTaxScam.

Instead of doing anything that would actually help people, Republicans want to give huge tax cuts to the rich.

We can only create a culture where women are respected as equals if we all step forward and be part of the change by holding everyone, especially our leaders, accountable.My hope is that this moment for a cultural change will result in women no longer being viewed as objects or toys, but recognized for their abilities and achievements. As regular human beings. Women have endured this behavior, which for too long has been ignored and tolerated.We are, all of us, speaking out, naming names and demanding that the harassers take responsibility for their behavior. I am proud of each of the women who has come forward, and heartened by the changing climate that has received their stories with acceptance and compassion.TIME Magazine, by naming ‘The Silence Breakers’ as their ‘People of the Year,’ is recognizing what women have always known: there are men among us who use their positions of power and influence to manipulate, harass, and assault women. What is new here is the women.Today, I am calling on my colleague Al Franken to step aside. I’ve struggled with this decision because he’s been a good Senator and I consider him a friend.
