I stand with those marching in #Andover, #Haverhill, #Lunenburg, and elsewhere across the Commonwealth tomorrow in support of immigrant families separated at the border #KeepFamiliesTogether
https://t.co/5ptMOutr5EAs Mr. Pike stressed, offshore wind presents a rare opportunity to establish a new industry in the United States – one that provides cost-effective clean renewable energy, economic development, and jobs.This week, I invited Stephen Pike, CEO of @MassCEC, to testify in favor of my bill, the Offshore Wind Jobs and Opportunity Act, before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. You can watch our exchange here: https://t.co/hO1Vd3G4qYYesterday, I sat down with Benen O’Brien with @cspan’s @BookTV to discuss what books are on my summer reading list. My growing list is full of mystery novels, but I am always open to new suggestions. What is on your reading list this summer? https://t.co/Avz9IMlnG2Although it’s cloudy in #MA3 and on Capitol Hill today, it’s never a bad idea to have your favorite pair of sunglasses at the ready to protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. Happy #NationalSunglassesDay! https://t.co/hCHPerJl4ZJerry Shu, a rising sophomore at @phillipsacademy #Andover, stopped by my office w/his family before today’s #CongressionalArtCompetition reception. Jerry’s drawing, “Cracked,” is currently on display in the Capitol as this year’s #MA3 winner of the CAC. Congrats, Jerry! https://t.co/rm4WUh18gSWe will channel their determination, their dignity &amp; their spirit of unity as we resist this #Janus decision &amp; carry their fight forward.I’m thinking of the women who led the landmark Bread &amp; Roses strike of 1912 in #Lawrence &amp; drew attention to the problems of child labor, dangerous workplace conditions, &amp; the unequal distribution of the profits of industry.Today’s #SCOTUS decision will void thousands of #union contracts &amp; impact millions of workers. While the #Janus decision is a setback, our fight is not over.#NationalCanoeDay and #GreatOutdoorsMonth is the perfect time to remind everyone that #MA3 has some of the best waterways for canoeing &amp; recreation in New England. Check out this great shot when my family &amp;  I went canoeing on the Nashua River in #Devens during River Day last yr. https://t.co/3ckEKgrkBT3 years ago today, marriage equality became the law of the land. Today, our work is far from over. On Equality Day, I urge my colleagues to pass the #EqualityAct to provide clear and consistent protections for #LGBTQ people across the United States. #EqualityForward https://t.co/8VrGLKlLuLToday’s #SCOTUS decisions made alarmingly clear that elections have consequences. We cannot take our most sacred American values for granted. We have to fight for them and we have to defend them. #NoMuslimBanEver #NIFLAvBecerra #CourtsMatterMy bill, the Offshore Wind Jobs and Opportunity Act, would create a new federal grant program to educate and train a new generation of American offshore wind workers to fill these well-paying jobs created from harnessing this offshore wind capacity and move our economy forward.According to the @ENERGY, if we used even 1% of the nation’s technical potential offshore wind capacity, it could power nearly 6.5 million homes. https://t.co/QAU5p0PRwX"I look forward to the discussion on how we can advance our nation’s energy independence and support new energy jobs through offshore wind.""We also have a number of MA offshore wind industry leaders, including senior leadership from @nbwindenergy, the Center for Wind Energy @UMassLowell, @IBEW Local 223, and @NewBedfordArea.""We have a broad coalition of organizations supporting the legislation, including @The_UWUA, @AWEA, @BGAlliance, @steelworkers, @NWF, &amp; @SierraClub.""States like MA are investing their own resources &amp; working w/industry to support offshore wind workforce training. MA released the Offshore Wind Workforce Assessment which identifies what types of workforce training &amp; education progs are needed to fill offshore wind jobs.""Offshore wind has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs &amp; make the US a global industry leader. But we can’t just be investing in energy technologies, we need to be investing in our people who will bring these technologies out of the lab &amp; into our homes&amp;businesses.""To realize the full potential of our nation’s offshore wind resources, we must make sure that a full cadre of American workers are trained and ready to pave the way for growth and innovation in this rapidly growing industry.""Our nation is in the midst of a clean energy revolution. Increasingly, more of our electricity is being generated by renewable energy–as much as 22 percent in 2017–and we are only beginning to utilize one of our great untapped renewable resources: offshore wind."This morning, my bill, the Offshore Wind Jobs &amp; Opportunity Act, will have a hearing before the Subcommittee on Energy &amp; Mineral Resources. We’re excited to have Stephen Pike, CEO of @MassCEC, testify in favor of this legislation. Watch live at 10am: https://t.co/Nzbkbpffk5Five years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but there is a solution. Today, I’m urging Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.The Trump administration still has not outlined a plan for reuniting the more than 2,300 young children separated from their families at the border. Children belong with their families. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/4V5RkBTPKm#MA3 museums include the @ConcordMuseum, the New England Quilt Museum in #Lowell, the @DiscoveryActon Museum, the @fitchburgart Museum, the @mrussianicons in #Clinton, the Fort Devens Museum, the @fruitlands Museum in #Harvard, and The Old Manse in #ConcordToday is officially the 1st Friday of summer, but next Friday marks the kickoff of Free Fun Fridays-a program sponsored by @HighlandStreet that offers visitors free admission to many of the most treasured cultural venues in MA on Fridays this summer https://t.co/g7F9DiyaqLWhile votes are wrapping up here on Capitol Hill, Cliff (who belongs to my district staffer Jane Adams) is busy holding down the fort in my #Lowell district office on National #TakeYourDogToWorkDay. He makes up for a lack of thumbs with a good “woof” ethic. #mapoliwithanimals https://t.co/Cz72ka7yvaThese are just 2 of the more than 2,300 heartbreaking stories of immigrant children separated from families at the border that I highlighted this morning. The Trump adm must immediately outline their plan to reunite these loved ones. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/2n60jiErhBCongrats to Cameron Friend of #Acton &amp; Aiden Snorek-Yates of #Carlisle for earning The Congressional Award Gold Medal! Cameron&amp;Aiden had to set&amp;surpass personal goals in 4 program areas: Voluntary Public Service, Personal Development, Physical Fitness, and Expedition/Exploration. https://t.co/9rDHRpIWV3I will continue to fight for Joe, Pamela, Lin, and the tens of thousands of people in #MA3 and across Massachusetts who rely on the #ACA for quality health care. #ProtectOurCareThe Trump administration is once again sewing uncertainty in the minds of people like Joe, Pamela, and Lin, urging a federal court to strike down the #ACA’s provisions preventing insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more for pre-existing conditions.Joe, Pamela, and Lin are just a few of the over 2.9 million Bay Staters &amp; 130 million Americans w/pre-existing medical conditions who would be at risk of losing their health care if protections for people with pre-existing conditions were taken away.Lin from #Stow wrote, “Having had cancer [two times], I am afraid that insurance companies will use every loophole possible to not cover pre-existing conditions."Pamela from #Stow has a niece and a nephew who were each born w/a rare genetic disease, both of whom would have been denied insurance coverage before the #ACA made it illegal to deny coverage for preexisting conditions.Thanks to #ACA, Joe from #Andover, who has prostate cancer, was able to buy ins. for him&amp;his family after COBRA benefits expired. Joe said this when the GOP initiated repeal efforts: “I need to know whether I'll be able to get coverage in the future? And if so, at what cost?"Last yr, when the future of the #ACA was in doubt, I reached out to constituents in #MA3 &amp;asked what repealing health care would mean to them. I received replies from anxious spouses&amp;parents who feared the uncertainty of their coverage, esp. from those w/pre-existing conditions.Knowing that there are more than 2,300 similarly unthinkable stories, the Trump administration must immediately outline how they will reunite these loved ones, and bring the terror and trauma they are experiencing to an end. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThe unimaginable story of a mother and two-year-old daughter separated at the border is detailed in this article by a well-respected photo-journalist.   https://t.co/IfUYEUZ4R2This afternoon, I stood w/@HouseDemocrats to demand that @realDonaldTrump end his cruel policy of separating families at the border. We must continue to raise our collective voices to put pressure on President Trump to rescind this policy of his own making #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/UzuKRrBu4eCongress must send a strong message that the U.S - a country whose story has been written by those fleeing oppression&amp;hardship – won't abandon the world’s most vulnerable populations. On #WorldRefugeeDay, I join my colleagues to affirm our nation’s commitment to protect refugees.However, the President could end this humanitarian crisis with one phone call. @realDonaldTrump , end this policy. #KeepFamiliesTogetherI have signed on as a co-sponsor to the #KeepFamilesTogether Act in the House, legislation that would prohibit the @DHSgov from separating families at the border and would offer protections for immigrants seeking asylum in the United States.Since the President is unwilling to reverse his “zero-tolerance” policy, Democrats are using every tool democracy has to offer to prevent immigrant children from being separated from their families at the border.

https://t.co/MH9JSaxy8JForced family separation is not only traumatic for children&amp;their families, but it has a long-lasting effect on the psych well-being of these children. @AmerAcadPeds, @ACPinternists,@APAPsychiatric,&amp;over 7,700 mental health pros agree #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/BXtSBCPP2jWith our leading universities, research institutes, &amp; cutting-edge industries in the life sciences, robotics, and biomedicine, MA is the ideal home for a command dedicated to procuring the  platforms needed to keep the Army at the forefront of innovation in the  21st century.This afternoon, I joined @MassGovernor, Undersecretary of the @USArmy Ryan McCarthy, sr Army officials,+ innovation leaders for a roundtable discussion about the benefits of locating the headquarters of the Army’s Futures &amp; Modernization Command in the Boston area. https://t.co/zBMtXQoTS7Good luck to the @LowellSpinners as they take on the @SIYanks tonight in their 21st home opener at LaLacheur Park and their 23rd season in #Lowell! https://t.co/cqP5zF7WkbI fully agree with her and the important points she makes.  We must continue to amplify voices like hers to send an unmistakable message to this White House.  #KeepFamiliesTogether 2/2First Lady @laurawbush wrote a compelling piece in the @WaPo this wknd. “In 2018, can we not as a nation find a kinder, more compassionate and more moral answer to this current crisis?

One of them was Joe from #Andover.

That's why I offered an amendment on the House floor to modestly increase funding for offshore wind job training grants. https://t.co/8YmepktwHp.@FloorCharts on my way to the House floor to stand up for offshore wind job training

Mass. receives $9 million in critical #TitleX funding for over 90 health centers in the Commonwealth including several facilities in my district.#TitleX is the only federal program dedicated to providing women (and men) with comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services that help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies each year and improve women’s health.If you care about issues like SS, Medicare, the enviroment, gun safety,&amp;vets’ benefits, then you care about the #GOPClosedCongress.

The consequences of walking away from this deal cannot be underestimated.The #IranDeal is a collective international agreement that saw the United States along with China, Russia, France, the U.K.,+Germany put aside their differences in order to address a shared+singular goal: blocking Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Check out @boston25’s latest series, “Crossroads,” which profiles #Lowell in the program’s first episode. I sat down w/@StephanieCNews to discuss how the Mill City is positioning itself as an economic, cultural,+educational leader in MA+New England: https://t.co/H8QhgCEL6sThankfully, because of your calls and your activism (over 99% of calls to my office were opposed to #Trumpcare at the time), the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land.Today marks one year since the @HouseGOP forced a vote on #Trumpcare, a plan that would have ripped away healthcare from millions, raised premiums, and cut care for children, seniors, veterans, and those with pre-existing conditions.I joined many remarkable women from Greater Boston who serve in the national security sector for @WIDNational's meeting in #Westford.

https://t.co/tr2cRRjlx18 years ago today, millions of gallons of crude oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico, causing lasting harm to wildlife, natural areas,+the overall Gulf economy.

We honor them by telling their stories and by standing up to injustice, hatred, and persecution wherever it exists. #NeverAgain https://t.co/sgjhfTBz4vThis amendment is not about budgeting or balance – it’s an attack on working families, seniors, vets, and the poor. I will be voting no on this amendment.Today, @SpeakerRyan and @HouseGOP are forcing a vote – a vote many within their own Party don’t want to take – on a “so-called” balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. A yes vote means drastic cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. https://t.co/t2LU8AkZzMNews this week that a fed judge upheld MA’s assault weapons ban is good, but @LowellSunNews makes a strong point: Congress must pass laws on the fed level that compel every state to follow the same rules. https://t.co/Kj9mlskwyUWe should not be making near-term decisions with long-term consequences without Congress robustly debating the serious questions this situation raises.

He should resign immediately. #BootPruitt https://t.co/vAjhkyKsC8Congratulations to my friend and colleague @RepMcGovern who we are fortunate to have assuming this meaningful role. https://t.co/ITdwEdxcgZLet’s make this the last #EqualPayDayWe’ve come a long way in the past 40 years on #equalpay – including the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act – but there is still more work  to be done. It’s on all of us: lawmakers, employers,&amp;workers to close the gender &amp; racial #paygap.The #PaycheckFairnessAct is part of the solution for #equalpay, but we also must continue the fight on important issues like paid family leave and affordable childcare to help to close the wage gap.Wage inequality is not just a women’s issue. It's an issue that affects every family in all corners of our district+our nation. That's why I'm proud to co-sponsor the #PaycheckFairnessAct, legislation that seeks to ensure that women are paid the same as men for doing the same jobHowever, for women of color, the gap is far wider: Black women have to work 250 extra days to catch up; Native women, 270 days; and Latina women, 305 days.Did you know that women must work an average of 15 months to earn what men earn in 12 months? Today is #EqualPayDay, a day that symbolizes how far into 2018 women must work – 100 days – to earn what men were paid in 2017 alone. https://t.co/pT0LRJ7231Right now, you can still apply to renew your DACA.

His undeterred courage and his searingly eloquent message of our universal humanity were not only timely but they are timeless as well. #MLK50He continued: “Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination. And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be. We have an opportunity to make America a better nation.” #MLK50The night before his death, in what would be his last sermon at Memphis’s Mason Temple, he told those assembled to “develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness” by marching in solidarity with the sanitation workers. #MLK5050 years ago tonight, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was in the city to stand with striking sanitation workers who were protesting low wages, racial discrimination, and adverse working conditions. #MLK50Captain Hudner later served as Commissioner for the Massachusetts Department of Veterans’ Services after retiring from the Navy.

- @LowellSunNews @rsobeyLSunCongress has a responsibility to ensure that instances of misconduct, especially by those at the highest ranks, are investigated properly and that those who report these offenses are protected.  Watch my full statement &amp; questions: https://t.co/ag1e3M05s9 3/3The military is a rightly honored institution.  We would not be the country we are without it. But it is not perfect. 2/3This morning the Military Personnel Subcommittee heard testimony from Inspector Generals from each service branch and the DOD on the process for receiving complaints against senior military leaders &amp; how they investigate complaints. 1/3Yesterdays hearing w @RepMikeTurner cont. our focus on life threatening flaws in military aircraft – the frequency of which have grounded certain flight operations. We owe it to our pilots to make sure the planes they are flying are safe. My full statement https://t.co/WsDqBhhoVsThis bipartisan bill was influenced by the lessons learned by the military when working to combat sexual assault. Read more about these systemic changes in my @CNNOpinion op ed w/ @RepMikeTurner 2/2Today's passage of legislation to reform how sexual harassment is handled in Congress is a step forward. But we need to continue to say #TimesUp for all workplaces 1/2Great meeting with representatives from @MassLeague to discuss the importance of funding community health centers, which provide affordable, accessible, &amp; quality health care to patients across the US, regardless of their ability to pay. @NEWHealthBoston @EBNHC @lowell_chc https://t.co/Ye7WQYfbkGFYI – The Bedford VA will hold enrollment hours at its Haverhill Community Based Outpatient Clinic (108 Merrimack St, Haverhill) on 2/7, 2/21, 3/7 and 3/21 from 9 AM to 3 PM.Today I cosponsored the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act. I urge Republican Leadership to bring this and other legislation to the floor to prevent the President from undermining Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation.This Dominican Heritage Month we recognize those of Dominican heritage for all they do to enrich the #ThirdDistrict, which is made better thanks to the diversity of our communities.Let’s go @Patriots - #NotDoneThis graphic sadly says a lot about our nation’s current priorities. #CHCF

By @sarahkliff https://t.co/f3HZ8QEOZuThis American #HeartMonth, help spread the word and raise awareness to prevent heart disease! https://t.co/EaKcVQIKM0#BlackHistoryMonth is an opportunity to celebrate how profoundly black history has shaped American history.  Recognizing the importance of this history will help challenge future generations to do the best each of us can in our lives to move the needle of progress.“While every institution must wrestle with how best to change its culture and do right by victims...systemic changes in the military have had an impact” 
- my @CNNOpinion w/ @RepMikeTurner on why the military’s long reckoning with sexual assault can help us now #MST #MeToo  
@CNNTheir presence at this speech serves as an imposing counterweight to the President’s attempt to put a positive spin on his first year in office.  And, their stories, from their perspective, deserve to be heard and shared and amplified. 3/3 https://t.co/nkxVZroqSJI was encouraged and heartened by the more than 100 ppl who attended the speech at the invitation of my Democratic colleagues to ensure that the President’s message is not the only message delivered tonight. 2/3I was deeply skeptical that POTUS could restore trust in his admin and renew a meaningful dialogue on pressing issues.  The absence of concrete proposals, with yet another looming deadline next week, and doubling down on divisive rhetoric, did not assuage that skepticism. 1/3.@RepJoeKennedy remarkably represented the Commonwealth and our nation tonight.  A message of hope and unity that so many of us share, and a forceful counter to the #SOTUCongress must ensure military has  resources &amp; tools it needs to protect the American people and well prepare those who serve on our behalf. But our nat sec is being put at risk if we undermine all other investments in our nat competitiveness and the future of our country. #SOTUI encourage the President to continue to focus his efforts on further funding resources to address the devastating impact of opioid abuse and addiction. #SOTUThe scourge of opioid abuse and addiction is widespread throughout the nation with rural, suburban, and urban communities all feeling the impacts. I appreciate the President’s attention to this important issue, including his support for my bipartisan INTERDICT Act. #SOTU
