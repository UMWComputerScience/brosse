Almost 60% of New Mexicans in rural communities and 80% in tribal communities don’t have access to high-speed broadband. I’ve made it my priority to address this imbalance because I believe bridging the digital divide is critical to our economy, our students, and our nation.Together, we participated in a demonstration of Google’s #RollingStudyHalls, a broadband roundtable discussion, a conversation about the digital divide in New Mexico, and toured Santo Domingo Library and New Mexico State Library https://t.co/u3r0kxjPVkThank you to Commissioner Rosenworcel and all of the knowledgeable participants who were willing to meet today to discuss how we bring broadband access to New Mexico and the whole country.Technology is an integral part of students’ learning in the 21st century. I'm proud to introduce legislation with @PeterWelch to turn students’ long commutes into time spent learning. https://t.co/b4stR2poQjThey have failed again and again to protect children. Congress could have taken action to meaningfully protect children and keep families together. Congress didn’t. Speaker Ryan even blocked a vote on bipartisan legislation to protect Dreamers. Roger and Lea deserve better.Just last week I was in Brownsville, TX meeting Roger &amp; Lea, babies who'd been torn from their families by the President's immoral family separation policy. The President caused this problem and he has not fixed it. Speaker Ryan and Republican leadership have done no better.It is a betrayal of our founding principles to rip families apart, build walls and hide from the world. As a nation – as men and women of compassion – we must reject policies that divide us. 

Read my op-ed in the Albuquerque Journal: https://t.co/yAxCtOnJFTI'm proud we were able to work together on the bipartisan HR 6, which contains several bills I worked on to help combat the opioid crisis. https://t.co/dw0dY4NsdSNew Mexican working families, farmers and ranchers, and rural communities all depend on the Farm Bill. The bill Congressional Republicans passed, and I opposed, makes it more likely that children and working families will go to bed hungry. https://t.co/ZixG7E59nNWe need the administration to fix what they created. The concern that so many people have across the country, and that I share, is that the administration will ignore the children that have been separated and are still detained today. https://t.co/qq2W5FekXqWhen I visited Texas, I met baby Roger and Baby Lea, who had been taken from their families. It was heartbreaking. https://t.co/PEHsDQkfhSI’m standing with my colleagues on the steps of the US Capitol to demand that President Trump end this heartless policy now. #EndFamilySeparation #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/5YRWRHs9VgIf there’s a little something left in the president’s heart, if he maybe embraced one of these babies, it might help him make the right decision and end these policies of separating babies from their moms. #KeepFamilesTogether #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/XoxhiIqfIxMr. President, if you're watching, if you're listening like I know that you do, pick up the phone and stop this. #EndFamilySeparation #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/TsJSt4POefHAPPENING SOON: I’ll be live on @MSNBC to talk about my visit to two detention facilities for immigrant children. #KeepFamilesTogether #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/GBSW0y0FC8As a nation—as men and women of compassion—we cannot stand by while mothers literally have their children torn from them. #EndFamilySeparation #KeepFamilesTogetherThere is simply no good reason for taking these children from their parents. #EndFamilySeparation #KeepFamilesTogetherHAPPENING NOW: I’m participating in a round table on family separation. #EndFamilySeparation #KeepFamiliesTogether Watch live here: https://t.co/2A33HVhKsBMy bill to establish a grant program to fund opioid centers across the country passed the House of Representatives this week. The treatment centers created by this legislation will be located in areas hit hardest by this epidemic and they will serve those who need help the most. https://t.co/CtpaELsek3While pursuing diplomacy with North Korea is necessary, if the President is serious about these efforts, he has an obligation to work with our allies to form a clear strategy toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.I believe it's our responsibility to pursue peace through diplomacy whenever possible. However, President Trump has given legitimacy to a regime with a disgraceful human rights record and handed Kim Jong-Un broad concessions without consulting our partners in the region.This week, my Better Pain Management Through Better Data Act passed the House. It's an important step in making sure everyone has more options to treat pain. If we’re going to really stop this epidemic, we have to make sure everyone has access to non-addictive pain medication. https://t.co/s2NHZLnNmPThe administration has slammed the door on innocent victims in a cruel attempt to score political points with their base and further demonize immigrants coming to the United States to seek a better life.President Trump and Attorney General Sessions are condemning tens of thousands of families to lives of violence and possibly even death. This heartless decision by the Trump administration is a betrayal of the founding principles of our nation. https://t.co/YnnLVhRR0AToday, the @FCC’s #NetNeutrality repeal goes into effect, but the fight for a free and open internet continues. I'm one of 170 members of Congress calling for a vote in the House to #SaveTheInternet.#ImmigrantHeritageMonth is a time to remember that America was founded by immigrants seeking a better life for themselves and future generations.

It was also important to get facts on how much revenue NM is losing by flaring methane, and ask why there is little to no process for public comment and notice. @NRDems https://t.co/PpXDNE8SIlI asked @EPAScottPruitt about lobbyists organizing his travel and his abuse of gift rules when he testified before @EnergyCommerce. His answers were misleading so I followed up with a letter and requested a response by 5/30. He hasn't replied. https://t.co/rdhQVcKghNThank you to all the brave men and women working to contain the #UteParkFire! https://t.co/yJR04jvMCrWater is life in New Mexico. We depend on it for drinking &amp; irrigation but Scott Pruitt wants to dismantle protections for our vital resources. This is bad for NM and we can’t let it continue. We must protect our water for those who depend on it. #PeopleNotPolluters #BootPruittI stand with the American public in support of a free and open internet.

As farmers are getting a 15 year low on the farm dollar, we must build on programs like the VAPG. See the @USDA report. https://t.co/ekZkNaY7PaBy ensuring this vital program is funded and by streamlining the application process, we can provide stability for our state’s agricultural producers and create more opportunities for them to sell their distinct products.An integral part of New Mexico’s economy is the hard work of our farmers and producers across the state. Our crops are part of the fabric of our state. That's why I introduced the Growing Value Added Economies Act which bolster’s USDA's VAPG program. https://t.co/l5NuuP25DoWatch video of the reveal on Facebook here #CongressionalArtCompetition https://t.co/jPAbOd4BncThis weekend I revealed the winner of the #CongressionalArtCompetition as Carolina Trujillo, a Senior at New Mexico School for the Arts.

He is the EPA Administrator and is ultimately responsible for the ethical violations, the scandals, and disastrous policy proposals put forth by the EPA. https://t.co/5WHAm0anXoIn today’s economy, internet access is a necessity for entrepreneurs, students, and families. Unfortunately, too many communities lack access to broadband. The #TribalConnect Act will help bridge this digital divide in Indian Country. https://t.co/vP0RMtraJxI guess the buck doesn’t stop with him, it starts with him. #carpooling https://t.co/IsOOqgm23MToday, I asked @EPAScottPruitt if he runs the EPA. It was a harder question than I expected. https://t.co/rU04KGWFDhThe case can’t be more clear, @EPAScottPruitt has mismanaged the agency, is mired in scandals and ethics violations, and continues to push policies that are anti-science, anti-environment, and that damage the health of the public. He must resign or be removed. #BootPruittWithin the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument in New Mexico are elk, deer, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, birds of prey, and otters. Here were some bighorn sheep on my way home from #SaveRGDN on Monday! https://t.co/kuirwXsQbNLike many of you, I grew up learning about everything from math to grammar and civics with the help of #SchoolhouseRock. Thank you, Bob Dorough, for changing how an entire generation of students learned. May he rest in peace.The decision to designate the Río Grande del Norte a National Monument was strongly supported by New Mexicans. This legislation would now provide the Cerro del Yuta and Río San Antonio areas the highest level of protection from the Federal government. #SaveRGDN #OurWildNational parks &amp; public lands help define who we are as a nation. That's why I introduced a bill to establish two new wilderness areas within Río Grande del Norte National Monument. #SaveRGDN #OurWildMy thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and his fellow Code Talkers, who have lost another brother in arms.  Ahee’hee’, thank you, Roy for your service and honoring us with your gift.Though we know him to be a hero, Roy was a humble man who frequently downplayed his role in the war.  As we mourn the loss of Roy, we also reflect on his legacy and the legacy of all Navajo Code Talkers.I was saddened to learn of the passing of Roy Hawthorne, one of the last remaining Navajo Code Talkers. After enlisting at 17, Roy served as a Code Talker during WWII, using his language to form an unbreakable code that was essential to the Allied forces’ strategy to win the war.Happy #EarthDay!

That's why I joined 106 of my House &amp; Senate Colleagues in opposing the rescission of the rule, requesting a longer comment period &amp; requesting that @Interior hold public hearings.When the Methane Waste Prevention Rule was developed @Interior held more than a half dozen hearings, including in NM. For the rescission under Zinke none have been held. This is deeply concerning and represents a clear departure from how public policy should be made. #CutMethane.@EPAPruitt’s secrecy, waste of taxpayer money and widespread conflicts of interest are unacceptable. Pruitt's unethical actions put the health and safety of Americans at risk. Today, I joined over 130 colleagues in introducing a resolution calling for his resignation.#BootPruittRepublicans and Democrats agree— it’s time to find a legislative solution for #Dreamers. Despite this, the House has not been allowed to vote on this issue. These young people have waited long enough. #GiveUsAVoteAll communities benefit from #SNAP. It's a critical program that 40 million Americans count on to lift themselves families out of poverty. In fact, in 2015, SNAP lifted at least 1.2 million Latinos out of poverty. Cutting #SNAP would be detrimental to this progress. #protectSNAPJennifer Riordan’s loss will be felt deeply across our state. Her philanthropy, leadership &amp; love for her community touched all those around her and she made NM a better place. She will be missed. Jennifer’s husband &amp; her 2 children are in my thoughts during this difficult time.First Lady Barbara Bush was a passionate advocate, tireless public servant, Navy wife, and a loving mother and grandmother. I send my deepest prayers and sympathies to the Bush family.We needed tax reform that prioritized middle class families. Unfortunately, the #GOPTaxScam gave 83% of the tax cuts to the top 1%, exploded the deficit and stuck our children with the bill. #TaxDay https://t.co/8VophuE8AHWe are all praying for Barbara Bush and her family. An incredible person who’s faith and love of people is an example to us all.Possibly the most destructive action taken by @EPAScottPruitt is the degradation of the role of science at @EPA in protecting public health and the environment. His "secret science" plan is the capstone of this effort. #BootPruitt https://t.co/4e0n8QkUEC #MarchForScienceThis week, @EPA removed a military veteran and career civil servant for approving an internal report that undermined @EPAScottPruitt's justification for extravagant security expenses. This is deeply concerning and another reason to #BootPruitt. Mario, thank you for your service.President Trump's threats to fire Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein are a disgrace and a blatant attempt to obstruct the Special Counsel's investigation. Robert Mueller must be allowed to complete his work without interference or intimidation. The American people deserve the truth.I’ll be speaking live at a @Campaign4Kids and @CPAG_USA briefing on child poverty. #ValueOurKids https://t.co/Y75sFct9X3There is a rapidly growing list of reasons EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt should resign- just one of them is that he demotes EPA officials who try to raise concerns about his outrageous spending and mismanagement. #BootPruittYou can read more about Facebook’s “shadow profiles” here. I look forward to hearing back from Mr. Zuckerberg later on how much data Facebook collects on non-users. https://t.co/AUF09YIZq7Facebook has profiles on people who have never even signed up for a Facebook page. If you’re among them, to see what data they've collected, first you have to create a Facebook page!

He insists on travelling first class and racked up over $168,000 in air travel in just his first year in office. It's time for Pruitt to resign. #BootPruittThe wage gap is even more egregious for women of color: black women earn only 63 cents per dollar, Native American women earn 57 cents, and Latinas earn just 54 cents for every dollar earned by a white man. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/b18TnFI0DcAt this rate, if Congress doesn't act, women won't see pay equity until 2119. It's time for Congress to pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct to strengthen and closes loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act. #EqualPayDayToday, almost three months into the year, women’s wages finally catch up to what men were paid in 2017. Women working full-time, year-round still earn only 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. #EqualPayDayMore than 600 acres have been added to the Rio Grande del Norte monument! I proudly supported its designation as a national monument and funding for this expansion. Rio Grande del Norte is a treasure of northern NM that must be protected and preserved for future generations.Congratulations to @SenDuckworth on the birth of her daughter, Maile! She just became the first sitting Senator to have a baby in office - breaking yet another glass ceiling for women and mothers. I wish Senator Duckworth and her entire family my best during this happy time.Today, I joined 64 of my colleagues calling for the resignation or firing of Scott Pruitt. His unethical behavior, wasteful use of taxpayer money, and efforts to undermine the EPA’s mission to protect our environment and public health demand a response: he must go. #BootPruitt.@EPAScottPruitt’s tenure at the EPA has led to a disturbing trend of ethics violations and flagrant conflicts of interest.

If we don't examine what went wrong it will be impossible to prevent the same type of foreign interference in future elections.

This contradicts the firm conclusions of the entire U.S. Intelligence Community.The American people deserve a full accounting of Russian interference in our election. The House Republicans’ decision to prematurely close the House Intelligence Committee's investigation is a politically motivated attempt suppress the truth.Wanted to share my op-ed from the Santa Fe New Mexican this weekend.

I support commonsense measures to ensure that our children no longer go to school— or a library, movie theater, or concert—scared for their safety.Too often senseless acts of gun violence have shaken our nation. From Sandy Hook to Parkland to Aztec these tragedies impact people from all walks of life, every corner of our county, and right here in New Mexico. #NeverAgainI cosponsored legislation by @USRepMikeDoyle to preserve a free and open internet and overturn the FCC's decision to repeal #netneutrality protections.

I led a bipartisan coalition that passed legislation providing $1 billion for 2 years to help with prevention/ treatment-$10 million to NM. This $ is helpful, but those on the front lines say it’s just a start, so I introduced new bill to fund 5 more years.President Trump can try to paint himself as the greatest President ever, but firings, resignations, investigations and scandal after scandal have been far too common. At the highest levels, the Trump administration – and the business of the nation – has been seriously hurt. #SOTUAPD Officer Ryan Holets is a hero. New Mexico is proud to have him. #SOTU https://t.co/xzYMHGTAXSPresident Trump’s words may bring more awareness to opioid addiction, but words are not enough. The President must get serious about addressing this issue - provide new funding and new treatment/prevention strategies. #SOTUTrump’s immigration plan isn’t compromise but it compromises the American values on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore ... I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” #SOTUDACA enabled nearly 800,000 talented young people like Laura from NM to contribute more fully to this country. #DreamActNow #SOTU https://t.co/sQUVYkuoKFPresident Trump should meet with Dreamers.

It will increase your family’s health premiums &amp; gives new tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas. #SOTUPresident Trump is praising a #GOPTaxScam that gave 83.1% of the benefits to corporations and the wealthiest one percent of Americans and just 16.9% of the benefits to everyone else.
