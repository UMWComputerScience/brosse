Portland Forever. @chelliepingree #oneportland #rctid #beatseattle #SEAvPOR https://t.co/NYj6qdfmsVTrump perpetrated a human rights violation. Families ripped apart. Kids detained in cages. No plan to bring them back together. 

This crisis is NOT over. 

Demand an end to Trump's cruel policies. Families fleeing persecution should NOT be criminalized. #FamiliesBelongTogetherCollege World Series Champions! #GoBeavs.@repmarkpocan &amp; I have legislation to #AbolishICE. It's time we start over &amp; restore a more humane and service-oriented immigration system that treats ALL people with dignity &amp; respect. 

RT if you agree.This is a blow. Trump will only nominate another far right, inflexible, mindless partisan to the Court. We have much to think about. . . . https://t.co/VymOUUZWQaAmerica needs unions to combat an economy rigged against working ppl. #JANUS case was brought by a handful of right-wing billionaires to make it harder for working ppl to stick together. SCOTUS decision is a major step back in the pursuit of income equality. But we will fight on.Just met with @AmyMcGrathKY! We need to make sure she joins me in Congress.#BlueWave2018  https://t.co/rj5FkTUgUb https://t.co/v1Dv0cERXTWe need to pass the #EqualityAct NOW. Another reason why we need a better Congress! Members of the LGBTQ community deserve to live free of discrimination for being themselves. #UpChat #EqualityForward https://t.co/3mFlvOuHw4People like this are the future of American food &amp; agriculture. Congress must preserve and expand investment in these critical programs that support new energy in the industry. As we continue to deliberate the #FarmBill, it's not too late. #FixTheFarmBill
https://t.co/S6CPzHf57j#SCOTUS decision to uphold Trump's #MuslimBan is a historic &amp; shameful sanctioning of discrimination &amp; islamophobia. This is why we need a better Congress to hold this administration accountable for its discriminatory policies &amp; protect religious freedom. #NoMuslimBanEverLosing kids, dehumanizing people, entering people's houses without warrants, refusing to identify themselves…it’s time to #AbolishICE https://t.co/KlmjI2v0KwWhen will children be reunited with their families? How much longer will they be held in prison-like conditions? Demand answers. This fight is not over! #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepFamiliesTogetherVictory!

https://t.co/dWuBTkcxEaUPDATE: Another shameful day in the House. GOP turns its back on family farmers &amp; our most vulnerable &amp; passes #GOPFarmBill. This fight isn't over. Now we have to work even harder to make sure it doesn't become law. https://t.co/zgLl7dkVrkURGENT: House GOP trying to jam through #GOPFarmBill TODAY that would cut food stamps, give tax $$ to mega corporate farms, &amp; gut consumer, environmental, &amp; animal protections.Good call, Mayor @tedwheeler.
https://t.co/tbAJnZZrWQChildren are still being held hostage. Those fleeing persecution are still being treated like criminals. Victims of domestic violence are still being turned away. 

Trump needs to end his cruel &amp; inhumane “zero tolerance” policy. https://t.co/3RcW9DljlyThe groundswell of resistance is growing, but we must intensify our efforts. Now isn't the time for any American with a conscience to sit on the sidelines. We will cut them no slack until Trump reverses his cruel “zero tolerance” policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/VckZaMDoGq#Juneteenth marks the end of the darkest time in our history. Today, 153 years later, I fear we are facing a different shameful chapter as families are torn apart against their will. We must learn from the sins of our past &amp; commit to a more just future. #FamiliesBelongTogetherWe are introducing the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct TODAY. #FamiliesBelongTogether
https://t.co/5KUW0s6hen.@SecNielsen has repeatedly LIED to the American people about the administration's cruel actions at the border, denying ANY responsibility. Let's be clear: they are CHOOSING to take children away from their parents &amp; hold them hostage. Nielsen must RESIGN. #FamiliesBelongTogetherThey can lie all they want, but it doesn't change the fact that this administration is choosing to criminalize those fleeing violence. And enforcing it by yanking children from their parents. Sickening. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/14BjMNhfInThis is devastating. What kind of person thinks this should be a matter of routine? Truly evil. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/55kSXZ9B6oOn Father’s Day, I have one message: #FamiliesBelongTogether.
https://t.co/aOiV0o6DYXThis is a shameful moment. We're criminalizing people who've been persecuted &amp; we are enforcing it by yanking children from their families &amp; sending them God knows where. We came to Sheridan to get answers. We leave even more determined to end this evil. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/LfSP0IarjLExciting to witness the opening of Green Hop &amp; support for minority participation in our growing cannabis economy. More must be done to repair damage done by the failed prohibition of marijuana &amp; to ensure that the communities most impacted can benefit from this new industry. https://t.co/blez6kCyonThe level of corruption here is mind-boggling. Pruitt is absolutely failing in his job to protect human health and the environment, and his unethical (and illegal?) behavior only makes it worse. Despicable. #BootPruitt
https://t.co/xLDvGeGbwiWhat's the difference between Donald Trump and former Pennsylvania state senator Fumo, who spent four years in prison for similar violations? Trump and his foundation did worse and on a grander scale.
https://t.co/s4uls7hOktWe knew Trump used his foundation like a personal piggy bank. Nonetheless, it's shocking to see the evidence gathered in one place—thankfully by the NY Attorney General.
https://t.co/Fqtjnz6yPT$10k for Trump portrait. $264,631 to refurbish Plaza Hotel fountain. $100k to settle biz disputes. With Donald Trump, charity really does begin at home--except when it's a tool of his political campaign. How many people should be indicted??
https://t.co/R2KBZzgAD3@RepMcEachin @USRepKCastor @RepHuffman @SpeakerRyan Maybe @SpeakerRyan can't hear about Pruitt's scandals over the sound of Pruitt's motorcade. He's used them to take plenty of trips to restaurants around town (including chick-fil-a?) #BootPruittThis policy is so cruel that even Paul Ryan is starting to oppose Trump. I’m not holding my breath. No excuses for Trump or Ryan not to act NOW to end this evil. #FamiliesBelongTogether
https://t.co/IrCG0cb871What's happening because of Trump's immigration policies is horrific. Children separated from parents. Asylum-seekers held like criminals.

This is a matter of the health of our families &amp; planet. Now is the time for people across America to pay attention &amp; find their voice.
https://t.co/J5gfqxTFuiInstead of propping up for-profit colleges, we should be doing more to invest in public education, especially community colleges that help students get the credentials and training they need to succeed in the workforce, and at an affordable price.DeVos reinstates “watchdog” that failed to protect students from predatory for-profit colleges. She is now assuming the GOP role of doing the bidding for exploitative institutions that are leaving students w/ mountains of debt &amp; worthless degrees.
https://t.co/6UjFjx9uCdWhile Trump kisses the ring of an oppressive dictator and House Republicans cower, Russia is working to meddle in the midterms.

The @FCC's repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect TODAY. Senate voted to #SaveTheInternet. Since House GOP leadership refuses to act, my colleagues &amp; I are leading a discharge petition to force a vote!Non-stop obsessing over Trump's reckless antics will add no value to your life. My challenge to you: go on a “news diet” for 24 to 48 hours. Take a break. Let’s start the week w/ renewed energy &amp; commitment to stop Trump by organizing to help take back control of Congress.Minneapolis stops low-level marijuana stings when it’s revealed that 46 out of the 47 people arrested this year were black. Another powerful example of how racial injustice is baked into our failed system of marijuana prohibition.
https://t.co/Fjp8VTtzHXGOP sabotage of health care continues: After Trump &amp; GOP gave $1.5T tax break to big corporations &amp; richest, new report shows Medicare losing 3 yrs of funding. GOP is running Medicare into the ground so they can propose even deeper cuts in future. 
https://t.co/iFNN8Dlrt2Self-serving. Corrupt. Corporate crony. Scott Pruitt illustrates everything that is WRONG with this administration. 

It's past time for Pruitt to go . . . even Republicans are now feeling nervous. #BootPruitt
https://t.co/p6nRYp8FkaFor more than 100 years, the #AntiquitiesAct has protected public lands.

He blocked my amendment AGAIN that would ensure our veterans have safe &amp; equal access to medical marijuana.Farm subsidies were a safety net, but are now an entitlement for rich farmers. 32 yrs in a row?! The shameful House GOP #FarmBill makes it even easier for corporations to get subsidies, while making it harder for those really in need to get help w/ food.

What we know: states w/ OR's #VoteByMail are more secure &amp; have higher turnout. Congress must act on my legislation to expand OR's program nationwide to ensure election integrity.If you're looking for an amazing outdoor recreation experience, look no further than Oregon.

We must protect these treasured places &amp; #KeepItPublic. #OregonOutdoorsDay https://t.co/704zDn8vFyWith each shooting, nothing changes. It's outrageous. Any elected official or candidate that stays silent or refuses to enact commonsense reforms is not fit to serve. Today, we #WearOrange &amp; in November, let's elect a Congress that will act to #EndGunViolence.Trump &amp; his cronies have made clear: special interests are their priority, not the health of our communities &amp; planet. One year after leaving #ParisAgreement, Trump still can't repeal science. People understand the urgency to #ActOnClimate &amp; are fighting back. We are #StillIn.Horrifying. 

This administration’s cruel and inhumane policies shock the conscience. We are better than this.
https://t.co/mIFYXZSSA2Every day we must be clear: there's no place for hate in our America. We must reject white supremacy, bigotry &amp; racism. We need to make sure that through both our words &amp; actions that we are creating a welcoming and safe environment for everyone—&amp; stand w/ those who stand for us.One year ago our community was struck by an act of terror. Three brave Oregonians were stabbed for standing up to a white supremacist on a MAX train. Two of these heroes died. Sadly, this tragic attack was not an isolated incident. We've seen countless acts of hate.I agree with my friend @keithellison: the DNC chair should not be involved in primaries like this. We have a party to build and a congress to win.
https://t.co/lcp6XvfAVWAlso, thank you Cory for standing up to special interests &amp; working on our #FarmBill amendment that requires transparency &amp; accountability from Big Ag--especially as Dave Brat folded like a cheap suit facing a little bit of pressure before the House could consider it.Great meeting with @CoryBooker on some of our shared passions: agriculture reform, marijuana reform, and animal protection. He's the best! https://t.co/K75mzNUP2yI've never met a person who thinks it's a good idea for state-legal marijuana businesses to be forced to operate on a cash-only basis. These businesses just want to pay fair taxes w/ a check. Yet the federal govt remains in the way. We have the legislation. Now, Congress must act https://t.co/2UlGSmkNdZThis is disturbing.

This should be a question on every voter's mind.While the House was voting on the GOP #FarmBill, the GAO released a new report detailing farm subsidy abuse. Is this the reason GOP leadership didn't want to have a real debate on farm subsidy reform? #FixTheFarmBill https://t.co/T79wkjr4mlAnother Trump attack on women's health.

Dave Joyce for your efforts! https://t.co/CUZHVeMJ2THouse GOP is trying to ram through their #FarmBill that prioritizes wealthy corporate interests, cuts critical SNAP benefits &amp; leaves family farmers behind. It’s not too late. It remains unclear whether GOP has the votes. Keep the pressure up. Make your voice heard.YES!! Now, House Republican leadership must take action &amp; give us a vote to protect internet freedom. #SaveNetNeutrality https://t.co/4LeouZ0QekGood news, but way past due.

https://t.co/jZe5a5jUojTrump continues to reject fundamental facts about the Iran nuclear agreement. We did not ​"​withdraw.​"​ Instead ​Trump broke the agreement, putting everyone at risk &amp; further isolating the US. ​Even when officials in his own administration admit Iran​ had​ honored it.More evidence of the cruel racial injustice of the failed prohibition of marijuana. Congress can &amp; should act by passing the Marijuana Justice Act.
https://t.co/z6B6q5h10rTrump's FCC is threatening a free &amp; open internet. We are fighting back with legislation that would #SaveNetNeutrality. In the Senate, they are working to force a vote to bring us one step closer. Now it's time for action in the House.
https://t.co/UImID1RY41#twinning https://t.co/mgBWLwdHGgTrump is putting Iran back on the path toward a nuclear bomb. U.S. leadership will be diminished &amp; our ability to negotiate w/ North Korea undercut. He is manufacturing an international crisis. #IranDeal

An amazing display of veterans joined us today to demand that lawmakers meet our obligations to the brave Iraqi &amp; Afghan men &amp; women who risked their lives to help us. #SaveOurAllies https://t.co/gYKUG1iNIONow is the time to stop the King Amendment. Everyone who cares about health, the environment, &amp; the treatment of animals, must be heard NOW—loud &amp; clear.Cleverly named, but insidiously drafted, the so-called "Right to Farm" state ballot initiative in Oklahoma was similar. It failed by a 60-40 margin (in a Trump state!) b/c farmers, ranchers, consumers &amp; ppl who care about the environment &amp; animal welfare spoke out..@Harvard_Law explains just how bad the King Amendment is:
https://t.co/AfONyj1QU1The King Amendment would have devastating consequences. Examples: Overturn state bans on baby food containing BPA. Weaken state laws that prevent animal abusers from running pet businesses.EVERYONE should be paying attention: the GOP #FarmBill approved by House Ag Committee includes the King Amendment, which made a bad Farm Bill much WORSE. It would overturn state &amp; local protections for consumers, environment, food safety, animal welfare.
https://t.co/PLk2QRMwi2Scott Pruitt is unfit to lead the EPA. It's time to #BootPruitt.Scott Pruitt has failed to protect the environment, gutting standards for carbon pollution, pesticides, and toxic chemicals—&amp; even attacking scientific research. #BootPruittScott Pruitt has failed to protect your health, undermining protections for clean drinking water. #BootPruittScott Pruitt has abused taxpayer $$ and given us new definitions for the words crony &amp; corruption. #BootPruittScott Pruitt has to go. #BootPruitt$100 a month may not seem like much to somebody who spent $30,000 on a new table for his office, but for those struggling to make ends meet, it can mean the difference between having a roof over your head or being homeless.

Now is the time to redouble our efforts.In the year since Sen. Wyden &amp; I introduced comprehensive marijuana reform legislation, it’s exciting to see momentum build. Sen. Schumer’s announcement, as Democratic leader in the Senate, is immensely significant. https://t.co/mi0yq65DceWe need to #FixTheFarmBill. More on my #FoodAndFarmAct here:
https://t.co/cjQEBg25GLPeople want good food that is healthy, local, and sustainable. Congress has an opportunity to catch up and help those who need it most. House GOP #FarmBill misses the mark by far, giving more to those who need it the least and making it harder for those in need to get help.My #FoodAndFarmAct: expands access to healthy food and brings rural and urban communities together. #FixTheFarmBillGOP #FarmBill: slashes nutrition assistance for those who need it most.My #FoodAndFarmAct: invests in farmers markets and other local food programs, and helps beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers get priority. #FixTheFarmBillFarmers markets are a great way to meet local farmers, learn more about where your food is coming from &amp; of course, get healthy foods. 

GOP #FarmBill: cuts programs that help promote farmers markets and local food.My #FoodAndFarmAct: expands permanent funding for programs that help beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers get their feet off the ground and connects retiring farmers with the next generation. #FixTheFarmBillGOP #FarmBill: does little to invest in beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers.My #FoodAndFarmAct: doubles investments in conservation and reforms these programs to actually focus on the best practices that improve the environment, while ensuring that smaller farmers, NOT industrial Ag, get funding. #FixTheFarmBillGOP #FarmBill: cuts conservation funding by $1 billion and gets rid of the Conservation Stewardship Program–one of the largest programs we use to help farmers become more sustainable.My #FoodAndFarmAct: gets rid of excessive commodity programs, limits payments to rich farmers, &amp; makes crop insurance more accessible to farmers that grow REAL food. #FixTheFarmBillGOP #FarmBill: doubles down on paying too much to the wrong people to grow the wrong food in the wrong places. It’s filled with loopholes that are designed to make it easier for big corporations to get subsidies. 94% of these subsidies go to only six “commodity” crops.Flying under the radar on Capitol Hill: the House Ag Committee is considering the #FarmBill – a massive piece of legislation that dictates everything from the price of a gallon of milk to the availability of healthy food for those in need. 

The House GOP #FarmBill is a disgrace:#TaxDay is an unfortunate reminder of GOP's misplaced priorities: special interests &amp; big corporations over hardworking American families. And after they’ve made a hash out of the tax code, we will have trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. YOU deserve better.Who is paying the price for #GOPTaxScam? YOU. Medicare, Social Security &amp; Medicaid are now on Paul Ryan's chopping block. #TaxDayTo no one's surprise: massive tax cuts DO NOT pay for themselves. GOP is putting more $$ in the pockets of those who need it least, while the deficit is exploding (the last 2 months have each set record deficit highs). The #GOPTaxScam adds $1.9 trillion &amp; counting. #TaxDayIn the aftermath of #GOPTaxScam, we're witnessing how bad it really is: massive tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans &amp; biggest companies at the expense of American families. #TaxDayPre-match meeting with Timber Joey and my grandsons. #RCTID https://t.co/B16HK8ZV6pWe need a long term strategy in Syria, not just military strikes. Congress should have been consulted. It’s the next steps that matter most or the situation could spiral out of control.We can’t take anything for granted. Trump changes with the wind &amp; GOP leadership is still in our way. We need to protect the integrity of state-legal marijuana programs by acting NOW.Trump's announcement . . . Boehner, our longtime opponent, joining a cannabis company . . . movement on the ground—MI, IL, MO . . . can you feel the earth shifting for lasting marijuana reform?? https://t.co/cFz4jwAng8I have a better idea that would #FixTheFarmBill:
https://t.co/cjQEBg25GLHouse GOP released their version of #FarmBill today. To no one's surprise, their plan is MORE subsidies for industrial ag, w/ little support for family farms, environment &amp; people who eat, &amp; assistance slashed for those who need it most.Given the daily allegations of wrongdoing about the White House and Trump campaign, Congress must act to #ProtectMueller and NOW.
https://t.co/FeSgWNW5OyNow that Republicans are in charge, they've produced trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. They can't be serious about a balanced budget amendment without a plan to balance the budget. They don't have one. This is just a cynical political ploy.House GOP's "balanced budget amendment" would mean slashing Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid &amp; other programs WE care about deeply to pay for THEIR massive tax breaks for the richest Americans &amp; largest companies.
https://t.co/sZmQL6lbVZCorruption and cronyism at its worst. Pruitt has to go. #BootPruitt
https://t.co/cJcFdLNEkMRemember when GOP promised that giving massive tax cuts to the richest Americans &amp; corporations would pay for itself? Surprise, it won’t. New report: #GOPTaxScam will add $1.9 trillion to debt.
https://t.co/rpO18mjvceWe can and should do better. It's on all of us to close the gender pay gap: lawmakers, employers, &amp; workers alike. #EqualPayDayWhat Trump fails to understand is that this devastating situation has no simple, military solution. It requires a thoughtful, long-term strategy. There's absolutely no evidence that he can do it.Obama drew criticism on Syria by declaring a redline, then being unable to enforce it, having no consensus from Congress or support from US allies. While the conflict is complex, we can't allow these atrocities to persist &amp; we must work w/ our allies to end this war.Trump is completely incoherent on Syria. He's signaled his intention to withdraw troops, which may well have emboldened Assad &amp; now he's threatening military strikes. Meanwhile, he continues to alienate our allies &amp; all of this is clouded by his love/hate relationship w/ Putin.Trump’s attacks on our democracy are disgraceful. 

If there was ever a time to put country over party, it’s now. Congress must act to #ProtectMueller. https://t.co/PRFybVrWQXAmazing gun violence forum organized by our young people.

He has failed to protect your health, failed to safeguard the environment, and failed to follow the law. He is unfit to lead the EPA. #BootPruittAn insidious attempt to undermine public trust, incite fear, and rig the 2020 Census with alternative facts. Trump continues to pander to his political base while ignoring his constitutional duty to ensure an accurate Census.

It's critical in our fight against climate change &amp; must do more to help sustainable farming practices, improve conservation &amp; reduce carbon pollution. #AgDayEvery American deserves access to healthy &amp; affordable food. We need a FOOD and Farm Bill that dedicates more resources to connecting communities &amp; farmers and protects &amp; expands food access. #AgDayWe need to do more to support local food systems &amp; help the next generation of farmers. #AgDayIt's time to prioritize small, underserved &amp; family farmers over Big Ag. For too long our food &amp; farm policies have given too much $$ to the wrong people to grow the wrong foods in the wrong places. #AgDayIf you care about what you eat, how your food is grown &amp; how it impacts the environment, this #AgDay join me in the fight for a FOOD and Farm Bill that's more visionary, equitable &amp; cost-effective.

Conservation is a serious matter &amp; should be guided by science &amp; field experts, not the trophy hunting industry.When you think it couldn’t get worse, just wait for Trump’s next tweet or press release.

https://t.co/4zYIqWSMjUThe infrastructure crisis in America demands real solutions, but Trump's 'plan' doesn't cut it. Rather than adding to the burden on already cash-strapped cities &amp; states, the federal government must step up. 
https://t.co/jvrueYfgc7Trump refused to release the Democratic memo because of “sensitive“ information. Any guesses? I suspect sensitive shows the Republicans misleading or Trump being further implicated.While it’s encouraging that there is a little more stability for the fiscal situation, and there is some needed investment for neglected priorities. Overall, the budget proposal falls far short of the mark, and was not worthy of my support.One can only hope that the intense attention will finally convince GOP leadership to allow the House to fully &amp; fairly consider &amp; vote on legislation to #ProtectDREAMers.Congress failed again to protect hundreds of thousands of young Americans facing immediate deportation to countries they don’t know. The #DREAMers, &amp; the vast majority of Americans who support them, deserve immediate resolution.It sentences us and our children to trillion dollar deficits for years to come. It is a missed opportunity to show some fiscal restraint and repair a broken process.The budget proposal was not worthy of support. Apart from troubling special interest provisions—from unnecessary and unwise spending on nuclear weapons to enhancing agricultural subsidies for cotton—it continues the explosion of our national debt.The farce continues. Senate Republicans forcing a shutdown.A #militaryparade wastes badly needed money and sends all the wrong signals. Joining @RepVeasey to put a stop to Trump's authoritarian demands. https://t.co/uLjmGWafPdFrom our crumbling roads and bridges to lead-contaminated water, America is falling apart and behind.

That’s his #NuclearPostureReview. https://t.co/RkzDQDv2RRFor GOP to claim #NunesMemo has nothing to do w/ undermining the Russia investigation is an appalling lie. Look at Trump’s tweets.

They deserve certainty and protection.GOP may think it's satisfying its base by blaming Dems for #TrumpShutdown, but they are losing the battle w/ the public who knows better. Even their former RNC Chair agrees this is the result of GOP incompetence. We Democrats must stand firm &amp; make clear what’s at stake.Exciting to listen to Nancy Pelosi and my House colleagues address tens of thousands energized women marchers (and lots of men as well) on the Capitol Mall. https://t.co/V15wxdjxblRyan refuses to play fair, rewriting history from the House floor &amp; not giving Democrats equal time to speak. When they control everything and can't deliver, the fault lies with Trump and the GOP. #TrumpShutdownRepublicans should use their complete control of power and govern. If they want our help, they have to work with us—and not hold the American people hostage.Republicans knew for months that the critical &amp; popular Children’s Health Insurance Program was going to expire last fall. If they would allow a vote on its reauthorization, it would pass and save the government $6 billion over the next 10 years.Dreamers are in limbo because Donald Trump unilaterally decided to end the DACA program. If Republicans had the courage to allow a vote on our bipartisan legislation to fix the issue, it would pass overwhelmingly.Today is the first anniversary of complete Republican control of our government. The #TrumpShutdown is theirs.This #TrumpShutdown is insanity. Republicans have no excuses. Democrats are eager &amp; ready to work w/ Republicans—but they have to work with us. The priorities Dems are fighting for are bipartisan. The American public deserves better. I hope we can give them what they deserve.The sad drama continues. Awaiting Senate reaction on funding government one week at a time.

It’s time for ANYONE who cares about this issue to mobilize and push back strongly against this decision. https://t.co/S0neITlP5qThis is outrageous. Going against the majority of Americans—including a majority of Republican voters—who want the federal government to stay out of the way is perhaps one of the stupidest decisions the Attorney General has made. 
https://t.co/favJUDVBiAThere is broad recognition that the War on Drugs is an abject failure. After over $1T spent, the problem is worse than when we started. Its tragic effects felt in every US community &amp; in countries around the globe. It’s past time we change our approach.

Our mission in 2018: #ReplaceAndRepeal.#GOPTaxBill fails the American people, fails to invest in our communities, fails to deal w/ the challenges we face.#GOPTaxBill is NOT about helping the middle class. It provides permanent &amp; massive tax breaks for wealthy, w/ top 1% getting 83% of the benefits! The rest of America pays the price. 86 million Americans face a tax INCREASE!I voted NO on #GOPTaxBill—the largest transfer of wealth in our nation's history, paid for by mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's future.Expect the #CorkerKickback to be just one of a series of embarrassing revelations about the egregious provisions snuck into the GOP tax bill to buy Senate votes and please major campaign donors.

Rather than cooperate with investigators &amp; take a step back, Pai forged ahead.My constituents are not alone. Americans overwhelmingly want #NetNeutrality protections to continue.

https://t.co/3VsZ3daGsZBackwards priorities: The #GOPTaxPlan gives PERMANENT benefits to those who need it the least—the top 1% and massive corporations. The middle class will see TEMPORARY benefits &amp; many will end up paying MORE in taxes.Why is the #GOPTaxPlan overwhelmingly unpopular? It's a massive giveaway to the richest corporations &amp; Americans &amp; leaves working and middle-income families behind.Republicans have done the impossible. The GOP tax CUTS are less popular than past tax INCREASES! #GOPTaxPlan
https://t.co/oQAkAXlgzSStood in the Senate chamber, watching the last shred of fiscal discipline melt away as corker throws in the towelProud of Portland's own Professor @KClausing -- telling it like it is on GOP tax plan: https://t.co/CHayIhmnZjCEOs are clear: the $$ corporations will get from massive tax cuts will reward their shareholders. For Trump &amp; Republicans to claim otherwise is just false. Continue to speak out!
https://t.co/3VsZ3daGsZAs GOP in Congress works to cut taxes for the wealthiest, it's also jeopardizing the health of 80k kids in Oregon. Joined @KateBrownForOR today to demand my GOP colleagues do their jobs &amp; #ExtendCHIP to help make sure all kids have access to health care. https://t.co/BoJ6kqaFCRThis is exactly why we introduced the #FoodAndFarmAct &amp; why we need to reform the #FarmBill—a critical trend for the future of agriculture &amp; a healthy industry:

Making education unaffordable is bad for America &amp; terrible for grad students.I’m thankful the cruel GOP tax plan to deny families $21 billion student loan interest tax deductions can still be stoppedI am thankful that the Republican tax scheme has not yet passed, with an Alzheimer’s tax denying over 9 million middle income Americans almost $90 billion in tax relief.Kicking off the holiday season w/ @PinkMartiniBand &amp; fruitcake, of course. Tune in to @AMNW on Thanksgiving morning at 9AM for their holiday special (You might even see me sing a duet...) https://t.co/HVynFKitOMOutrageous. The American people will lose out.

https://t.co/ufLR1sBrU5An honor to welcome @GabbyGiffords back to Capitol Hill &amp; to dedicate the Democratic cloakroom to her &amp; Leo Ryan. They are true public servants. https://t.co/VV3mnJQB7vAs if GOP plan to increase the national debt by $1.5T to cut taxes for the ultra rich and big corporations wasn't bad enough, Senate GOP now wants to take health care away from 13 million Americans. https://t.co/bLiZvrQUzyWinemakers Lynn and Ron Penner Ash honored at Salud!

We’re not going to stop fighting until our veterans get equal access to mmj!I’ve heard from countless vets that medical marijuana is critical to giving them relief they need. In states like OR where mmj is legal, it’s outrageous that Congress prevents VA from working w/ vets who could benefit.We all have a part to play to prevent veteran suicide. Whether it’s volunteering for the prevention hotline or Congress prioritizing the needs of our veterans, rather than cutting critical programs to reduce taxes for people like Donald Trump.There is an epidemic of veteran suicide in America. It's a tragedy that we lose one veteran almost every hour of the day. The numbers are even worse here in in West.What better way to honor #VeteransDay than at #PortlandVA speaking w/ veterans &amp; the men and women who care for them. https://t.co/9pgN8SemeyThank you, Suzanne! The treats helped my staff and the wine helped fortify the Committee. https://t.co/mqSuDEfWS5We shouldn't let GOP off the hook just b/c they are desperate to pass ANY tax cut &amp; forgot their concerns about debt https://t.co/m58DybTxyYGOP showed no confidence in their absurd claims, voting down my circuit breaker amdt that would reverse tax cuts if the deficit increasesTax breaks don't pay for themselves. Independent economists agree. GOP must be held accountable when their rosy assumptions dont materializeGOP raises alarm re: rising natl debt but tax plan would add $1.5T to deficit while giving huge tax breaks to largest corporations &amp; richestPDX artist Joe Mueller of @WildwoodBespoke transformed my Ways &amp; Means Cmte necktie (gift from @repkevinbrady) into my look for tax debate: https://t.co/TOR0aVIZjjA month after Vegas, another shooting.
