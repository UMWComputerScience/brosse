President Trump's reckless trade war is costing hardworking Americans good-paying jobs. This madness must stop. https://t.co/dBnIOWk3MkMake no mistake, yesterday's attack on public unions will inevitably lead to attacks on private unions, and an attack on any union is an attack on American workers. I will continue to stand for unions and the rights of workers. #Janus #UnionStrongDo you have one of these conditions?

If you do, @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP are trying to take your health care coverage away. It's time to fight back. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/MNSyRkltVePresident Trump's cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reuniting them.

The American people deserve nothing less. #KennedyThat being said, the stakes over his replacement could not be higher. As we've seen over the past 2 weeks, SCOTUS' ability to make sweeping changes to our legal system cannot be overlooked. #KennedyI want to thank Justice Kennedy for dedicating over 30 years of his life in service of our nation as a Supreme Court Justice. While i may not have agreed with all of his decisions, I have no doubt they were all based on his sincerest interpretation of the law. #KennedyThe public has a right to know how much money is being spent on @realDonaldTrump's family separation policy. That's why I, along with 107 of my colleagues, sent a letter to @SecNielsen and @SecAzar demanding answers. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/eehmZ69J9mWill @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP keep telling Democrats what to do on immigration when THEY CAN’T EVEN PASS AN IMMIGRATION BILL in a Congress they completely control? #tiredofwinning? #manypeoplearesaying
https://t.co/H4dfYP8yF5Another win for corporate America at the expense of workers. But the fight isn't over. As seen with teachers across the country, when workers stand together to demand their worth, they get what they've earned. We must keep up the fight.#Janus #UnionStrong

Not for our farmers, not for our consumers, and not for our communities. It's time for both parties to come together to work on a real, bipartisan #FarmBill.Rural communities struggle to access capital for infrastructure and economic development. Yet, the #GOPFarmBill still increases costs to financing by adding fees to Rural Development loans.The hyper partisan #GOPFarmBill would cut $14 billion in #SNAP, take school meals from 265,000 kids, and cause 400,000 households to lose SNAP benefits. As a nation, we shouldn't be taking food from Americans who need it the most. #ProtectSNAPThe last major US nail manufacturer--and their 500 workers--could be out of business by Labor Day thanks to the Trump tariffs.

To all those celebrating around the world, I wish you a blessed #Ramadan https://t.co/ji2ttuz8dkEnjoyed speaking to @nardotrealtor to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act and to share the importance of providing fair and equitable housing opportunities for all. https://t.co/dM5Ntr6BmHVery pleased to see @Ford's quick response to my letter and that the Claycomo plant will be reopened at fully capacity!
https://t.co/U0wVqN5xLvGood to see @amazon respond to our calls for more diversity by implementing the “Rooney Rule”. But this is only a single step. I look forward to seeing what other actions Amazon will take to showcase a commitment to diversity in leadership. #CBCTech2020

https://t.co/oxhsu3lE9SThe Trump administration has implemented a lot of immoral and un-American policies since they came to office. But the decision to separate families fleeing violence or simply seeking a better life is downright unconscionable.
https://t.co/1wziY9PRydThe only thing more frustrating than seeing Republicans mislead Americans about their #GOPTaxScam is seeing the people who are being hurt by it. Thank you to Rick Pence for sharing his story with us yesterday. @MachinistsUnion 
https://t.co/Et8SDzYBYZDelighted to see that Kansas City's Full Employment Council Inc. was selected for a $200,000 @EPA grant. The money will go towards recruiting, training, and placing workers in sustainable green jobs. Congratulations!.@amazon is ahead of the curve in so many ways, but their resistance to senior level #diversity is something that needs to be addressed ASAP. I urge them to seriously reconsider the proposal to implement a Rooney Rule. #CBCTECH2020.@amazon's employees asked the Board of Directors to implement a Rooney Rule to help diversify their board, which has ZERO minorities. 

The Board said no. #CBCTECH2020

Coming from a family of teachers, I know firsthand the hard work they put in. So, to all the teachers in MO's 5th district &amp; across the country: Thank you! #TeacherAppreciationDayThe Iran deal was by no means perfect, but by all accounts it was working. The decision to leave the deal and our allies holding the bag is yet another shortsighted decision by this president..@realDonaldTrump's decision to pull out of the Iran deal not only makes America less safe by allowing the Iranians to restart their nuclear proliferation, but also undermines American credibility in future negotiations, including North Korean denuclearization talks.Having to decide between paying rent &amp; buying food is unacceptable. That's why I oppose President Trump's requested budget cuts to affordable housing programs throughout the US. https://t.co/tylsSZuBqNAfter spending $2 trillion on tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, it seems especially cruel the @realDonaldTrump administration wants to cut $7 billion from the Children's Health Insurance Program. #CHIP

On #WorldPressFreedomDay we celebrate the important work journalists do to strengthen our democracy and hold our leaders accountable. Today, let us reaffirm our commitment to protect a strong and able free press throughout the world.One of the biggest concerns I hear from rural areas is lack of access to broadband. Congress must fund infrastructure that will get them connected. Happy to speak at the Rural Development and Utilities Service Broadband Workshop in Higginsville yesterday to discuss solutions. https://t.co/VvidzITLt1According to the Institute on Taxation &amp; Economic Policy, the top 1% of Americans will get $84 billion in 2019 thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. To put that in perspective, #SNAP, which helps feed 39 million Americans and 1 in 4 children, only costs $58 billion.

https://t.co/Zv1lHIMub3Roughly 4 million Americans have lost health insurance since 2016 with the uninsured rate jumping to 15.5%. Of those that lost coverage, most of them were lower-income families.
https://t.co/uKDhYAoT1USince @realDonaldTrump's tax cuts have been enacted, we haven't seen the promised explosion of investments in American workers. Instead, we've seen giant corporations invest in stock buybacks so the wealthy can further enrich themselves.

https://t.co/qiGhDJ4lwzThis is how democracies fail in today's world. Not by one single event, but by slowly eroding the institutions that are foundational. This administration's attacks on a free press and voting rights should have all Americans deeply troubled.

Only 22% have reported seeing a pay increase, while 55% have said they've seen no bump at all.

https://t.co/6FaArMrM2IThis morning, I spoke on the House floor about my concerns with the 2018 #FarmBill and the importance of Democrats and Republicans working together to craft a bipartisan bill.
https://t.co/hJtjLZVlpUThank you to @WHF_DC for inviting me to talk at the Women in Housing and Finance Symposium this afternoon! Happy to discuss the great potential of #fintech for women-owned small businesses.

We discussed the importance of confronting algorithmic bias and promoting diversity in #fintech. Glad Elevate and Dion are stepping up to the challenge. https://t.co/Btt64AeRUyJust like the #GOPTaxScam and #FarmBill, Republicans chose not to work with Democrats to reauthorize #HEA in a bipartisan way. Now the American people are going to pay for it. #StandwithStudents https://t.co/4G271YP2TkThe House GOP #FarmBill proposal creates massive state bureaucracy and burden on state budgets. Putting all the costs on states is not the way to get more efficiency out of the #SNAP program.
https://t.co/VOzpUfplexAnother study shows the #GOPTaxScam overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans, giving a $17 billion break to millionaires.
https://t.co/bubjGCzoGjThe U.S. Department of Education was investigating why black students in Bryan, Texas are almost four times as likely as white students to be suspended. Then @BetsyDeVosED took over.

https://t.co/GnHIplBz2xThe #GOPTaxScam, #TrumpBudget, and the so-called #PROSPERAct all have one thing in common: putting corporate profits over students and working families. #StandWithStudents https://t.co/VDy7XRBYpRThe Majority insists they want to help low-income Americans by implementing work requirements for food stamps and other social safety net programs. In reality, work requirements only make it harder for struggling families to survive.

https://t.co/x3D6MPCj7tThe @InternetAssn should be commended for taking proactive steps to improve diversity in its own workforce and in its industry. This should be the commencement and not the culmination of a larger effort to address issues of inclusion in the tech industry, including #fintech &amp; #AI https://t.co/0FuvQkegA7The Senate just voted to make it easier for auto lenders to discriminate. The Majority's attack on the @CFPB--an agency dedicated to protecting American consumers from predatory lenders--continues at the expense of everyday Americans.
https://t.co/FeXmUUNZP1For the entirety of @EPAScottPruitt's tenure, he has proven time and again that he is more interested in self-service than public service. From the lavish spending to the ethical bankruptcy, he's demonstrated an inability to lead. That's why I've called for his resignation. https://t.co/7aSj6QTKr9I want to send my sincerest condolences to the Bush family for their loss. Barbara Bush was a remarkable woman and a dedicated servant to our nation. May she forever rest in peace.In Missouri, the top 5% of earners will receive 63% of the state's tax breaks from the #GOPTaxScam. How's that for helping middle class families? https://t.co/CpJZiw5Am4The filing period has been extended for a day. If you didn't get to file your taxes yesterday, make sure you get them in today! https://t.co/GAgSjGvDmrIn Missouri, #SNAP reached 759,000 residents--more than 10% of the population--and kept 221,000 people out of poverty, including 109,000 children. We should be doing more to help these families, not throwing them to the wind.For 50 years Dems and Repubs have worked together to combine food and farm programs in a bipartisan #FarmBill. Unfortunately, as has become too customary, partisanship is triumphing to the detriment of the American people. We must get back to compromise and bipartisanship!The GOP House #FarmBill guts nearly $20 billion from #SNAP--our nation's most important and effective anti-hunger program. This could ultimately result in higher levels of hunger &amp; poverty, worse health, and other negative outcomes. We must #ProtectSNAP
https://t.co/bHOtMpoWbfAnd don't forget, tax cuts don't pay for themselves, regardless of what the Majority wants to say. So how do they pay for the #GOPTaxScam? By cutting critical benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. https://t.co/TgsuHZVUq1About to go live with @TeamCavuto. Make sure to tune in!It's #TaxDay! A day to remember that the Majority spent more than $2 trillion on the #GOPTaxScam, a bill that will give 83%  of its benefits to the wealthiest 1%, raise taxes on 86 million middle class families, &amp; where more than half of Americans have seen no relief at all.Dr. Martin Luther King left a mission for true justice unfinished.

I hear @MCPLMO is even having a scavenger hunt... https://t.co/G7JTuGM30eRepublicans are pushing a "balanced budget amendment" that would force massive cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, &amp; SS. This comes after they added nearly $2 TRILLION to the debt through the #GOPTaxScam to support their corporate donors. Even from the GOP, the hypocrisy is remarkable. https://t.co/NI8CMTKckrAn accurate #2020Census is critical to our nation. And the political decision by the Trump administration to add an untested &amp; damaging question about citizenship to the census at the 11th hour will suppress participation.

Thank you for your dedicated service to the nation. #NotoriousRBG https://t.co/xQlVmcjckM.@KUHoops loses in the first round and @Mizzou @MizzouHoops goes all the way...Let the Madness begin! #MIZ https://t.co/wboHmul2t2Happy 150th Anniversary to the @KCMOFireDept! @KCMOManager Troy Schulte announced new Director and Fire Chief today. Congratulations to @KCMOFireChief Gary Reese! I look forward to working with you. @KCMO @IAFFLocal42 @IAFFLocal3808 https://t.co/0YfCHtwvXlSo proud of the students participating in #NationalWalkoutDay. These kids are the future of our country and they are fed up with politicians putting campaign donations over their lives.  #Enough #NeverAgain https://t.co/2kmnRjaAfsGlad to see someone is holding Russia accountable. https://t.co/NQnlqEiUK1Congratulations to @ConorLambPA on the hard-fought and well-deserved victory last night. Another race that proves every vote counts! I look forward to working with Representative-elect Lamb as we move forward.My condolences to the family and friends of #StephenHawking. A once-in-a-generation mind that inspired millions to follow their passion for discovery. At a moment when we need scientists more than ever, his brilliance will be sorely missed.Most small-business owners say they will not hire, give raises because of the #GOPTaxScam.

https://t.co/6ItQ5YSy1uStock buybacks have doubled this year thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. Wages? Not so much....
https://t.co/xdu5LsTMs7The tendency of the Trump administration to mislead or flat-out lie when the facts don't fit their narrative is beyond concerning--it's dangerous.
https://t.co/VFp5o8UoXGThe constant reshuffling of White House staff is not health for the country. The inability to maintain a cohesive course cannot bring confidence to our allies across the world. 
https://t.co/mQkSx54UQ6Our students deserve someone who is willing to fight for them. Time and time again, Secretary DeVos has proven this is not her intention.
https://t.co/ExNEsymXPNLack of adequate funding is BY FAR the biggest barrier to rebuilding our Nation's crumbling infrastructure and the Trump #InfrastructureScam completely fails to address this reality. https://t.co/WIczEDVFjJIf you are not willing to visit schools that are struggling, how can you understand the challenges they are facing? I encourage @BetsyDeVosED to actually visit some of these schools. Might make for an easier interview next time... https://t.co/8WGQYTRlpyThe @EPA scientific advisory board hasn’t met in 6 months. The fact that Adm. Pruitt refuses to listen to scientists at the top of their fields should concern all Americans. The protection of our environment is too important to refuse their expertise.
https://t.co/QHgI6Jq8J6Report after report reveals the #GOPTaxScam is overwhelmingly benefitting corporations and shareholders instead of American workers. RT if you are paying attention!
https://t.co/StwsqeisZZAnother decision that puts corporate profits over American students. @BetsyDeVosED continues to use the Department of Education as a shield for student loan collectors while collectively throwing 40 million Americans under the bus.
https://t.co/xfKLiS50MqThanks to intervention from the courts, #DACA recipients can continue to renew their status. More information here:

https://t.co/fhh5xMJamTStacking federal agencies with ex-lobbyists and allowing them to regulate the industries they made a living off of is an interesting way to drain the swamp.
https://t.co/Xji7L5vNwhNew evidence of the minimum wage doing what it's supposed to do: Help low-wage workers. We have to do more to help hardworking Americans. That is why I proudly #FightFor15 
https://t.co/OLSb7ix4yjToday, we remember the women who fought so hard to get us where we are, honor their sacrifices, and celebrate the progress we've made. To all the women in the world fighting for equality and against injustice: Thank you! #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/tRA6pad8bfEnjoyed meeting with these wonderful students. If these are the future leaders of America, I'm excited to see what the future holds! https://t.co/2tNgT1Z6PUFor being the greatest negotiator that ever negotiated a negotiation, it seems like @realDonaldTrump should be able to do better than this.
https://t.co/E1eZKF05s0I agree with @realDonaldTrump--elephant hunting is definitely a "horror show". So why is President Trump making it legal to bring elephant trophies back to the US, which will undoubtedly lead to more horror shows?
https://t.co/dTgQ7huqG6Roughly 120 American #DREAMers lose their #DACA protections every day. They deserve to be protected &amp; to live without fear. #ProtectDreamers #DreamActNow70% of the tax windfall is going to shareholders, with only 13% going to wage increases. It's because of policies like the #GOPTaxScam that the rich get richer, while American workers are left struggling to maintain. This is how income inequality works.
https://t.co/QN9i3tDCFTAmazing how communities come together following a disaster. 1 year ago, a tornado devastated the Oak Grove &amp; Odessa communities. Through hard work, willpower, &amp; cooperation they’ve been able to rebuild.  I’d love to see some before &amp; after pictures if any followers can share! https://t.co/ZHmOxX4nBnNow that's what I'm talking about! https://t.co/bAcxaiCwNYDon't forget to apply for a @CBCFInc scholarship! There are several different scholarships people can apply for, each one a fantastic opportunity with great benefits. More information can be found here:
https://t.co/CfN3hc2fBU https://t.co/D6QDPfFII8With storms becoming progressively more severe, it makes no logical sense to cut funding from the National Flood Insurance Program. We need to reauthorize the NFIP and fully fund it. https://t.co/tHKkFa5O7oThe reality of the #GOPTaxScam? Kill jobs &amp; keep it quiet.
https://t.co/WcCC3OtHgmFollowing 6 months of inaction by President Trump &amp; the Majority, today marks the arbitrary deadline to discontinue #DACA. Fortunately, courts have issued a temporary stay, but Congress needs to end this madness for good by passing the #DreamActNow
