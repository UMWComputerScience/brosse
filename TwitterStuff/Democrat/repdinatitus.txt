This bill actually protects legal marijuana businesses and users by removing MJ from the CSA.The Trump Admin. is refusing to stand up for Nevadans with pre-existing conditions. Remember the days before the #AffordableCareAct when people were denied coverage or simply could not afford it? I will continue to combat GOP efforts to sabotage the ACA. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/KDfiZiX0y4On this Father’s Day let us remember the children being torn from their parents’ arms. The Trump policy of family separation goes against basic human values. #KeepFamiliesTogetherThanks to @LVCCLD for hosting the 8th Annual #Juneteenth Celebration. https://t.co/0dGQlhuH80Republican leaders say they don’t want children torn from their parents. So I call on them to join me in passing the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to end the nightmare for immigrant families. (4/4)The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct prohibits family separation, requires our government to reunify parents and children, and makes clear that family unity is paramount in our nation’s immigration policy. (3/4)In addition to the resolution I cosponsored last week, I’m cosponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to push back against the Trump Admin’s cruel policy of separating families. (2/4)The Trump/Sessions policy to separate families at the border is inhumane and must be met with words and actions. #KeepFamiliesTogether (1/4) https://t.co/hgmNIKV2CP.@ACLUNV honors Senator Richard Bryan with the Liberty in Government Award. https://t.co/zfIhZ8KWyGI want to wish those celebrating Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, an #EidMubarak. https://t.co/z1TawGVltkLast night the Democrats routed the Republicans 21-5 at the #CongressionalBaseballGame for charity. #TeamTitus was there to support our team.

Very appreciative of their strong voices on important issues. https://t.co/meMePBhXIbThanks to @VetsVillageLV for hosting today’s mobile office hours. We’ll be back the second Tuesday of each month. https://t.co/z2MshIsiJ4Today I joined a resolution led by @RepLoisFrankel &amp; @RosaDeLauro to recognize the significance of #EqualPayDay. All workers should receive equal pay for equal work. It's time for #EqualPay.It's #EqualPayDay on April 10! In Nevada, women make 81 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. For women of color, the #wagegap is much larger. Congress should pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct now! https://t.co/QIiBAsph55Proud to be an original cosponsor of the #PinkTax Repeal Act here in Congress w/ @RepSpeier, and to work with @YvannaCancela, @NVJauregui, @Nicole4Nevada,
&amp; @JoyceWoodhouse to get #PinkTax repeal on the ballot in Nevada.Despite intense opposition, the Trump administration continues to explore ways to cut access to #SNAP. Today, I told @SecretarySonny that changes to #ABAWD  waivers will only serve to drive up hunger in Nevada. https://t.co/l5z2Z35iS3Happy Orthodox #Easter to all those celebrating. To my fellow Greeks, kaló Páscha! https://t.co/ijGOICpDS0
