Thankful for the @conexion_tn team. https://t.co/UlyFS6M0BMNewsrooms are places where knowledge, speech and debate flow freely.

I‚Äôm disappointed that the Supreme Court upheld the ban today. Congress must find some courage and pass legislation to reverse the ruling. https://t.co/AKfrkINdPYProud to join all House Democrats &amp; 41 Republicans in defeating an anti-family immigration bill: https://t.co/b10dvbuVxRThe bill I opposed:
 
‚Ä¢ Did nothing to stop family separations.
‚Ä¢ Did nothing to reunify families recently separated at the border.
‚Ä¢ Included no permanent solution for Dreamers.
‚Ä¢ Eliminated the ability of U.S. citizens to sponsor their parents, adult children &amp; siblings.This bill is too cruel to support and it doesn‚Äôt do anything to reunite families already separated at the border. We could be voting on bipartisan bills that would begin to solve some of our nation‚Äôs immigration problems, but House Republican leadership won‚Äôt allow us to do that.The children must be reunited with their parents. https://t.co/Nbp22PpYivIt was an honor to welcome Rabbi Mark Schiftan of Nashville as today‚Äôs guest chaplain on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. https://t.co/zGB0rY7hp0 https://t.co/MUnfnMrRRnTrump‚Äôs family separation policy is cruel, inhumane and un-American. https://t.co/AGTRiWbEscTrump has the ability to stop family separations himself, but if the White House doesn‚Äôt act now, Congress must step forward and save these children.This policy is an unspeakable betrayal of America‚Äôs history. Kids are being damaged permanently every day. This is an embarrassment to the world and must end immediately.Today, I held a news conference to discuss President Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù policy which has resulted in separating children from their families at the border. https://t.co/nHrqpCdglVIt‚Äôs more important than ever to vote in EVERY election.

Other countries need to be held accountable for unfair trade. But using tariffs to pressure our partners into better behavior rarely works.

A cruel law that will only create new problems. https://t.co/GB7tePAZBbYet another school shooting in America. More loved ones taken from their families. Too many innocent lives lost.

We need to keep the government up-and-running, but not like this.Otherwise, we will be back in the same untenable shutdown position on February 8th.

Then the House should go along and keep the government operating.Senate Republicans and Democrats should compromise with each other fast before any more damage is done to the country. Then the House should pass what the Senate passes. There are plenty of existing compromisesIt is popular to criticize government, and to pretend that we don‚Äôt need it. But we are the greatest nation on earth because of our people and, also, partly because of our government, so it is a tragic mistake to harm either.Late at night, on a weekend, few people will notice that our government has shut down. But our nation‚Äôs enemies will notice, as will our increasingly worried allies. When government is shut down for more than a few days, every American will start noticing the damage.The federal government will shut down tonight at midnight if the Senate cannot find the 60 votes necessary to keep government operating. Never before in American history has this happened when one political party controls both the White House and Congress.Cooper Calls to Limit Congressional Pay if Government Shuts Down
