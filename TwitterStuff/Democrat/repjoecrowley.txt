The Trump administration is inflicting lasting damage on children fleeing violence‚Äîthere needs to be a plan to reunite these families. NOW. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/LzW86zwZ1zVoting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, Americans want the full freedom to vote back.

https://t.co/rAWt6ZpBSPDespite what President Trump wants you to believe, he didn‚Äôt end the family separation crisis ‚Äì he created it.
 
And he‚Äôs doing nothing to reunite these defenseless children with their parents. https://t.co/0sLCLHVYBC6 months ago, Republicans passed their #GOPTaxScam, giving massive tax breaks to special interests &amp; adding $1.8 trillion to our national debt.
 
Now, Republicans are using that debt to rationalize huge cuts to Medicare &amp; Medicaid. 
 
We‚Äôre not having it. https://t.co/TaWvQMkT3fJoined @MelindaKatz to chat with seniors at Woodside Houses about our fight to protect Social Security and Medicare from Republican cuts. https://t.co/ZfnPWxZFXSPresident Trump's forced separation of families has inflicted unfathomable damage on thousands of defenseless children.

I‚Äôll continue to fight these disgusting policies.Another day, another Republican attack on working families. They just passed a partisan, heartless #FarmBill that will cut $24 billion in food assistance for families in need. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAPPresident Trump has inflicted unspeakable trauma on thousands of children in order to further his anti-immigrant agenda. 

And his executive order will do nothing to help them recover. 

We must keep fighting for these kids.

Children are still separated from their families. They must be reunited. #FamiliesBelongTogetherI‚Äôm deeply grateful to all the New Yorkers who gathered at LaGuardia last night to welcome the children arriving from Texas. And I thank @MaketheRoadNY @UnitedWeDream, and @JewishAction for organizing. #FamiliesBelongTogetherIt is wrong to keep a parent away from their child. It is wrong to keep families caged up in detention centers. We must pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct now.No one is fooled: this order won't end the Trump administration‚Äôs despicable policy of indefinitely detaining families. 

These families, and America, deserve better than President Trump's blatantly anti-immigrant policies. https://t.co/7J7nPa7PLcShame on this White House, on everyone who is letting this happen.

#FamiliasUnidasMy good friend @RepGutierrez and I took to the streets last week to demand that President Trump immediately end his inhumane policy of ripping children from their parents. Read our op-ed in @eldiariony on the fight to end it üëá https://t.co/fA8FvA6mb7 #FamiliesBelongTogetherToday, we remember the 9 innocent lives lost 3 years ago at  Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Let us honor their memories by committing ourselves each day to stop the hatred and bigotry and by enacting common sense gun safety legislation.Becoming a dad was one of the happiest moments of my life. 

But this #FathersDay, all I can think about are the thousands of children separated from their parents at our border. #FamiliesBelongTogetherGorgeous day for a @FairAtTheSquare! Loved performing with my good friends @MarkGjonajNY and @Fernandez4NY https://t.co/NuNI17EMP6Thanks to @RepGutierrez,  @repjohnlewis , and @johncusack for joining in the fight against separating children at the border.

https://t.co/6TUpceWQteSix years after #DACA brought relief and stability to #DREAMers, these young adults have now been put in limbo thanks to the xenophobic policies of the Trump administration and the heartlessness of the Republican Congress. We must #protectDREAMers. https://t.co/jP8HLNSRfGLet's set the record straight: despite their claims, the new Republican "compromise" bill DOES NOT end family separation. Kids will still be taken away from their parents. And that is unacceptable. #GOPNonCompromise #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Kp11pXNZghYOU are the one tearing children away from their parents. You‚Äôre just too much of a coward to admit it. https://t.co/Re0zHrdBx5There are 40,056 homeless veterans in the United States today. That‚Äôs unacceptable.

Wish I could say the same for the children and parents at the border.Forcibly separating children from their parents will not only leave a scar on those children for the rest of their lives, but it will also leave a scar on the history of our country.

#NoOneAbovetheLaw, including the president. 

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm demanding the courts hold him accountable. #TrumpforSalePablo‚Äôs detainment also shows we must do more to protect @IDNYC holders. This is an important program that helps immigrant families thrive, and we cannot allow our neighbors to be targeted because they have municipal IDs.President Trump is tearing apart families at the border and in our communities. Pablo was detained while at work, earning a living for his two young daughters who may now grow up without a father. This is shameful and he must be released.

I‚Äôm for expanding transportation options &amp; support biking as a healthy, affordable transportation option, but the current proposal would upend the neighborhood.I‚Äôve heard from thousands of constituents about the proposal to add bike lanes on Skillman/43rd Ave. I cannot support the proposal as it currently stands.Tearing babies from their mothers‚Äô arms is inhumane and antithetical to everything we believe as Americans.

In #NYC, we have a growing crisis as more and more New Yorkers are being priced out of their neighborhoods.#NationalHousingWeekofAction is an important reminder of how much work we still have to do on providing safe #affordablehousing for all.Watch live as announce legislation to protect the rights of student veterans as they seek affordable housing. It's the next step of my #BetterDeal plan for #Queens and the #Bronx. https://t.co/vHq1xnm131President Trump is ignoring the worst #refugee crisis in history and abandoning the very values our country was built upon. That‚Äôs why I joined @BillPascrell and my fellow @HouseDemocrats to stop him from leaving these innocent people behind. Read here ‚Üí

Proud to present John with a flag flown over the Capitol in honor of his service! https://t.co/tXV7cF9rpUThe Trump administration‚Äôs changes to #TitleX puts the health of millions of women in danger.

Spoke with @rubendiazjr, @BertPizarro, @United4PR, &amp; a #HurricaneMaria survivor today in the #Bronx to discuss how we can make a difference. https://t.co/BLaeDpKh25LIVE: President Trump may have abandoned our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico, but #NYC will not leave our brothers and sisters behind. I‚Äôm discussing the island‚Äôs recovery with @rubendiazjr, @BertPizarro, and @United4PR #HurricaneMaria survivors. https://t.co/pOurU4nRsTFor years, @Dromm25, @FranciscoMoyaNY, @JimmyVanBramer, @MelindaKatz, @mgdendekker &amp; I have sought to fully repair and re-paint 7-line tracks in #Queens.
 
Thrilled to announce the @MTA will start fixing these aging train lines in June! More info ‚¨á
 
https://t.co/kKYHDrPd3nFor far too long, the residents of #Queens and the #Bronx have endured the deafening roar of airplanes. Congress recently took steps to mitigate aircraft noise and improve quality of life ‚Äì &amp; while more must be done, this is a move in the right direction. https://t.co/YsEQVSgk6bLIVE at 3:45pm: I'll be talking with @rubendiazjr, @BertPizarro, @United4PR, and #HurricaneMaria survivors in the #Bronx about what must be done to support #PuertoRico's recovery.

Tune in here: https://t.co/Gb9O44gHDADuring Asian Pacific American Heritage Month we pay tribute to the rich histories, cultures &amp; contributions #AAPI communities have made to our country. As we celebrate we must also reaffirm our commitment to elevating their voices. #APAHM18Later today, I‚Äôll be talking with @rubendiazjr, community leaders, and #HurricaneMaria survivors in the #Bronx about why more must be done to support #PuertoRico‚Äôs recovery. 

Tune-in at 3:45pm: https://t.co/Gb9O44gHDAThis #MilitaryAppreciationMonth, join me in thanking all those who have served or are currently serving in our Armed Forces. We are forever grateful. https://t.co/g2c3qEueO0Thomas Homan embodied the very worst of President Trump‚Äôs anti-immigrant mentality. I‚Äôll be closely watching to see who they attempt to nominate to lead ICE next. https://t.co/Nl6jydYoJmThis #MayDay, dedicated teachers are defending their dignity, fast-food workers are advocating for higher wages &amp; workers are protecting their freedom to form strong unions ‚Äì all reminders that the fight to ensure future generations have opportunities to succeed is far from over.New York‚Äôs criminal justice system is broken:
 
88% of the city's jailed population is Black or Latino
 
16,000 are behind bars waiting for trial
 
NY spends $350M keeping people in prison because they can't afford bail

Join me in celebrating our local #smallbiz community this week! https://t.co/sE9nfq8iRwThe #GOPTaxScam made the wealthiest Americans even wealthier. Now the Trump administration wants to TRIPLE the cost of rent for some of the poorest families in America. https://t.co/4JYAopr1wPWhat a wonderful and well-deserved tribute to @Dromm25's mother, a hometown champion for equal rights!

We must all work together to end anti-#LGBTQ harassment and discrimination and ensure that every school is safe and inclusive. #LGBTequality üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàThe report from House Intelligence Committee Republicans is further proof they were never serious about a thorough, nonpartisan investigation into Russia‚Äôs interference in our elections.
 
It was always about giving the Trump administration political cover.@jbendery @MEPFuller That's easy. It's out. Let's schedule a vote. https://t.co/v1nlREHHisThese rent hikes will worsen #NYC‚Äôs affordable housing crisis. Renters in #Queens, the #Bronx, and across the city deserve relief - that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working on policies like my #RentReliefAct that will support families. 

https://t.co/S5iW9BfgpHI asked for an investigation into why Speaker Ryan fired the House Chaplain and whether it was for a prayer urging Congress to consider all Americans ‚Äî including the poor ‚Äî in our work.
 
House Republicans just said no. https://t.co/Fm2tIAW8ERPresident Trump's deportation machine is being unleashed on 9,000 men and women who are trying to put their lives back together after Nepal‚Äôs devastating earthquake. This is another action motivated by cruelty, not our national security. https://t.co/Jaump7NpllAnti-competitive employment practices hurt workers and stifle competition. That‚Äôs why my colleagues and I are unveiling legislation to #EmpowerWorkers. https://t.co/CZbNPkUslbMick Mulvaney is on another rampage at the @CFPB. This time, he wants to hide information from the public on the wrongdoings of financial bad actors that have defrauded American consumers. https://t.co/daXQkU9L95üë∂üé∏üï∑üåß‚òÄÔ∏è #TakeYourChildToWorkDay https://t.co/JmYO0hMZ5Z#PollutingPruitt wants to cut @EPA's programs that protect Americans‚Äô health ‚Äì all while using taxpayer money on luxury travel and forcing those out who question his spending.

I sincerely hope his next candidate to lead the @DeptVetAffairs has the skills to help the beleaguered agency work for our nation‚Äôs veterans. https://t.co/fsISMiWJLZIt lacks vision and leadership from @realDonaldTrump to unleash the full strength of his deportation machine on a small number of Nepalese women and men who pose no risk to the U.S. My statement on TPS with @RepGraceMeng ‚Üì https://t.co/ogOBPN3m4A https://t.co/gPfoqQdSKxMike Clink, Ann Mincieli, &amp; Ivan Barias.

Glad my AMP Act passed the House so we can ensure great producers are paid for their music https://t.co/AWzpVjwD8sCouldn‚Äôt be prouder of #NYC‚Äôs Girl Scout‚Äôs Troop 6000 for reaching this incredible milestone! #GirlPower
 
https://t.co/I7qBxUbt5hThis headline says all you need to know about Scott Pruitt‚Äôs @EPA. He‚Äôs never been interested in doing his job to protect public health or the environment. It‚Äôs time to #BootPruitt. https://t.co/VKk8tyrs43This isn't about housing policy. This isn't about reform. It is about hurting struggling Americans. 

They're not even trying to hide their disdain anymore. https://t.co/IWxiZ21Ji7When I joined @RepDanKildee in #Flint, I saw first-hand the devastating impact the water crisis has had on the community. Lead poisoning is a real danger that must be taken seriously ‚Äì in Flint, and across the country. #DontForgetFlintCourt cases are temporary victories for #DREAMers. What these men and women need is legislative action. When will Paul Ryan open up his heart to allow a DREAM Act vote? https://t.co/B2eMgA2kvlPresident @EmmanuelMacron‚Äôs speech today showed more leadership than any of the addresses @realdonaldTrump has given in a year and half.This is a temporary success for #DREAMers, but we cannot rely on the courts alone to protect these young men and women. Congress must still act to make #DACA permanent. 

https://t.co/zRGa9VuXomI‚Äôm so proud of my colleagues in the House and Senate for passing the JUST Act and recognizing the importance of bringing greater justice to Holocaust victims, survivors, and their families.The World‚Äôs Fair is an iconic part of #Queens history, and I‚Äôm so glad that it‚Äôs legacy lives on through the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Fare‚Äù taking place in Citi Field this weekend! Be sure to check it out, #NYC.

https://t.co/Ayp1jZeQlIThank you to all the #NewYorkers participating in today‚Äôs #BodegaStrike in support of the Yemeni American community. We must stand together to say #NoMuslimBanEver!Let‚Äôs get this straight: President Trump called John McCain a ‚Äúloser‚Äù and the North Korean dictator "honorable." #TrumpLogic https://t.co/RhHF2Gwvzr#NewYork continues to lead the way on combating gun violence, now Congress must do the same. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain
 
https://t.co/XQ3mTOkVt0That‚Äôs why I joined @RepBarbaraLee and members of the @ProChoiceCaucus to condemn these efforts. Read our full statement ‚Üí
https://t.co/AzQdJTEIHF.@HHSGov is supposed to protect women's health, not play politics. This is censorship by the Trump administration, plain and simple.
https://t.co/aJiD7AvCAHThis kind of hate has no home in New York. https://t.co/arMFZMB1DaThe #GOPTaxScam, #TrumpBudget, and the so-called #PROSPERAct all have one thing in common: putting corporate profits over students and #workingfamilies. #StandwithStudents https://t.co/1ZnzCR86jSTeachers. Cops. Firefighters. Social workers. These are good careers that do good in our communities.
 
But the middle class is slipping out of reach for these public servants and too many others. We can't let that happen. https://t.co/nl1YuysI9a#EarthDay is our reminder that we all have an obligation to leave our world better off for generations to come. https://t.co/zP03u2sUxlCelebrating the Jewish Community Council of #PelhamParkway‚Äôs service to the #Bronx at their annual breakfast this morning! https://t.co/WC9GIBzPDQLittle know fact‚ÄîI moonlight as an unofficial tour guide of Queens. 

Let me know the next time you‚Äôre in town and I‚Äôll show you my favorite spots. https://t.co/uERe293vsrThe Trump administration‚Äôs complete disdain for the environment is alarming. Opening the #ArcticRefuge for drilling will devastate one of the planet‚Äôs most majestic places and harm the indigenous people who call it home.
 
We must #ProtectTheArctic. Now. Tomorrow. Always. https://t.co/gqvlStKWA3I joined the call for @FEMA to extend housing support to families displaced by #HurricaneMaria, and I‚Äôm relieved they are doing so.

But the Trump administration still must do MUCH more to help #PuertoRico.

https://t.co/KfHUPjSkxwMoving the World Trade Center Health Program would put the care our 9/11 heroes need at risk. 

This decision is just plain wrong. 
 
https://t.co/18fZBjPKfVAn entire generation has come of age since the horrific tragedy at Columbine. Their courage and determination to change America for the better is a continued source of inspiration. I join them in saying: #NeverAgain. #NationalSchoolWalkout https://t.co/fLo42bmwn1
