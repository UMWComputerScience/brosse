We are sick and tired of seeing little babies taken from their mothers. That's not right, it's not fair, and history will not be kind to us. As a nation and as a people we can do much better. We may have to turn America upside down to turn it right-side up. #KeepFamiliesTogetherThe right to vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool or instrument we have in a democratic society. We must use it. #goodtroubleThe time is always right to do right. Find a way to get in the way and we will make a way out of no way. #goodtroubleThere is no sound more powerful than the marching feet of a determined people. #goodtroubleDo not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble. #goodtroubleI never thought I would live to see a day when the Supreme Court of the United States would again make a decision as inhumane as Dred Scott v. Sandford or Korematsu v. United States. #StandWithMuslims #NoMuslimBanEverI was beaten, left bloody &amp; unconscious while friends of mine gave their lives to ensure that every person has the right to register &amp; vote. But five years ago the SCOTUS Shelby County v Holder decision stuck a dagger in the heart of the Voting Rights Act. We must #RestoreTheVRAMake no mistake: Today’s executive order fails to address or end this moral crisis. It merely replaces the unacceptable evil of family separation with the unacceptable evil of child detention. https://t.co/eNPDcNhokMSenator Robert F. Kennedy died fifty years ago today. When he passed, it was as if something died in all of us.  https://t.co/O3zYDMIRxuThank you, @ABCNetwork. You did the right thing. There is not any room in our society for racism or bigotry.Separating children from their parents is cruel, it is inhumane, and it is not in keeping with the moral values of our nation. It is simply un-American. I will fight this action with every fiber of my being. https://t.co/jyrwTPOxHOAs we face challenges and uncertainty around the globe, it makes no sense to turn your back to progress, to ignore the pleas of our allies, and to disregard wise counsel and hard core facts.  The price of peace is persistence, but the cost of war is always too high.To this very day, experts and allies agree that the agreement was working to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.Iran cannot have nuclear weapons—but the United States must be a headlight and not a taillight, leading the world on the path to peace through the hard, necessary work of diplomacy.Nearly 3 years ago, I supported the agreement after constant study, briefings, and discussions. During the debate on the House Floor, I warned that we could not let the perfect be the enemy of the good in the quest for nonviolence, especially when the alternative is nonexistence.Never before has the credibility of the United States been so undermined by a gross failure to honor our commitments.It is a sad and dark hour for our nation and the global family.  This administration’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is a major blow to all those working to bring peace to the world community.I believe we have a right to know what is in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. On this #EarthDay, we must resolve to do all that we can to leave this planet we call Earth a little cleaner and a little greener for generations yet unborn. #goodtroubleTo the young people speaking up and speaking out today, my heart is with you. Keep walking and keep marching all the way to the polls in November. You will change America. #NationalSchoolWalkoutI was saddened by the passing of Rev. F.D. Reese. I first met Rev. Reese in 1963 on my first trip to Selma. He helped create the climate for the Voting Rights Act. I’m terribly sorry for his loss, not just for Selma or the state of Alabama, but the nation. https://t.co/xk0FNRh6HV50 years ago today, I learned the painful news that my friend, my mentor, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been assassinated in Memphis, TN. He was my brother, my leader--that day it felt like something died in all of us. https://t.co/WkjkxJvXTCSometimes you have to get in trouble--good trouble, necessary trouble--to make a way out of no way.53 years ago today, we were beaten, tear gassed, trampled by horses, and left bloody on the bridge in Selma. On this anniversary, we cannot rest. We must honor those who gave their lives for the right to vote. We must continue to find a way to get in the way. #goodtrouble https://t.co/pryA7cFSM8I stand with @Delta58 years ago today, I was arrested for the first time as a participant in the sit-ins at lunch counters in downtown Nashville. Walking out to the paddy wagons, I tried to walk with a sense of pride &amp; dignity. I felt free, I felt liberated. I felt like I crossed over. #goodtrouble https://t.co/NSwsxarnvaNever has there been a more important time to guarantee that each voice can freely speak up and speak out. We cannot allow a few powerful companies to control what you see and do on the Internet. We must save #NetNeutrality to guarantee a free &amp; open internet for all #goodtrouble.@SpeakerRyan Mr. Speaker, the time for action is now. We know the facts. There are too many guns. How many more children must die? How many more students? How many more teachers? People who are not willing to lead should get out of the way.It is unbelievable, it is unreal that we consider a bill that turns the clock backwards and strikes a devastating blow in the fight for civil rights. https://t.co/3YMCscPeroWe are shocked and numb. How many more must die? Our conscience must move us to action. It is time for the American people to demand action from their elected leaders.This budget seeks to dismantle the social safety net. That is not right, it is not fair, and it is not just. Every person watching should understand that this budget is dangerous and unrealistic. https://t.co/oVqQJDzTESIf it hadn’t been for the march from Selma to Montgomery there would probably be no Barack Obama as President. I hope this conversation inspires young people to participate in the democratic process and understand that you too can make a contribution. We all have a role to play. https://t.co/BASjM7mMhiIt is painful to witness firsthand this attack on the remaining pillars of nonpartisan, governance, rules, and procedures, but it is unfathomable and unconscionable to attack our country’s national security personnel and apparatus for political cover and gain.The frantic, desperate release of this memo leads us down a dangerous path of political spin and accusations instead of thoughtful, responsible, congressional oversight.I never thought that I would witness the dismantling of the checks and balances of our country, and I never imagined that Republicans would cast aside the national security interests of our nation.This is a dark hour and a sad day in the history of our nation.  Congress has a constitutional responsibility to protect the goodwill of the United States and to serve as an inspiration to the global community for whom the dream of democracy is a beacon of hope and light.The movement lost another precious and devoted leader. Wyatt Tee Walker made a major contribution to the liberation and freeing of our nation. https://t.co/pmHdzDpqyXThere is no sound more powerful than the marching feet of a determined people. #goodtroubleInformation about Government Shutdown https://t.co/SCDUE6dwTxIt was good to be with you, Sen Booker.

As we push and pull for a more just and more equal society, Dr King’s campaigns against war, against poverty, against racism show us that love is the universal value of a society at peace with itself. #goodtroubleHe gave his life for us https://t.co/HF3qOMSXFkHe went to jail for us. #goodtrouble https://t.co/5kZT2OzXObHe marched for us. #goodtrouble https://t.co/lvC8drCSEbDr. King was my friend, my brother, my leader.

It is a day of service to our communities, to our brothers and sisters, and to generations yet unborn so that we all may continue Dr. King’s work of building the beloved community. #goodtrouble https://t.co/9xB7sRB6AFIf Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was preaching today, he would be speaking the idea that we are one people, one family, one house—the American house and the world house—that we must learn to live together as brothers and sisters, if not we will perish as fools.I am so proud that we were able to work in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to establish Georgia’s first National Historical Park in Dr. King’s name and legacy before what would be his 89th birthday and the 50th anniversary of his tragic assassination. https://t.co/dTRpRvoDYcCongratulations to @FootballUGA on a hard-won victory.

Failing to protect undocumented youth or reauthorize CHIP is cruel and inhumane. These young people are our future and they deserve better.Yesterday taxpayers stood up and spoke out against Republicans lining the pocket of their donors by any means necessary. Did you hear their cries? Can you feel their pain? You did not, Mr. Speaker. You chose to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. This bill is a shame and a disgrace.I’ve said on many occasions that you cannot get blood from a turnip, and you cannot justify robbing poor Peter to pay billionaire Paul. I urge all of my colleagues to be on the right side of history and to vote against this bill.Working and middle class families, the sick, the elderly, and generations yet unborn will bear the burden of this reckless act.I oppose this conference report with every bone in my body. This tax bill is a $2.3 trillion holiday gift for Wall Street, the rich, and the wealthy. Conceived in darkness and birthed with the help of donors and funders. This bill is not for the people. It is not tax reform.Today is the last day of #OpenEnrollment so do your part. Take care of yourself. Take care of your family.

Every person in this room knows what will happen nextMost importantly, how can you bury your head in the sand when there are grave issues facing our country?How can you attack immigrant children and DREAMers in a way that is just plain mean and heartless?How can you target the sick, the elderly, and the disabled?How can we punish teachers who are just trying to buy supplies for their classrooms?This tax cut legislation does not make the tax code any simpler or any fairer.
