#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/GUwXwR4Nr2More fear-mongering by @realDonaldTrump. He only wants to build his wall and rile up his base, so he’s denigrating immigrants and misusing ICE to achieve his goals. #AbolishICE https://t.co/squ0dhIoXZ.@realDonaldTrump has so misused ICE that it’s become a rogue agency, serving as his own personal security force while failing to address national security threats.

We’re going to keep fighting to #AbolishICE.
https://t.co/VXuY8ZuzOxNow that @realDonaldTrump has spent the morning tweeting out lies about his immigration policy, it's time to set the record straight.

RT this video if you agree we must #AbolishICE. https://t.co/NNCyGDH6AACall us whatever you want, @realDonaldTrump. We're going to keep calling your immigration policy what it is: cruel, inhumane, and un-American.

We will #AbolishICE. https://t.co/fq165mjgSvYou've also used ICE to terrorize communities, break up families, and implement a cruel, inhumane, and un-American immigration policy.

We must #AbolishICE. https://t.co/1pwRNos93r"ICE investigators say their association with the controversial immigration enforcement mission is making it hard for them to do their jobs."

@realDonaldTrump has so misused ICE that the agents can no longer work effectively. We must #AbolishICE.
https://t.co/a5THWFWChXInvestigations “have been perceived as targeting undocumented aliens, instead of the transnational criminal organizations that facilitate cross border crimes impacting our communities and national security."

Even @ICEgov agents agree: we must #AbolishICE
https://t.co/fdXO78vsiQWe must ensure that our immigration system treats people with dignity and respect. We can’t allow agencies to tear communities apart with cruel and outrageous actions.

Thank you, @IngrahamAngle for having me on your show to discuss my bill to #AbolishICE. https://t.co/GHVrAskB5tNow that we have @realDonaldTrump’s attention, let’s say it loud and clear: we must #AbolishICE

RT if you agree! https://t.co/n7swSq8a7bAfter the House overwhelmingly voted against @SpeakerRyan’s Immigration “fix” today, it’s good to see he’s spending his time on Twitter promoting the praise he's receiving. Kind of a @realDonaldTrump move, don’t you think? https://t.co/0z0Wnz1CDKUnder @realDonaldTrump &amp; Attorney General Sessions, @ICEgov has aggressively targeted immigrant communities and can no longer do its job effectively. Their actions of hunting down &amp; tearing families apart has created havoc across the country.
 
It’s time to #AbolishICE https://t.co/CXUNPIdUrUBREAKING: #SCOTUS struck a major blow to workers. By ruling in favor of #JANUS, #SCOTUS has sided with big corporations over working families. This will make it harder for everyday working Americans to bargain for better wages, safer working conditions &amp; good benefits. https://t.co/nJRKJe9PwHCorrection: this is a big loss for working families, Mr. President. When unions do well, the middle class does well. #Janus https://t.co/PqYRcQ27gaNow is the time to #AbolishICE. https://t.co/46KWyUDqqD#NIFLAvBecerra will let so-called crisis pregnancy centers deny women accurate information about their health. This decision undermines constitutional rights to basic healthcare &amp; interferes with the ethical obligation for providers to give accurate health information. https://t.co/ARwUaQmDzJTime &amp; time again, we have seen policies from @realDonaldTrump’s admin that discriminate against someone based on their skin color, race, gender or ideology.

By upholding Trump’s #MuslimBan, #SCOTUS has ruled in favor of religious intolerance rather than freedom &amp; equality. https://t.co/CCgO6WpSVTPeople are actually afraid when they see the word 'ICE,' whether they're in the U.S. legally or illegally. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump, the agency has an extremely damaged reputation and there's no trust left.

We must #AbolishICE. https://t.co/yKFzQg7Tny@realDonaldTrump I’m sure your rally tonight will be a good lesson in #civility

...or not.Wondering why I'm introducing a bill to #AbolishICE?

@realDonaldTrump has so misused the agency for his cruel and outrageous policies that it's now leading to issues like this ⬇️
https://t.co/6twh5fFWQR"Up to 160 American-born children have a parent who could soon be ordered to leave the country; many families are relying on handouts."

@ICEgov's raids are tearing apart families and ripping at the moral fabric of our nation. We must #AbolishICE.
https://t.co/T6scDh3gsqStories like this are why I’m introducing legislation that would abolish @ICEgov and crack down on the agency’s blanket directive to target and round up individuals and families. #AbolishICE https://t.co/QDkeagy7ub"National cases have stoked fears. One involved a woman who was detained by ICE agents last month while seeking domestic abuse protection at a TX courthouse. In VA, agents arrested men outside a church warming shelter."

This is an outrage. #AbolishICE https://t.co/SKPHdz8V1eMorristown, Tennessee fought back against ICE.

Now we're bringing the fight to Congress. #AbolishICE
https://t.co/T6scDh3gsq"The Trump administration has issued sweeping new guidelines expanding the range of immigrants that count as high priority for deportation, including low-level offenders, and those with no criminal record."

Just one of the reasons why we must #AbolishICE. https://t.co/XioHFJLSgeThe heartless actions of @ICEgov do not represent the values of our nation and the U.S. must develop a more humane immigration system, one that treats every person with dignity and respect.

RT if you agree it's time to #AbolishICE. https://t.co/XuOKdymdd7.@realDonaldTrump &amp; his team of white nationalists, including Stephen Miller, have so misused @ICEgov that the agency can no longer accomplish its goals effectively.

Now is the time to #AbolishICE. https://t.co/Mv6rJTXYSgFor this week’s #MagicMonday, we’re throwing it back to a trick I have been performing since I was in high school. I hope you enjoy this week’s trick! https://t.co/FiuMZEQQ7k“@GovWalker has made himself an enabler of @realDonaldTrump’s worst instincts. As such, Walker makes what is wrong with a very bad president very much worse.” https://t.co/vPbByq6Kk2"@GovWalker drew no line in the sand. He failed to stand up to cruelty. The governor remained what he has chosen to become: a cheerleader not just for @realDonaldTrump but for this president’s cruelest policies." https://t.co/vPbByq6Kk2I REALLY DON'T CARE (ABOUT YOUR LIES). DO U? https://t.co/ii57J1RpTqOh, so you DO care about federal issues! Did you finally find the courage to confront @realDonaldTrump over his family separation policy? Or did you decide to keep abandoning your so-called family values? https://t.co/H9efBlPAy9We must fight to make sure people with pre-existing conditions don’t have to worry about the threat of being denied health coverage.

Owen and his family don’t deserve to live with the fear of losing coverage at any moment. We need to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/HGfrEzYjuBThe @realDonaldTrump Administration is once again trying to prevent people with pre-existing conditions from getting health care.

Watch below to see how important it is to #ProtectOurCare so kids like Owen can receive the care they need. https://t.co/f9Momal830At $775 per child, per night, housing these children in the Trump Hotel in DC would be cheaper than locking them up without their families in the Trump Jail in Texas. #KeepFamiliesTogether
https://t.co/P2SQtZwVKXThanks to @mrdannyglover for coming to Capitol Hill for this very important discussion! #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/IHgmW6MuJ6While @realDonaldTrump signed an exec order to stop separating families, there’s still more work that needs to be done.

We must reunite families that have been separated &amp; stop forcing children to live in cages similar to those found in a supermax prison #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/HBSAJtCjfLI saw firsthand the disturbing conditions young children were being held in &amp; heard from mothers afraid they will never see their kids again.

Watch live now ⬇️ https://t.co/H5TrU6IDn5In Wisconsin, we have seen the harmful effects weakening unions can have in a community when @GovWalker attacked workers’ rights in 2011. Now, #SCOTUS is on the verge of weakening organized labor across the country. I proudly stand with #UNIONS in the #JANUSvAFSCME case. https://t.co/Lcr30EVTghWe’re live!

Steve, here’s my text in case you’re on Twitter. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/OlhQhJ38JxChildren are being ripped apart from their parents and it is currently the policy of the United States of America because of a decision by @realDonaldTrump.

This is an abhorrent policy and there is no way that we as Americans can allow it to continue. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/e8ruL3JJFyOn World Refugee Day, the U.S. should send a strong message to reaffirm our commitment to promoting the safety, health, and well-being of refugees. Every one of us has a moral duty to demand that @realDonaldTrump end his cruel and inhumane family separation policy. #WRD2018More governors are now refusing to send troops to the border over @realDonaldTrump's cruel, inhumane, and un-American family separation policy.

Why won't you join them, @GovWalker?
https://t.co/b8QlPdifggWhat we should spend $500 million on:
• Education
• Roads and bridges
• Public health programs
• Literally anything other than locking up kids in cages https://t.co/FFEkOOa1dbNot even 8:30 AM and the President is tweeting lies. #KeepFamliesTogether https://t.co/XFUc5hHsM6Tomorrow at 6pm Central, I’m hosting a FB live Q&amp;A on my recent trip to Texas, where I toured detention facilities &amp; visited the border. I saw first-hand how @realDonaldTrump’s policy of family separation is cruelly tearing apart families.

But they never ask about the children. Do they have an allergy?

Why won't @GovWalker join them? #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/pAtWuZm7wvHey @SecNielsen, I watched your press conference today where you wouldn’t confirm if you heard these children cry. Here’s the audio. You should listen. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/CO6Wj3WqrVBREAKING: @SecNielsen is lying on national TV right now about the Trump Administrations’s family separation policies.

Here are the receipts from a May 10, 2018 @nytimes article. https://t.co/Iftn1rxHKjHere are the facts:
• @realDonaldTrump berated @SecNielsen over border security
• Nielsen wanted to save her job and appease Trump
• Nielsen instituted the Administration's family separation policy
#KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/Ttyd7B6nTQWe might be a country of compassion and heart, but we're led by a President made of hate. We're better than this. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/OJ6docQu2iBorder Patrol and @SecNielsen want CBS to lie.

I went into these facilities yesterday. They are cages. https://t.co/sSj20dDMK0Children are also being used by some of the worst presidents on earth as a negotiating tool. If you “hate” seeing families separated, change your policies. If you don’t mind seeing babies ripped from their mothers, just keep being @realDonaldTrump. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/whPuYIU8QsLeaving Texas after a #FathersDayofAction and ready to bring the fight to #KeepFamiliesTogether back to DC.

@realDonaldTrump and @SecNielsen, end this cruel and outrageous policy.A lot of you have asked where the girls and younger children are held. The former Walmart detention facility houses boys 10-17. Girls and younger children are held at separate facilities. Unfortunately, some are as far away as Miami and New York. #wherearethegirlsThe final two stops today were a former Walmart that’s now a children’s shelter and a detention facility where we heard from moms who have been separated from their children and given no reason why. @realDonaldTrump this is pure evil. https://t.co/lV4ZOrswKythis 👏🏻 is 👏🏻 a 👏🏻 lie https://t.co/1K5ZOf6JZgI’m now headed to the Brownsville Children’s Shelter to get an answer on why these boys and girls are being separated from their parents with no guarantee on when they will see each other again. #KeepFamiliesTogether #FathersDayofAction https://t.co/W1SKSrDNJaJust weeks ago, this street was lined with people trying to seek asylum in the U.S. While there was an open waiting room, families sat for hours in the unforgiving heat.  @realDonaldTrump this is not how you treat people fearing for their lives and looking to the U.S. for help. https://t.co/4cNlhkaMKcJust visited this facility and can confirm that the conditions are horrific. Parents getting just 15 mins a day with their kids. Some immigrants waiting longer than a week to be processed. America, we’re better than this. #FathersDayofAction 
https://t.co/cVslqsbs3gJust made it to the Hidalgo Bridge, which is one of the places where people come to enter the country. Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump’s Administration is now separating immigrant families, even those that are presenting themselves to authorities to request asylum from violence. https://t.co/EmGbeIzf5EMy colleagues and I toured the border patrol processing center in McAllen, TX. When I asked how frequently family could see their children, they couldn’t give me a direct answer. The immigration policies of @realDonaldTrump and Jeff Sessions are cruel and wrong. https://t.co/AMplm7yx8LOfficials in McAllen say the goal is to process immigrants within 12 hours and definitely under 72. However, I spoke to people who have been there longer than a week. Unbelievable. #FathersDayofActionJust left the border processing center in McAllen, TX. Asked how much time parents get with their kids each day and officials couldn't give me an answer. They said it MIGHT be 15 mins a day. This is wrong. #FathersDayofAction https://t.co/FC4XwWRy4pJust landed in Dallas for a #FathersDayofAction. Next stop is McAllen and then on to Brownsville to see @realDonaldTrump’s child detention center and call on @SpeakerRyan and @HouseGOP to #KeepFamiliesTogether.“@realDonaldTrump has calculated that he will gain political leverage in congressional negotiations by continuing to enforce a policy he claims to hate — separating immigrant parents from their young children at the southern border.”

Absolutely shameful.
https://t.co/yXxFlIRhVdI applaud @USProgressives co-founder @SenSanders and constitutional conservative @SenMikeLee for leading a bipartisan follow-up to our call on @DeptofDefense to end the catastrophic Saudi and UAE attack on Yemen’s port, which could trigger mass starvation. https://t.co/brSCW6CGe8Another week and @EPAScottPruitt's scandals continue to pile up. @HouseGOP could have held him accountable, but instead voted down the amendment I proposed to fully fund the EPA's Inspector General.

How much longer will GOP put up with #PollutingPruitt?

It's not Democrats. Stop lying. https://t.co/GcrnETDAW7Sick and twisted that @EPAScottPruitt is weakening water protections for 100+ million Americans as a birthday gift to @realDonaldTrump.

While my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act, we desperately need to pass substantial gun reform in this country and we need it NOW.Rural schools, businesses, farmers and healthcare providers need high-speed broadband to provide adequate service to their communities and compete in the global economy. The #GOPfarmbill complicates #ruralbroadband funding, likely leaving these communities behind.Rural communities struggle to access capital for infrastructure and economic development. The #GOPfarmbill increases costs to financing by adding fees to Rural Development loans.I vow to #ProtectConsumers and will vote NO on S. 2155, the #BankLobbyistAct.
