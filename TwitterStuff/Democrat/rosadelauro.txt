We cannot become numb to the all too common gun violence. My thoughts are with all the families affected.My grandkids mean everything to me. I cannot imagine having them heartlessly ripped away. -Rosa #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/4bvVYpqRAnJanus was an attack on unions and the working families and communities they support. I stand with our union brothers &amp; sisters. No court case can stop our movement. #Union https://t.co/lsMZey5voFThe @FCC took away a free and open Internet, allowing corporations —  not consumers —  to choose what websites and applications we see online. That is why I support legislation in the House that will bring back #NetNeutrality and #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/xOiZrpmkcX.@realDonaldTrump’s Muslim ban was a hateful cornerstone of his campaign. By upholding it, the Supreme Court let hatred and fear win over our American values of openness and diversity. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/iUdpb8BxJFFamily separation at the border is causing lasting damage to all of the children involved. An executive order is not enough. @realDonaldTrump and his administration must immediately implement a plan to reunite these children with their parents. https://t.co/vpuhIGmyu9BIG NEWS: "Connecticut's Department of Social Services has taken the innovative and appropriate action and announced that effective July 1, 2018, it will no longer cover the costs of implanting the Essure sterilization device." https://t.co/o6xEqP8TLkCongress should also take up the Foreign Investment and Economic Security Act, which would defend the United States’ economic interests through a net benefit review of foreign investments.

https://t.co/kytTR8alulIt is clear that the @realDonaldTrump administration has no plan for reuniting the families it separated. This is outrageous, negligent, and cruel. We must continue the fight to #KeepFamiliesTogetherWhat we are seeing on the border is dehumanizing. Children are being terrorized, separated from their parents. These children need to be reunited with their families. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/PixWF6j3K9.@realdonaldTrump’s zero tolerance policy has separated more than 2300 children from their parents. This is child abuse, and it is causing irreparable harm to children. That is why this weekend I am headed to our southern border in Texas with my Congressional colleagues. https://t.co/314V8HqKPYThis is unacceptable—children must be reunited with their parents immediately. https://t.co/ebaaW60bdVPresident Trump’s executive order is little solace to the children and parents who have already been separated from one another. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/JDkqvSPf5hThe Senate made the right decision by rejecting billions in cuts to children's health insurance, medical innovation, advanced manufacturing, infrastructure projects, and the list goes on. https://t.co/K0Hvlv0S1x.@HouseGOP’s plan:
1. Cut taxes for wealthy CEOs &amp; shareholders
2. Explode the deficit
3. Demand spending cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition assistance, education, and more.
After passing the rigged for the rich #GOPTaxScam, today's #GOPBudget represents step 3.I support @RepJerryNadler's #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to stop the practice of family separation. #FamiliesBelongTogether and @RealDonaldTrump Administration’s policy is cruel and immoral—nothing more than child abuse. https://t.co/wKAKWG5J0FSeparating children from their families is child abuse. @realDonaldTrump and @DHSgov Secretary Nielsen must end this cruel policy. #FamiliesBelongTogetherEnd your policy of child abuse. -Rosa https://t.co/rEDTh3AEL2Separating children from their families is child abuse, and 158 Members of Congress have signed on to my resolution condemning @realDonaldTrump's policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/UD6jMJ9Z8kSeparating children from their families is not a partisan issue—it is a clear issue of right and wrong. https://t.co/qIwmXd3BTRPlease be safe today, drink plenty of water and stay inside and away from the sun whenever possible. https://t.co/3lzp76fCDnHappy Father's Day! https://t.co/juYL2tjXyTMUST READ: America is not ready to handle the next public health emergency.

We must do more to address this growing problem. https://t.co/yBpeLjfvVXDespite making up half the workforce, women on average still make just 80 cents for every dollar a man makes.  We must close the #wagegap and ensure women receive equal pay for equal work.The #PaycheckFairnessAct would hold employers accountable for discriminatory practices, end the practice of pay secrecy, ease workers’ ability to challenge pay discrimination, strengthen remedies for wronged employees, and prohibit employers from seeking salary histories.It's been 55 years since the #EqualPayAct became law, yet women still do not get equal pay for equal work. The #PaycheckFairnessAct would make real progress in the fight to eliminate the wage gap for women, families, and our economy as a whole. https://t.co/OiAhYINVWo53 years ago, #GriswoldvCT established our right to #birthcontrol access.

That is why Congress must act to ensure equal justice for all by passing the Equality Act. https://t.co/v7hjDdfhPQPunishing parents who are trying to save their children’s lives, and punishing children for being brought to safety by their parents by separating them is  not only cruel, but un-American. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/k8c6e5SEsHJune is #PrideMonth—an annual celebration of the tireless determination &amp; enduring struggle of the LGBTQ community.

We must have a comprehensive approach that includes #paidsickdays, #paidleave, &amp; affordable #childcare.I have introduced the #PaycheckFairnessAct in every Congress since 1997 to help close the #wagegap by giving workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination &amp; protect them from retaliation. #TalkPayToday is #MomsEqualPay Day — the day that the average mom’s pay finally catches up to what the average father made last year. We need to act now to close the #wagegap and ensure moms and all women receive equal pay for equal work.This is outrageous. Many of these deaths were caused by people’s inability to get proper medical care in a timely fashion, and may have been prevented if Puerto Rico was provided the resources necessary in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. https://t.co/h6lnRn34HuProud of @YaleLacrosse and @Wes_Lacrosse for bringing the NCAA DI and DIII national championship trophies back to Connecticut’s 3rd district for the first time.

Yet the @HouseGOP Farm Bill makes drastic cuts to programs that helps Americans from going hungry, all while giving massive benefits to the wealthy. We need to eradicate hunger, not anti-hunger programs. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/4ihQuTgzBWGlad we could get this accomplished @Call_Me_Dutch. @realDonaldTrump  needs to protect here in America, not China. #ZTEBailout https://t.co/EcPafvzXZjFACT: An estimated 2 million hungry Americans will be forced off SNAP by changes in the #GOPFarmBill. #HandsOffSNAPOn top of that, this bill puts VA medical facilities at risk of being shut down under the guise of “waste reduction,” which will leave veterans in underserved communities with few options for care.The VA MISSION Act pushes the @DeptVetAffairs down the path of privatization and could result in budget cuts to veterans care and other critical programs.Last night, the House passed the VA MISSION Act. While I fully support expanding caregiving benefits to pre-9/11 veterans—which is why I am a cosponsor of the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act—there were major flaws that could not be overlooked.The #GOPFarmBill gives massive benefits to the wealthiest while cutting BILLIONS from SNAP—which helps kids &amp; families from going hungry. https://t.co/hHGlVex5CyEvery year, the gap between investments made and investments needed for our nations water infrastructure system widens. We need robust public investment to ensure that all Americans have reliable access to clean water. #TimeToBuild https://t.co/YxK6vxVMQPThank you!

The House must follow and save #NetNeutrality https://t.co/stFmYrIfIwOur nation’s safety net should ensure that hungry Americans are able to put food on their table. But the @HouseGOP's Farm Bill seeks to cut support for American’s who need it most , undermining our nation’s values. 

https://t.co/bxcjHM0TsuDespite overwhelming public support, the Trump @FCC voted to end #NetNeutrality.

We need to make investments to fix our nation’s highways, bridges, rail systems, waterways, schools, and energy and telecom systems. A national infrastructure bank, not privatization, will make these investments possible. https://t.co/fYAVVAZ9tTCorporate consultants are helping schools dupe the Department of Education. These tricks costs borrowers and taxpayers money. Their reckless disregard for people’s lives is shameful—and it needs to stop.

https://t.co/5Y5MtGuABT.@HouseGOP’s farm bill would cut free school meals for 265,000 children across the country. It is shameful to rob our students’ potential in order to give massive tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy. #SaveSchoolMeals https://t.co/QekAO0Z3ovThis new report by @CTHealth shows how many people in CT benefited from the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. We cannot let up in the fight to protect the ACA and Medicaid. https://t.co/ShKj1oXEWLInstead of working to prevent American jobs from being outsourced, @realdonaldtrump is focused on helping foreign companies. https://t.co/iqcPw72ojdHappy Mother’s Day! https://t.co/TF9at7rznII can’t say I’m surprised that the President’s proposals are just another gift to Big Pharma. I will continue to fight lower prices, and stop the price gouging.My bill would protect consumers from misinformation and advertising that promotes unnecessarily expensive prescription drugsFinally, I’ve introduced the Responsibility in Drug Advertising Act that places a three-year ban on direct-to-consumer advertising of newly approved prescription drugs.I’ve also long supported the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act, which would allow individuals and pharmacies to buy drugs from other countries that are equally as safe as drugs sold here, but significantly more affordable.My bill would give the government the authority to regulate the price of prescription drugs and ensure no American’s health is threatened by corporations who put profits above people.This week, I introduced the Prescription Drug and Medical Device Price Review Board Act, which prevents drug and medical device companies from gouging consumers with excessive prices.The President should have kept his promise and allowed Medicare to negotiate to lower drug prices. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which would help our seniors.President Trump’s prescription drug price proposal fails to truly tackle the exorbitant costs that millions of hard-working individuals and families are struggling with.Ebola has re-emerged in central Africa, threatening countless lives—yet @HouseGOP has cruelly cut funding to programs that support health security with their rescission package, all in order to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the rich. https://t.co/q3ZmdlCyMr@CSPI This was a tough fight—filled with years of delays, industry pushback, and lawsuits. Nevertheless, we prevailed.

Last year alone, SNAP prevented more than 42 million people from going hungry—including nearly 20 million children, 4.8 million seniors, and 1.5 million veterans. @HouseGOP is betraying our values by pushing their blatantly one-sided and cruel Farm Bill. https://t.co/WZDr3T8rRuMothers are breadwinners in half of families with children under 18. That’s why Moms need the #FAMILYAct—so that having a child or taking care of a seriously ill loved one doesn’t mean losing several weeks’ worth of wages. #MothersDay #paidleave https://t.co/Q3Old4qv1DWhat moms need: Quality, coordinated, woman-centered healthcare. What #momsdontneed: the @HouseGOP’s continued attacks on the #ACA and reproductive rights. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/6Xs2tzsuNd#Momsdontneed to choose between a child’s health and a paycheck.

We must invest in our teachers and give them the tools to grow strong and healthy minds.Congress needs to act on gun violence prevention measures. The people, our kids, are demanding action. #Team26 #En… https://t.co/VoByFunbSGGreat to be a part of #StrollingThunder here at the Capitol—fighting to make sure our babies &amp; families get the care and services they need. https://t.co/JJgA9PYXSaIf they want to fix our nation’s growing deficits, they could easily find the money by eliminating outrageous tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, rather than taking money away from working families.Their $1.5 trillion spending spree, cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, has clearly given them buyer’s remorse. But that is no excuse to take resources away from children and their families.More than 17,000 children and their families rely on the Children's Health Insurance Program in Connecticut—and @realDonaldTrump &amp; Congressional Republicans’ are planning to take money away from them. That is appalling.FINALLY: after 8 years of delays and industry pushback, consumers will have the calorie information they need to make informed decisions.
