This administration has shown it is too weak to try to #KeepFamiliesTogether.

The U.S. used to lead the world; now the Trump Admin is an anchor dragging us to the bottom. https://t.co/6Pbo6Zz3W4We can’t let ourselves feel powerless at a time like this.

It’s my favorite quote and it continues to inspire me – it’s both a memorial and a call to action. The service members we honor today understood courage better than most of us ever will.

He’s the kind of leader our country needs. https://t.co/BhyKW5VpdnThank you Armed Services Chair @MacThornberry for having the courage to "counsel against" abandoning the #IranDeal. @realDonaldTrump threatens to rip it up – but can't say how he'd get a better deal. (He can't.) #JCPOA is the best way to prevent Iran from building a nuke. https://t.co/C6MJKMUtG7Glad these resources will be delivered to Salem! Adding more transit options will support jobs and unlock opportunity on the North Shore. https://t.co/cX25EoxRBsGrateful to the @FairfaxDems for inviting me to join them tonight. I’m proud to be in this fight with you. https://t.co/wWLzwOi8schttps://t.co/sEM4k6f3Nthttps://t.co/hX0asYjvCfhttps://t.co/OEQvMr6kdGAbout to take the stage to talk to @FairfaxDems about how the next generation of leaders will keep America’s promises. Stay tuned for my staff to send some of the messages from my speech...We’re not going to solve the problems facing Americans today without bold leadership and new ideas. Grateful to @MichaelPfleger, @formyblockchi, @linares76, and @LexSims13 for providing that leadership and for showing me the changes they're making to improve Chicago. https://t.co/f9kx6uMhqPThat's a terribly inefficient use of your time and VA resources. This is exactly why we need a qualified manager in charge of the VA, not @realDonaldTrump's personal doctor. https://t.co/Zax4Sdk1vBCouldn’t agree more with @speechboy71 here. VP Pence is an embarrassment to America who needs to re-read the Constitution before going back to work. https://t.co/DM4QWm8mSD"$17.4 billion, or 44.3 percent of the total — will go to roughly 200,000 Americans making $1 million or more who claim the pass-through deduction"

@GOP keeps calling their tax scam a "middle class tax cut". Do they think millionaires are middle class? https://t.co/YNvmG6Op1XGuess you can’t see the Statue of Liberty from Trump Tower.

“Give me your tired, your poor,  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..."

There’s nothing courageous about turning our backs on our neighbors. https://t.co/ptLBsuNx4qWhile Trump bickers about yet another failed nominee, the people he’s really hurting are veterans. We need leadership at the VA! Vets didn’t want Ronny Jackson—he was unqualified from the start. Fellow veteran Paul Rieckoff explains: https://t.co/SgRLMZv2BmIt takes courage to answer the call to serve—again—and we need more leaders like RD in Washington…even if it takes a few tries to get there. Proud to have supported him and his team. Now let’s re-focus on winning VA-5 this fall! https://t.co/mTVtpmXpbhIt’s #SmallBusinessWeek, and I couldn’t be more proud to recognize the companies that make cities and towns in #MA6 so special. Congratulations to George and all the @Shubies family who celebrated their 70th anniversary last weekend! https://t.co/zzGfGneB49Excited to announce my support for @RachelReddick! She’s fought for victims of domestic abuse and served our country as a Naval officer. Now, she's answering the call to serve Pennsylvania in Congress. https://t.co/oJYr5qaSHRThere have been ZERO right whales born this season, a sign of the unprecedented crisis our environment is facing. This is just one of many steps we need to take to protect our natural resources for generations to come. https://t.co/Kw469MtPr2By showing up for town halls, people are standing up and saying, “We want to participate in our democracy! We are ready for change!”

Things fundamentally won’t change unless we change Washington. So thanks to all who participated – let's keep it up! https://t.co/5ORiAQgwSzDo as I say, not as I do. https://t.co/3hNGUKR7wrSo glad the state’s "unwritten 'wait-your-turn' rules” don’t apply here. We should find the best people to represent us, whether or not they’ve been waiting around. https://t.co/mOVxUUPslS.@SpeakerRyan fires the House chaplain for praying about protecting the poor, but can’t fire Rep Nunes for not protecting our democracy from Russia’s preying cyber attacks.I'm proud to support @projectbread – they're celebrating the 50th #WalkforHunger on May 6. Walk funds are distributed to hundreds of local #antihunger programs across MA. Register at https://t.co/fzJckUvzeE to join this tradition and #makehungerhistory! https://t.co/7Og68QQbklVeterans' lives are literally hanging in the balance. We need a qualified individual with integrity at the helm of the VA, not the closest doctor within arm's reach of @realDonaldTrump.There is bipartisan support for protecting Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. This is an important step, but now @SenateMajLdr must allow a vote on the Senate floor. https://t.co/XbRihMSaROScaling back the use of science at the Environmental Protection Agency is like scaling back the use of textbooks at the Department of Education. https://t.co/qYdfaTWpNWThanks for having me, @hughhewitt! https://t.co/zaLp6NWpWLAlso virtually unexplained: why Republican leaders in Congress won't allow a vote to prevent members of our communities from being deported. Most Americans – red, blue, green, you name it – support a solution. Let's give these young men and women the opportunity they deserve. https://t.co/FI4v7GVfOYOur government shouldn’t work this way. “Pay to play” politics has failed too many Americans. This is exactly why we need a new generation of leaders who know what it means to serve. https://t.co/tUKTxfzyMWWe must continue to stand with allies like France and hold Iran accountable under the framework of the #IranDeal. The world already has one rogue nuclear threat in North Korea – there is no reason to create another one.Earlier this month, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dunford, told me during an Armed Services Committee hearing that Iran continues to abide by the terms of the deal.The deal has, and will continue to, prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and has subjected Iran to unprecedented monitoring. Just last month, the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East told Congress “it is in our interest to stay in the Iran nuclear deal.”Macron is encouraging us to do something smart: keep Iran from getting a nuke. Trump has called for the #IranDeal to be ‘ripped up,’ which gives Iran free reign to build a bomb. Let’s join with our allies and keep the deal while pressuring Iran on Hezbollah, Syria, missiles, etc.It's an honor to welcome President @EmmanuelMacron to a joint session of Congress this morning. America is fortunate to have a strong bilateral relationship with France despite the chaos in our White House.Tonight, @hiral4congress is closing the gap in #AZ08 -- a district that elected @realDonaldTrump by 21 points. Regardless of the outcome, this shows what's possible when volunteers get engaged. If you want to see change, get involved before #November6thAmericans have had enough of the chaos in Republican-controlled Washington. https://t.co/NwsBJvfXGeIf the allegations of improper behavior by @realDonaldTrump's nominee to run the VA are true, they are deeply troubling. Millions of veterans – myself included – are counting on the President to put partisan politics aside and appoint a qualified leader to manage their care.This is great news for young women! 

Health care should be based in facts, not politics. https://t.co/a0N3mmh3HdLet’s build an America that values and respects public service. https://t.co/I9hNqd5vI4On #EarthDay, let’s remember that protecting the planet for future generations does not need to keep Americans out of work. We can – and should – make environmentally friendly decisions that support jobs and our economy.The Trump Administration's response to Hurricane Maria has been wholly inadequate. Seven months after the storm, Americans in PR still lack reliable access to basic necessities. I've been calling for investment in the power grid since my visit in January: https://t.co/RWCZNzeIIzRep Miceli dedicated himself to serving the people of Wilmington and Tewksbury. Liz and I send our heartfelt condolences to his family and his constituents. https://t.co/SavtkaMiiWWith Trump in the Oval Office, we need more in Congress with the experience to lead on national security.

"As the number of Congressmen, Senators who've served in the military has fallen, Congress has tended to let Presidents decide about use of force" https://t.co/ME8lQyVf1fNearly a year ago, I asked @usedgov to work with other federal agencies to help disabled Americans discharge student loan debt. This week, they partnered with the VA: https://t.co/G87h6c3wVo

It's a good first step for our vets, but we can do more to ease the paperwork burden.It's not complicated: students deserve to be safe in their classrooms. Nineteen years after Columbine, I stand with everyone participating in #NationalWalkoutDay. We can't let gun violence be normal.Most Democrats and Republicans agree that young Americans brought to the US as children deserve to remain in the only country they've ever known. Over 200 members are sending a message to the Republican leaders blocking a vote: we must resolve this manufactured crisis.Secretary Mattis is right: Congress has the power—as elected representatives of the people—to declare war.
 
Not the president. 

https://t.co/AtzUzhVC0YIf the GOP governor of a state with rural areas and plenty of hunting like VT can support comprehensive, commonsense gun safety legislation, Congress can too. @SpeakerRyan, how many more lives will we lose waiting for you have the courage to act? https://t.co/UyOaAAyYg4Mrs. Bush served our country with dignity and grace. Liz and I send our thoughts and prayers to both Presidents Bush and their families. https://t.co/Dt2llOEMunIt is also your job to protect the Constitution and the rule of law, @SenateMajLdr. https://t.co/eQ1HLEZarcOnce again, the President is blocking sanctions on Russia, this time contradicting his own administration to do so. Russia must face consequences for supporting the Syrian regime's chemical weapons program – and Americans deserve to know why @POTUS won't stand up to Putin.On #TaxDay, let's set the record straight. https://t.co/c0wgd74vzVhttps://t.co/wlSERcjXshOorah! (And it’s about time) https://t.co/1YFggQL8VpWhat she said 👇 https://t.co/lq8vfNcLY6We’ve launched more missiles at Syria this year than we’ve accepted Syrian refugees. 

Leading the free world means showing strength when necessary and compassion whenever possible. Our country is doing one — we can’t forget the other. https://t.co/0SkiGwxLK7Wishing good luck to @Dennis_Magnasco, who serves on my team in Salem, and the rest of the military relay team running the @bostonmarathon today. They're running to mark 100 years since the Marathon was cancelled due to WWI: in 1918, they ran a military relay competition instead. https://t.co/w0R5lO6zN9Food insecurity affects as many as 1 in 6 people in our community. I’m proud of the work @TheOpenDoorMA does every day to help feed hungry families, and I’m grateful to the volunteers who joined my team and I to help out there today. #OneBostonDay https://t.co/Uoahm0ZeIHGood luck tomorrow! #BostonStrong https://t.co/5SA5Slx37mA white man in America can be convicted of obstructing justice and get a Presidential pardon. But if you’re black, you get arrested for meeting your friend at a coffee shop.
https://t.co/XZZWoZ9pcjAnyone who uses chemical weapons should be stopped. That includes Assad and the Russians. But we’ve seen this before, we’ve tried this response before, and it clearly failed. We need a strategy, Mr. President, not a series of contradictory tweets.Yesterday I reminded Sec Mattis that, in Iraq, he gave us a clear mission and told us what we needed to accomplish to go home. Then I asked about Syria, and he said the troops can go home when they defeat ISIS.

So what part of that strategy is this?“Sustained response” = war. And that requires the authorization of Congress - unless you don’t believe in the Constitution. https://t.co/5jKuoPlKl9All Americans, but especially our troops on the ground, should be asking what our strategy is in Syria. Why will this strike work when Trump’s last one failed? When will @POTUS make up his mind about leaving or staying? How does this end...? https://t.co/xSUdTSwHR9At every turn, @realDonaldTrump tries to drag us back to the past. Watch his nominee for Secretary of State try to deny that #LoveIsLove 👇 https://t.co/Tj020alOBDFor more of Lili’s story, visit https://t.co/pyhricT26ZToday we remember her and the 6 million men, women, and children killed in the Holocaust for the "crime" of being Jewish. In the face of a resurgence of global antisemitism, we must never let such evil to take hold again. #HolocaustRemembranceDayThat was the last note from Lili Jahn to her children. She was murdered less than a month later in Auschwitz.“And now goodbye again, all of you—Gerhard, Ilse Mouse, Hannele Child, little Eva, and my precious Dorle! May God protect you!

Today, @ConorLambPA was sworn in as the next Representative for #PA18. 23 to go. #FlipTheHouse #November6Congrats to my friend and MA colleague @RepMcGovern on his new role as Ranking Member of @RulesReps! We need his steady leadership to fight back against the disastrous @HouseGOP agenda. https://t.co/ETCrGxaVFePompeo has also expressed support for bringing back torture, wants to continue indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay, and supported legislation as a Congressman that attacked LGBT rights.

Is this who we want as the face of U.S. diplomacy across the world?Pompeo has downplayed evidence the CIA – which he directed – and others provided as part of the comprehensive review of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.(This position is also dangerous for the North Korean nuclear crisis, where the costs of war would be catastrophic. Smart and tough diplomacy is critical to our way forward – but how does that work if we ruin our credibility by abandoning the nuclear deal with Iran?)On the #IranDeal, the best viable option we have for Iran, Pompeo: repeatedly called for it to be ripped up

Generals – who know the only other option is a military one – like our top commander for the Middle East: we should stay in the deal https://t.co/nZPW27P0zoTrump's nominee for Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, has his confirmation hearing this morning. Let's take a look where he stands...After the 9/11 attacks, @ElissaSlotkin felt called to serve. She ended up doing 3 tours in Iraq. Now, she's answering the call to serve again. She's running for Congress to serve people like her mom, who didn't have health insurance when she was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. https://t.co/wBQXBnGgXADeporting honorably discharged veterans is shameful and illegal. It's disgraceful that our government is failing to uphold the values this man volunteered to put his life on the line to defend. https://t.co/Ck0jLdln4kThe blue wave is real, and it just swept away Paul Ryan. #November6It is past time for the President to present a clear strategy for our role going forward, and for Congress to debate a new authorization for military force in Syria. Failing to do so is not fair to our service members risking their lives every day or to the American public.America is at our best when we lead based on our principles. We have seen a lot of mixed messages from the White House, but no strategy and no leadership. We have read a lot of tweets, but see no plans to act with compassion, and save refugees while we still can.The Assad regime’s chemical attack on civilians is a heinous war crime. We must work with our international partners to further isolate the regime and its sole remaining backers - Iran and Russia - and hold them accountable for their actions.Sorry to hear that, Saba. One example is a requirement in the omnibus spending bill that passed a few weeks ago that all veterans be entitled to mental health screening and care and that the VA provide an annual report to Congress. But the simple answer is not enough. https://t.co/RDZV394Jj4For some reason, paying workers fairly is still up for debate. I’m in constant admiration of the work my wife @liznmoulton does to empower women in their careers. On #EqualPayDay, let's acknowledge that we've come a long way – but not far enough. https://t.co/UA6g5wHdA7The Army's Advanced Research Lab makes sure our soldiers have the most up to date, cutting-edge technology possible. Their work can literally be life-saving. I'm so proud to welcome them to our district, where they'll have access to world-class researchers and facilities. https://t.co/Wwb6afg1yVCongratulations to you and your family @SenDuckworth! https://t.co/CMKYvXPNugExcited to welcome @APLHeureux – my Chief of Staff starting today – to Salem! Alexis brings a vast level of experience to this role and I'm proud to welcome her to @teammoulton. Looking forward to working with her to continue serving #MA6 and the USA. https://t.co/LJztE2f75B.@JoshButnerCA50 is a proud Democrat who volunteered to serve our country as a Navy SEAL. When the people of #CA50 send him to Congress, he will put people over politics. Reject the political games and support Josh here: https://t.co/ZHTSW2pdblThis case proves what most Americans already know to be true: we can take common sense steps to get weapons of war off our streets without infringing on the Second Amendment. This is a victory for gun safety, and I'm proud of @maura_healey and Massachusetts for leading the way. https://t.co/qeq3zTLjezA new generation of leaders is making their voices heard loud and clear: #NeverAgain. And if elected officials won't answer their call for change, we'll elect new ones. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/vUv4yPUkSYThis is what leadership looks like. https://t.co/zcgV7Ac7OzWest Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona...

This is pretty simple. Pay the teachers, and buy the kids some new books. https://t.co/z02qgO2BhsSending the National Guard to the southern border does nothing to fix our broken immigration system and it strains our already over-taxed troops.Today is the 50th anniversary of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. He showed us by his example what it means to dedicate your life to a cause in service to others, and although he is gone, his words will forever be a guide to a more equal and just society."Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve. You don’t have to have a college degree to serve. You don’t have to have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve...You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love." #MLK50Jobs in emerging tech grew by 20% in Mass last year – but after the #GOPTaxScam, we have $1.5 Trillion less to invest in helping Americans succeed. Even if the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" created any jobs, not enough Americans would have the skills to do them! https://t.co/dSCMFFkK5CThanks for the shoutout, @plain_language. We agree – short, simple words are great, but they're not helpful when there's pages and pages of them in one letter or they contradict one another! That's why our #TLDRAct makes any action items for taxpayers clear, at the top of pg 1. https://t.co/YYYSpwvPtySo proud to see the progress being made in Lynn. This is what it's all about: "We’re trying to get the kids involved, to take some pride in the city." https://t.co/FsyRGWEhQX“As I prepare to leave government, I am struck by a recurring thought: It should not be this hard to serve your country.”
https://t.co/ICobDuTwk2This is truly insensitive and inhumane and does nothing to make our communities safer. https://t.co/dzkceti5bWIn the Marines, we ran towards problems – not away from them. I'm doing all I can to support these men and women who are answering the call to serve again because we need more leaders with that attitude: Washington is broken. Let's fix it. https://t.co/kH00U6YW0wSo many fond memories of spending time with my brothers and sisters on Easter Sunday. From our family to yours, Happy Easter!Happy Passover for all those gathered with friends and family around the seder table this weekend."Since Sandy Hook, more kids have been victims to gun violence than the number of US troops killed since 9/11." 

Proud of Army vet and candidate for Congress in #NY19 @PatRyanNY19 for speaking out about the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/aWIE9J6gOb #VetsForGunReformThere are fewer veterans serving in Congress right now than almost any other time in our history.

Why should we elect more veterans? I’ll let @McCreadyForNC take this one. https://t.co/0kI8MGalAoWe have a chance to elect leaders – like @MaxRose4NY – who know firsthand the life and death consequences of decisions made in Congress. https://t.co/9siuYKZoP7Can you imagine a more egregious abuse of power than offering the Presidential pardon to witnesses to potential crimes (who themselves have pleaded guilty)? https://t.co/OBmg9wo7owThe odds were against Democrat and Marine vet @ConorLambPA in a district Trump won by 20 points, but he proved to voters that he's a leader who will put people over politics. 

This year, we can elect service-driven leaders like him all across the USA. https://t.co/MmAQBZR45cThis is a transparent attempt to rig the 2020 census despite the Constitutional requirement that all residents be counted. It's yet another example of Trump putting his anti-immigrant agenda ahead of sound policy making and will face court challenges. https://t.co/CqEqVlDLAJAs a veteran, a member of Congress, and an American, I hope we can move past this chaos. I will continue my work to improve care at the VA for the men and women who served.Veterans put their lives on the line for our country. Now caring for their lives is our responsibility, and we owe them the best healthcare in the world – not the the dysfunction of @realDonaldTrump administration. https://t.co/O2iNxF5czOThree months into 2018, our Serve America candidates

✅ Flipped a district that elected Trump by 20 points blue for @ConorLambPA
✅ Won a primary overwhelmingly in Illinois

Midterm elections are on #November6th.

If your representative won’t summon the courage to act so we can put an end to gun violence, you know what to do. #Enough https://t.co/xyfSlR1unGProud of you all for leading the charge to make our communities safer. We can make change if we all come together and keep at it, so keep doing what you're doing! https://t.co/zFqRWTmQrMThanks to generous grassroots support, our campaign provided 300 high schoolers and supporters with train tickets so they could join the #MarchForOurLives in Boston today. #RailToRally

We asked some of them what message they wanted the March to represent. #NeverAgain https://t.co/CirbtOi2JbMassachusetts has some of the strongest gun laws in the country, and they work: in 2016, our state had the lowest rate of gun deaths per capita in the United States.

There are common sense changes we can make to protect innocent lives that don't conflict with #2A rights. https://t.co/c84Em9ayc3Midterm elections are on #November6th.

This cannot keep happening in America. We have to stop this.
https://t.co/hy074OmGLqAnother step backwards for an administration already going full throttle in reverse. If you’re worried about our national security today, you should be more concerned about it tomorrow. https://t.co/R7hgtBvs24In my short time in Congress, I’ve learned it’s a lot easier to find a reason to vote against something than to vote for something. Although the omnibus bill contained provisions I wouldn’t support on their own, I believe it addresses important priorities overall.We’re still not doing nearly enough to prepare Americans to succeed in the economy of the future. We should be investing a lot more in apprenticeships and skills education – programs like the one my #CHANCEinTech Act would create. https://t.co/QiMtmda4LZThere are a lot of good things in the #omnibus, but it’s not perfect. It includes funding for the border wall, which experts agree is not an effective way to secure our border (and which @realDonaldTrump promised MEXICO would pay for, not taxpayers).This bill grants the Army Corps of Engineers the resources our community needs for future harbor maintenance projects in Newburyport.One of my top priorities in Congress is making sure every American who wants to serve our country has the opportunity to do so. This bill advances that goal by increasing the budget of the Corporation for National and Community Service, which runs programs like @AmeriCorps.It includes critical health care resources: new funding to combat the opioid crisis, more resources for our Community Health Centers, and more funding to train Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners. There's currently no SANE in my district, so I'll fight to bring this funding to #MA6.No matter what @realDonaldTrump says, Russia is an adversary and a threat – look no further than their invasion of Crimea. That’s why I’ve been calling for us to support our allies by fully funding the European Resilience Initiative, which this bill does.This bill supports our troops: it gives them a pay increase. (And, it rejects a pay increase for Members of Congress like me.)The omnibus includes $30 million in grants for collaborative partnerships and research to address coastal resiliency. The man-made threat of climate change is threatening coastal #MA6 communities, and these resources will help us adapt.This bill funds a pilot program to extend broadband internet to rural areas. I’ve been calling for this for years, and I introduced legislation to help small businesses access high speed internet. https://t.co/99FeBrpl3iI just voted in favor of the #omnibus spending bill to fund the government. This bill ensures funding for a lot of important programs.This week @RepStefanik and I introduced a bill to require foreign media outlets operating in the US to disclose ties to foreign governments. Not a moment too soon...
https://t.co/oVH2zRW3luAmericans deserve to know when foreign powers are funding propaganda on our airwaves, like Russia is doing with their channel RT. @RepStefanik and I introduced the Countering Foreign Propaganda Act to require media outlets to disclose their ties to foreign governments. https://t.co/h5G9XYXVxs.@repjohnlewis was 25 years old when he led the march across Edmund Pettus Bridge. This weekend, with the #MarchForOurLives, we will once again ask the nation's youth to lead us into the future – to help us build a better America.On this day in 1965, the marchers from Selma arrived in Montgomery.

Nothing more powerful than learning about history from a leader who shaped it. https://t.co/FMaRK4n02LCongress has to fund the government by the end of the week, and once again, GOP leadership has left us totally in the dark about what's in the bill – but the lobbyists somehow got a draftWhen you get a statement from your credit card company, any action you need to take is stated clearly at the top of the first page.

Hear my wife Liz talk about the importance of women in leadership at the North Shore Women in Business Symposium on Thursday: https://t.co/h3xcLndj1WWhat he said. https://t.co/Q0Jw5AecD3This Saturday, students and members of our communities will take a stand against gun violence, and the organizers of #March4OurLives Boston need your help. Contribute here to support the young people who are refusing to accept the status quo: https://t.co/LAkneR921L @MFOLBostonEveryone should be able to vote, and every vote should matter. This decision is a good start. Here’s what’s next: 
1. Eliminate gerrymandering nationwide 
2. Fight voter suppression tactics
3. Make voting day a national holiday
4. Implement automatic voter registration for all https://t.co/Dh4TbB1owJLast week, these students in Maryland took a stand against gun violence. Today, there was a shooting in their school.

Our kids can't wait. We must act now. https://t.co/fwbaECDI26Now more than ever we need to put country over party. Thank you @RepStefanik for having the courage to support the Special Counsel. https://t.co/2SszNrNCtXRight and wrong should not be defined in this country by the whims of a small, scared man who is terrified of losing the power he never should have been given.

If Donald Trump fires Robert Mueller, impeachment proceedings should start the next day. https://t.co/Jr4F1O2nWE"May the road rise up to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine warm upon your face;
the rains fall soft upon your fields and until we meet again,
may God hold you in the palm of His hand."

#HappyStPatricksDay ☘️Would be happy to consider this. The Sixth District of MA would benefit from the wisdom and talent of such an experienced public servant. https://t.co/ynQWhdzQpCI stand with @JessJTang, @BTU66, and the brave students who stood up this week to say #NeverAgain. https://t.co/Su7bbn6XaMCongratulations @STheken and everyone in the Gloucester community! We're proud that Gloucester seafood stands out each year among the rest at SENA. I look forward to continuing to work with you to keep the tradition alive for years to come. https://t.co/RJ9SE1dk92Thanks for a great conversation, @jomalleydillon and @FrankBruni https://t.co/n9GCNwo1AkIt’s true https://t.co/v2d2hdy7mvSaddened to learn of the passing of my colleague Rep. Louise Slaughter. She was universally respected and sharp as a tack. We will truly miss her wisdom and experience.This will make it even more difficult for service members to access the fast track to American citizenship that was promised to them. 

We’re telling people that you can be an American soldier but not an American citizen. That’s not right.
https://t.co/Ove4XQHU1V#PA18 is just the beginning. This campaign has shown what Democrats can do when we’re willing to run everywhere. #November6th https://t.co/hwOi1URW8f.@ConorLambPA is exactly the type of leader we need in Washington, now more than ever. But he's not the only one. 

It’s time for the generation that fought in Iraq and Afghanistan to step in for the generation that sent us there. https://t.co/Vo2ceBsCySVeterans like @ConorLambPA are answering the call to serve all across the country – in districts that are even more competitive for Democrats than #PA18. Check out Josh in California #CA50 https://t.co/HbIOU2ZzqrI’m with you https://t.co/brdMcbrhXLDemocrats can win everywhere – even #PA18. The political establishment – on both sides – told @ConorLambPA he couldn’t win. But we CAN win the House and hold Trump accountable by coming together, challenging the status quo, and having a forward-looking message for the country.Congrats Congressman-elect @ConorLambPA! Through his service as a Marine, Conor's proven that he's exactly the kind public servant we need now more than ever in Washington. Clearly the activists who came out in full force know he'll be a strong representative for #PA18.Tonight we learned that Democrats can compete and win everywhere – and that every vote counts. I look forward to serving in Congress with Conor when all the votes are counted.On paper, @ConorLambPA shouldn't have stood a chance in this district that voted for Republicans by 20 points in the last election. This turnout is the result of the hard work of volunteers and activists. I saw that energy and excitement in #PA18 last weekend.Agree. #VoteLamb https://t.co/6vbM4IaGidYou’re rotten to the Corps, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/Db7k3Q1lJJGet to the polls, #PA18! Less than an hour left to make @ConorLambPA your next Congressman. Find your local polling station here https://t.co/OUHNdSLTZN and #VoteLamb https://t.co/Yco46BglCg"The other side" is literally a Marine veteran who put his life in the line for this country. One thing I've heard over and over: people are tired of this divisive rhetoric. #VoteLamb https://t.co/hsPNwvXne1Congratulations, @lauriestephens3! We're so proud of you back home in #MA6!

#GoTeamUSA 🇺🇸👏🥉 https://t.co/MKTagkVLUpMarines in my platoon hailed from inner-city Brooklyn, rural Alabama, and a gated community outside of Park City, Utah, but we put aside our political, religious, and other differences to do what was right for the country. 

We need leaders like @ConorLambPA who will do the same. https://t.co/PMbPpe7gPuYesterday, Republicans in Congress abandoned their duty to get to the bottom of Russia’s interference in our election.

Today, we can begin to hold them accountable. Get out the vote for @ConorLambPA – knock on doors, make calls, chip in. And don’t stop till #November6thThe point of diplomacy is to avoid chaos, not create it. Feels like @POTUS is shuffling the deck chairs on his sinking ship of an Administration. Not what we need as they go into negotiations with North Korea.Conor is a great guy, a true leader, a public servant. And the voters know it. @ConorLambPA #PA18 https://t.co/9hbEZcrDTLRepublicans won this district in the last election by 20 points.

Anything is possible when we come together to support outstanding public servants like Marine veteran @ConorLambPA. Election Day is tomorrow – let’s keep it up! #VoteLamb https://t.co/O332Peu2eiThere are many orgs that serve all veterans, but you're right, a lot are focused on vets of more recent conflict. If you or someone you know is in need of help, please contact @Dennis_Magnasco in my office. https://t.co/pXd0N3LsNpWhile @GOP passed tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, teachers have been living paycheck to paycheck. And they certainly don't have the tools to prepare young Americans for the future. 

Don't tell me that's the best America can do. #November6th https://t.co/rfeBGla76Z.@ConorLambPA has proven that he is exactly the kind of down-to-earth public servant we need now more than ever in Washington. The activists, union members, and volunteers who are out in full force know he’ll be a strong representative for #PA18. Two more days. Let's keep it up! https://t.co/6cccvM4XfMMassachusetts has strong laws to protect student borrowers from fraud and abuse for a reason. I am unfortunately not surprised that President Trump and Secretary DeVos want to put student loan servicers above the law and above my constituents. https://t.co/4jeKLQjlAQThat’s...not how facts or logic work... https://t.co/eOKregsIGiIt's not every day you get to save a life. Proud of the officers at @NorthReadingPD for reviving this pup! https://t.co/erJwvfJWCPWe cannot keep sitting by and watching this happen in our country - not to our kids, not to our nurses, not to anyone. https://t.co/2XE8e9nGWdCapicola! https://t.co/XRkYsvJ9WOPeople often ask me if there's anything to be hopeful about in politics right now. A new generation of leadership in Washington - that’s what gives me hope. @ConorLambPA is a Marine veteran and former federal prosecutor who will make a great Representative for #PA18. #VoteLamb! https://t.co/KFSTBO2nMlThere's incredible energy in #PA18 to get out the vote for @ConorLambPA. Americans are ready for service-driven leaders in Washington. https://t.co/vxjy3yFv9bHeard such good things about @primantibros that I got a second dinner. It did not disappoint. Fueling up to knock doors for @ConorLambPA tomorrow! #PA18 #VoteLamb https://t.co/Y1af9GhjsTCongratulations @BrendanCrighton on your inauguration to the state Senate! I look forward to continuing to work with you to help communities like Lynn achieve their full potential. #ma6 #mapoliThanks for stopping by @THE_PFFM. I'll do everything I can to make sure our firefighters have what they need to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/Q15uvJB2y8I’m glad that the VA has answered the call to hire a permanent director in Bedford. This is a step in the right direction, and I look forward to working with Joan to ensure that veterans receive what they deserve – the best health care in the world.

https://t.co/02Fl4N5qdWWe deserve a President who will stand up to assassins. 

Is that too much to ask? https://t.co/8Nyzwy2KTrDon't forget refusing to implement the sanctions against Russia that Congress passed with near unanimous bipartisan consent. https://t.co/ZcP2n1mmvCTrump's Administration is justifying continued US presence in Syria using the post-9/11 war authorization Congress passed in 2001.

I asked Bush, Obama, and now, @realDonaldTrump, I ask you: How does this end? 
https://t.co/iBXc5abnaPIt was one of the greatest honors of my life to get a tour of American history today from one of the heroes who helped make it. Thank you, @repjohnlewis. https://t.co/krhLi92nBvAfter we invaded Iraq, I was assigned to manage a TV station in Baghdad, because after decades of Saddam, we had to help the Iraqis open up the airwaves to information.

Back then we knew that an independent press was key to a free and open democracy. https://t.co/fTrmoWzXnLRussia wants you to know that they attempted to assassinate this former spy (and his daughter). The US must stand with our allies and condemn this behavior that should have ended with the Cold War. What will you do, @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/7biLaWtve7Thinking of my wife, my mom, my sister, and all the other important women in my life today. Happy International Women's Day! #IWD2018 #PressForProgessThe VA must select a new director of the New England health system without delay. We've seen the consequences of not having longterm, steady leadership at Bedford, and the risk here is greater because the VISN oversees several hospitals. Vets are waiting..@NRA logic: Americans need more guns to protect us from the guns they’ve already encouraged us to buy. 
https://t.co/t23KicZCsXCongratulations to @JosephKopser on answering the call to serve and moving one step closer to November in last night’s primary election in Texas!So much energy on the ground in Texas! Last year, we learned Democrats can win anywhere—even Alabama. But to do it we need to talk to voters everywhere. If you believe America deserves new leaders, there's never been a more important time to get involved: https://t.co/WMrwMjC8QH https://t.co/rpceVh8HeKLast night, a gay first-generation American who served in the USAF under Don't Ask, Don't Tell took one more step toward being elected to Congress – in Texas. America is ready for a new generation of leaders like @ginaortizjones who'll put people over politics. Congrats, Gina!Whether you believe in climate change or not, we're all going to pay for it if we don't adapt and innovate. It's not just a problem for the future – it's affecting us today.
https://t.co/60EVhD9HODToday, Texas held the first primaries of the midterm elections. 

The number of early voting ballots submitted for Democrats was up over 100% compared to the last midterm year.In Trump's first year, the GOP gave a $1T tax break to corporations, tried to take health care from millions, and failed to hold his administration accountable as it tore immigrants from their families. 

Democrats need to take back the House in November. And that starts tonight.Congratulations to @wutrain on being nominated by @emilyslist!  Vote here if you agree she's a Rising Star: https://t.co/yYdStOReRSThings change when we stand together. 

Thanks to the teachers of West Virginia for the reminder, and congratulations — this raise is long overdue. https://t.co/ZwLbtRnVeoThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas students are giving us all a lesson in courage and leadership. Our policies have failed them, so they're setting out to make our country better. That's exactly how we should be teaching our future generations to act. #ImWithTheKids https://t.co/PUYUlTqEC6We can tackle challenges like climate change – but only if we have leaders who will put fact over fiction. Leaders like @JosephKopser, an engineer running for Congress in Texas. Good luck in today's primary election, Joe!
https://t.co/BWukeMGXfKI stand with the teachers in West Virginia demanding fair wages. No surprise veterans @Ojeda4Congress and @aaronscheinberg are helping lead the fight.
https://t.co/oThYXRrAeATrump: "fine people" among the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville

Trump: *levies tariffs*
Paul Ryan: Now hold on... https://t.co/NHMZYrS9dqToday, March 5, is the arbitrary deadline @realDonaldTrump set for Congress to "act on #DACA," yet GOP leaders have done nothing. #Dreamers deserve a future here in their country—and the vast majority of fellow Americans agree.
