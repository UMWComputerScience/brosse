Today I rallied with hundreds of Virginians in Richmond to voice a simple message: #FamiliesBelongTogether.

The Trump administration needs to answer for why 2,000+ kids remain separated from their parents thanks to their cruel policy. https://t.co/ARafLl5dFQWe have massive inequities in our criminal justice system and we‚Äôve over-incarcerated too many Americans ‚Äì especially in communities of color ‚Äì for low-level drug offenses. We have to do something about that. This bill is a good place to start. https://t.co/DQltI5YKRpAn American newsroom should never feel "like a war zone." This is awful. My heart breaks for Virginia's neighbors in Maryland, as more senselessly die from another act of gun violence. Grateful for first responders' actions at the scene. https://t.co/g9xwUDF2DAThe Constitution is clear: With SCOTUS, both the President and Senate have roles in this process. 

The GOP was clear: In an election year, the people also get a voice in this process.

So the people need to choose their Senate in November before we give consent to any nominee.Thank you @GiffordsCourage for your support -- I am proud to stand with you in the fight against gun violence. Your advocacy and voice are critical to us finally taking action to prevent more senseless deaths. https://t.co/RfTOIP8CzkBig day - we unanimously (and finally) updated #PerkinsCTE. I've called for this action for years, and today's legislation, backed by Ds &amp; Rs, includes pieces of 3 of my bills to improve quality and access to career and tech education. Will help prepare students for good jobs! https://t.co/LPPwKxYZ7ADisappointed by SCOTUS. Trump's intentions were clear: stoke fear and perpetuate stereotypes. Discrimination based on religion or national origin doesn't make us safer; it undermines our values.

Congress must pass legislation to revoke this ban. https://t.co/7U21Q4gaqzMy opponent shares his views on an issue he is bizarrely obsessed with‚Äîsaying that the Civil War wasn‚Äôt about slavery! My campaign is about jobs, health care and education for today‚Äôs Virginians. Is it 1861 or 2018? https://t.co/CH0oKDlNvyThe Trump tariffs are killing U.S. jobs. A trade war with our closest allies continues to make no sense.

https://t.co/IeX2WSMvAaTrump's order leaves us with more questions than answers:

How to ensure kids are safely returned to parents?
When?
Where are they being held?
In what conditions?
What care are they getting?

We'll keep asking because, lord knows, we can't trust this administration on its face.Deeply troubled by this report. We need answers on what happened at this facility, and my staff and I are going to demand them. https://t.co/kqEFYQSPOtPresident Trump's "action" today did not end this administration's heartlessness when it comes to families at the border. 

If they're not going to lift a finger to reunite these kids with their parents, then we -- all of us -- will stay outraged until they do. https://t.co/rVdHKazeH0My thoughts on the situation at the border...

I've been to neighborhoods where gangs prey on children and seen parents' anguish. To them, their kids' lives are worth the dangerous trek to America, where they seek peace.

Now, they're ending up in cages.

https://t.co/XWr41PsltWThe Old Testament instructs the faithful: ‚ÄúWhen a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them... Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners.‚Äù A lesson for us all on this #WorldRefugeeDay.

How we treat those fleeing violence and poverty shows our values.What we‚Äôre seeing at the border is cruel and goes against our values.

If you‚Äôre looking for a way to stop it, consider giving to one of the groups doing important work right now to help kids and families on the border.

Retweet to spread the word.

https://t.co/BtRVaqjHx8Today in 1865 our nation took a tremendous step towards becoming a more perfect union.

Church this AM with Anne, my Marine son Nat coming home to Richmond for lunch, calling my Dad, my other 2 kids Woody and Annella checking in long distance, then finishing with @U2 in DC on Songs of Innocence and Experience Tour. I love U2 and William Blake! https://t.co/TL0oqTRTvAOn this #FathersDay, put your dad in your mind‚Äôs eye. Or your son or daughter.

Now imagine them being ripped away from you.

Families seeking refuge in America‚Äîright now‚Äîare being torn apart by this administration. Is this who we are?

#KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/Qb182dVldfMy week: Trump tweets that I am a ‚Äútotal stiff.‚Äù But he called Kim Jong Un a ‚Äúvery talented man.‚Äù I‚Äôll take it! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHappy (almost) Father's Day to all the dads and dad jokers out there.

https://t.co/P44ZM3fEJRFor those wanting to know about my Senate opponent, take a look at his latest bit of wisdom. 

An empty bucket rattles the loudest. I‚Äôll skip the teeth-kicking and keep serving Virginians. https://t.co/AyxZwxWXruWell, I have an opponent.

He has stoked the fires of bigotry in Virginia.
He's underfunded public schools and health care.
He vows to run a "vicious" campaign against me.

That's not what we need. It's not who we are.

Take a stand with me: https://t.co/Zg5LfuUiRf@GCV_ArtDirector Looks cheesy!Help!!

Equality has always been America‚Äôs North Star. We‚Äôve fallen short in our pursuit of it at times. But together let‚Äôs keep chasing it. Happy #Pride https://t.co/C2jV6SrHdHLetting Russia into the G-7 would be like inviting Gallagher to join you at the farmer‚Äôs market. https://t.co/BVeMrMsBr3Are the Caps the best team in the NHL?

https://t.co/xDluIRNAz0I've long said we should eliminate superdelegates ‚Äì so ahead of a big DNC meeting Friday, I'm glad to see support gathering (including from @TomPerez) for this proposal that makes our nominating process more fair and democratic.

https://t.co/f3Fkb9Pju1So many Virginians will now get access to health care.

(Is that how this #ALLCAPS thing works?)Virginia voters showed up big time in 2017 and now we are able to expand Medicaid to 400,000 more people. Good turnout in 2018 can lead to similar gains in jobs, health care and education. We've shown we can resist - now let's also show we can ADVANCE!

https://t.co/nFQX48fM35Upwards of 400,000 Virginians will have access to health care after this momentous week in Virginia.

Now, we can finally expand coverage to hundreds of thousands of Virginians who need it. https://t.co/LkLlKSl4a8BIG NEWS: The Virginia Senate just voted to move forward on Medicaid expansion!

The bipartisan passage of the #FY19NDAA in the Armed Services Committee, on which I sit, exemplifies how we can work together to make our country stronger and move us forward.Thank you, @MineWorkers!

That's disturbing.Among the many casualties of the war on terror was the moral judgment of those in government complicit in the use of torture. Gina Haspel was one of them. Like @SenJohnMcCain, I am gravely concerned by her failure to condemn torture as immoral. I will be opposing her nomination."There are a variety of factors feeding the rising costs...

Democrats and Republicans know that Mueller should be allowed to finish his investigation without obstruction. https://t.co/aWliBLikKmInstead of sabotaging our health care system because you couldn‚Äôt pass repeal, if you want to help Americans get more choices for lower costs, why not start with passing a real public option to give everyone access to an insurance plan? Seems like a no-brainer. https://t.co/KBCB52YjnfHappy 50th birthday to the #FairHousingAct. As a civil rights attorney, I know the FHA is every bit as important now as it was the day it passed in 1968.15 months in, and the Trump administration has no Syria strategy. Threats, tweets, one off strikes are not a strategy. Baiting Russia is not a strategy. This is why Congress needs to reassert control over war powers. https://t.co/5ejChDI0ioWe need to pass legislation to #ProtectMueller right away. https://t.co/to0KBaeEcJAssad should face consequences for his atrocities, but Trump is a president, not a king - he needs to come to Congress if he wants to initiate military action. If he strikes Syria without our approval, what‚Äôs to stop him from bombing North Korea or Iran? https://t.co/Z4EFgiRAe6So we‚Äôre asking thousands of troops to leave home and deploy to the border so they can ... clear brush? https://t.co/NLz25VOvivPresident Trump won‚Äôt call out Russia for attacking the U.S. election but calls a warranted search of his lawyer‚Äôs office an ‚Äúattack on our country.‚Äù What country is he referring to? https://t.co/E24rK8BR4IIt's long past time for Scott Pruitt to go. I opposed his nomination because I knew he'd gut environmental protections from the very agency tasked with executing them. But his ethical lapses and misuse of taxpayer resources are the last straw. Americans deserve better.How do you close out a 23-city, 6-day, nonstop campaign launch?

#NationalBeerDay https://t.co/ZqY5sAD5WzWow what a way to start Day 6 of our campaign kickoff tour across Virginia - 425+ Northern Virginians at a rally in Alexandria. I‚Äôm so humbled to see all these friends come out in support of my vision of a Virginia For All! https://t.co/r2ZkfbM3Y6Need a hip or knee replacement? What about birth control or a vaccine? How about a filling for a cavity? If so, Trump‚Äôs tariffs may jack up prices for each. We‚Äôre only just beginning to see how far-reaching the harmful consequences of this policy are. https://t.co/NgtuAgnomoDay 5 of my campaign kickoff in the books - from Loudoun to Fairfax, Prince William, and the Northern Neck. Virginia has grown because we‚Äôve embraced the future: education, infrastructure, immigration, inclusion, innovation. We could use more of all that these days. https://t.co/BqcQQi0nkoJust toured IKEA‚Äôs Danville manufacturing plant. Asked if the tariffs worry them. They‚Äôre ok for now, but because they import a lot of raw materials, they‚Äôre concerned about what‚Äôs to come. We have to stop this rash policy before it hurts even more U.S. businesses and workers. https://t.co/f5fNO67ky1Who‚Äôs gonna get slammed by the Trump tariffs? Virginia farmers! Agriculture is our largest private industry: we produce some of the best soybeans, pork, apples and wine and sell them across the world. Our economy and so many jobs at risk because of this. https://t.co/LruwxzxpIl‚ÄúPeople living with disabilities, serious illness, and the frailty of old age are bracing to lose caregivers‚Äù due to Trump‚Äôs harsh anti-immigrant agenda. Yet another way this administration is ripping apart families and communities. https://t.co/O5JiNCr2zEBack home in Richmond to hit the hay but we closed out our 16-hour day really strong: with a rally in my wife Anne‚Äôs native Roanoke. I laid out my vision for a Virginia that works for all, with no region left out or behind.

Next up: Southside &amp; Lynchburg! https://t.co/sZuqLsHBQ0 https://t.co/uafFpjFtZFWe can improve health care in Southwest Virginia by:

3Ô∏è‚É£ Making VA addiction-free by 2030

Talking with health care experts in Abingdon as my campaign launch rolls on. https://t.co/cyuwYjCtpaI was only 10, but I vividly remember the day we lost Martin Luther King Jr and the heartbreak we felt as a nation. 50 years later, his teachings still endure: We must care for the 'least of these,' there is no justice without equality, and love is greater than hate. #MLK50First it was a military parade to entertain himself, now it‚Äôs deploying troops to the border to intimidate immigrants? This is a Commander in Chief whose first impulse always seems to be to use the military as his own personal political prop. https://t.co/5LZ0MJ1COyI'm on the road this morning, heading southwest to start Day 3 of our tour with breakfast in Big Stone Gap - and I might even be headed to your town next!

For a decade! So don't let the gun lobby cry "unconstitutional!" It wasn't.

We are pushing to *reinstate* this law so we can reduce mass shootings. Pretty straightforward.Wow, 75% of Americans support a public option (like my Medicare X plan), including 74% of Independents and 64% of Republicans.

Naomi: you also represent the best of Virginia and of America.

#MarchForOurLives https://t.co/ep4ZbRuZ05I was Governor when it happened, and as strange a thing it is to say about your own state, I hoped it would be the worst mass shooting America would ever have. Sadly, every ‚Äúworst shooting‚Äù has happened since. #Enough https://t.co/mGOTtBDLfDThis is who I march for.

For our littlest kids.

The ones who have not yet stepped foot into a classroom. They deserve to grow up in an America where school shootings just don‚Äôt happen.

#MarchForOurLives https://t.co/Q9bBMKEj5nGood morning from Richmond‚Äôs #MarchForOurLives

I march for the 32 lives lost in 2007 at Virginia Tech - and the kids we‚Äôve lost to gun violence every day since. Enough. 

Who do you march for? https://t.co/EyiRKf06ITMy kid's a Marine.

My state has the closest ties to the military in the country, between active duty and veterans.

Give me a break. We care. We are the ones pushing a long-term defense spending plan. This is so beneath the office, but I guess not beneath Donald Trump. https://t.co/3b4qnIgcjLGoing live on MSNBC now with @mitchellreports to talk about "the Art of the Deal-Wrecker" (what we saw from President Trump this AM) -- tune in!@HerskowitzSuzan Thanks! You too - hope you get in some reading time.Seriously though, Rip Van Winkle, did you just awake from a long slumber? We gave you a deal last month that offered all the border funding you wanted AND a path to citizenship for Dreamers. YOU (or your minions) tanked it and turned us down. Art of the Deal-Wrecker! https://t.co/lCMndiITf8I‚Äôve truly lost track of how many times now President Trump has threatened or cheerled a government shutdown. https://t.co/lCMndiITf8America should be grateful to General McMaster. After a long military career, he accepted the NSA job to protect the country and speak truth to power. And he was sadly pushed out for doing just that.Just 22 days ago, John Bolton wrote a @WSJ op-ed: ‚ÄúThe Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.‚Äù ‚ÄúEliminate‚Äù them, he said.

#AustinBombingsSure, Trump staff wrote ‚ÄúDO NOT CONGRATULATE‚Äù on Putin call briefing, but they forgot to scrawl ‚ÄúI HEAR YOU‚Äù onto the pre-briefing notecard. So here we are. https://t.co/OByKf55nvN#6MonthsAfterMaria, tens of thousands in Puerto Rico remain without power. Millions of our fellow Americans there are suffering or struggling to rebuild.

Congrats @RadfordMBB on your first-ever NCAA tournament win.

Sorry, Nova, but spoiler alert: David beats Goliath.Secretaries of State should always seek diplomacy over war, but as a member of Congress, here's how Mike Pompeo talked about Iran: "It is under 2,000 sorties to destroy the Iranian nuclear capacity. This is not an insurmountable task for the coalition forces." Dangerous!Why would President Trump fire his Secretary of State at such a grave moment? He's about to meet with North Korea, the Russian threat continues to pervade the globe, and key ambassadorships go empty. Chaos at the top may make for good reality TV but it's dangerous foreign policy.Ten rounds.

That's the magazine limit allowed in Kentucky while hunting deer.

Yet when we call for similar limits on assault weapons used in mass shootings, we're told it violates the 2nd Amendment.

Why are we valuing deer lives more than human life?12 days ago, President Trump said that, when it comes to legislation on gun violence, we should ‚Äúcome down on the strong side.‚Äù

His plan today doesn‚Äôt support a universal background checks bill, or raise age limits, or ban assault weapons.

Sounds like the weak side to me.Stunning ignorance about our public schools from the Cabinet secretary in charge of them. https://t.co/qEEKYRZROwPutin suggests Jews are to blame for Russian election interference. Why does our President still cover for this anti-Semitic dictator?

Our bipartisan plan to protect Dreamers from deportation got *15* more votes than the Trump plan. This was a sensible plan to solve the problem. President Trump chose to tank it to push a much more cruel and restrictive plan‚Äîand it failed. Bigly.Despite President Trump‚Äôs actions, I refuse to give up on protecting Dreamers from deportation. La lucha sigue ‚Äî the fight continues.President Trump created a crisis when he unilaterally ended DACA. He asked Congress to clean up his mess, so we did‚Äîwith a bipartisan plan to protect Dreamers and fund border security. But Trump refused to take yes for an answer and tanked the deal.The past few weeks, we‚Äôve tried every approach to getting permanent protection for Dreamers. It‚Äôs been my primary focus in the immigration negotiations. I firmly believe the bipartisan deal today is our best chance to pass a bill to shield them from deportation.You can read more about our plan here: https://t.co/PdkT5TRP3nBREAKING: After weeks of working together to find a solution, tonight we are announcing a bipartisan plan to permanently protect Dreamers from deportation. This is our best chance to get this important work done, and I hope my colleagues join me in supporting it.April 16, 2007, was the worst day of my life‚Äîwhen 32 people were shot and killed at Virginia Tech.

That's why we introduced the Community College to Career Fund Act today. It helps businesses connect with community colleges, so fewer jobs go unfilled, while making skills training and education more affordable.The Senate must pass this budget deal in short order, then we will immediately move to immigration legislation. I will continue pushing for a bill that permanently protects Dreamers and does not needlessly restrict legal immigration to rip families apart. That would be a mistake.Virginia and our nation will benefit from today's long-term budget deal, which forges bipartisan agreement on key priorities like supporting the military, investing in infrastructure and veterans hospitals, providing disaster relief, and fighting drug addiction.@SenAngusKing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWhy is President Trump *constantly* rooting for a government shutdown?

Look, if you don‚Äôt wanna work, just take some extra ‚Äúexecutive time‚Äù ‚Äî don‚Äôt threaten the economy or thousands of federal workers. OK? https://t.co/VhW5NigJYT@MoscatoNights Thank you and your family for your service!@kathyf That story should never be told by a spouse who wants to work. Never. I hope our efforts can help begin to change this for countless military families.@y_stenger I'm grateful for his service‚Äîand yours. Being a military family member isn't easy.@soldiershomenow @MarkWarner Hey Robert, Mark and I actually are both cosponsors of Senator Markey's resolution. We need strong #NetNeutrality protections to keep the internet free and open.@AhmedMasud Sure! You can find it here: https://t.co/auhHgNT8Ln.Today I introduced a bill to reduce military spouse unemployment, which is at least 3x the national average.

My bill takes a holistic approach to the problem, addressing:

‚òëÔ∏è Child care
‚òëÔ∏è Education and training
‚òëÔ∏è Transition assistance
‚òëÔ∏è Hiring
‚òëÔ∏è EntrepreneurshipWe're LIVE on Facebook, taking your questions. Tune in and ask away! https://t.co/Fqt5hDrvNDI clapped in his general direction. https://t.co/XitbntSRo2Tonight at 8pm, I'll be taking questions live on Facebook over at https://t.co/zWzs0wDUMX. If you can't make it live, feel free to reply and tweet your questions at me now. I'll answer some of them during the stream! https://t.co/sAvR75ohJi25 years ago today, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) became law. To this day, it remains the only real federal reform to workplace leave for new parents, illness, or caring for a relative. That's not okay. We have to do more to make work work for modern families. #FMLA25@Viesta99 @jtimberlake My staff would be very amused by your charitable description - "fashion conscious." I do love a good denim jacket though!A lot of folks are criticizing @jtimberlake‚Äôs halftime outfit, and I agree... It definitely needed a jean jacket. #SuperBowlAt @rvasymphony for Remembering 1968: A Tribute to MLK. Powerful works, including Beethoven‚Äôs Choral Fantasy and Scenes from the Life of a Martyr by local legend Undine Smith Moore. Also a reminder of all the work that remains to pursue equality! https://t.co/Hj3TU4dXWOLaw enforcement opposes this.

The intelligence community opposes this.

Even many Republicans oppose this.

This is dangerous territory, it disrespects law enforcement, and it's an alarming partisan attack on efforts to investigate hostile foreign interference in our democracy. https://t.co/kMVVhUQ35I@robpix220 I'm glad you bring that up, Rob. I helped secure a pay raise for our troops in the 2018 defense bill, which thankfully did pass in Congress and President Trump signed. We have to take a holistic approach to better serving our military members and their families.@crs2fer4 I‚Äôve been proud to work on properly funding our military, and we passed a good 2018 defense bill last year that President Trump has signed.@America79489795 It‚Äôs not an ‚Äúeither/or.‚Äù I was proud to help secure a pay raise for military servicemembers in the in the 2018 defense bill, which we passed and President Trump signed in December.@vicsm1 I agree, Vickie. We have to tackle high child care costs, for military families as well as all parents. I‚Äôve been working on this issue in the Senate and will definitely keep it up.@annaliese32309 Thank you and your husband for your service. We‚Äôve absolutely got to make it easier for vets and military spouses to find good civilian jobs when they want them.It seems shocking, but somewhere between 12-25% of military spouses are unemployed‚Äîa fact that causes countless military families serious financial insecurity. We can't ignore this problem. That's why today I'm announcing legislation to help reduce military spouse unemployment.These dogs have had a ruff year‚Äîmany are from areas hit hard by natural disasters, from Houston to Puerto Rico. So I‚Äôm glad to see #PuppyBowl showcasing adoptable rescues! I hear the Wide Retriever is the favorite for MVP, but mark my words: the Quarterbark is a sleeper pick. https://t.co/eqW4WasV4CI‚Äôm so proud of my former staffer @allycollsteele. She helped me get elected to the Senate, now I‚Äôm urging us all to help her and @campaign_purple as they work to end the systemic problem of workplace harassment. Ally is a leader to watch! https://t.co/OKDLhtn8hRTrump‚Äôs on a tweet rampage against FBI/DOJ for being too helpful to Dems. But there‚Äôs a problem with that theory:

Comey? Republican.
Wray? Republican.
Mueller? Republican.
Sessions? Republican.
Rosenstein? Republican.

I guess, to him, upholding the Constitution is pro-Democrat.@JPatrickCronin That‚Äôs right, Patrick. Thank you for coming out tonight. We‚Äôll have to keep fighting to protect Dreamers and immigrant families, as well as for a long-term spending plan that gives our military certainty.@LisaKubiske Thank you for your service!We are in a sad state when the last senior career diplomat at the State Department calls it quits. This is a grave loss for our country, and the Trump administration's consistent assault on diplomacy will have long-lasting negative ramifications for our national security. https://t.co/ay4HQOHYPWHappy birthday to my good-timing, smart, beautiful wife and partner of going-on 35 years, Anne. A juvenile court judge and longtime public education advocate, she's the best public servant in our family. What a journey we've had‚Äîand continue to have‚Äîtogether. I love you. https://t.co/Uqgpy516eRHad a great conversation today with Korean-American community leaders in Annandale. Concerns ranged from tensions on the Korean peninsula to how we can protect immigrant families from being divided. These voices animate my work in the Senate‚Äîwork that‚Äôs as important as ever. https://t.co/aQASJcVIrNI want to thank the Republican congressmen‚Äîseveral of whom are doctors‚Äîand senators, including my friends @JeffFlake and @BillCassidy, who as I understand it helped tend to the wounded and assist first responders at today‚Äôs chaotic crash scene in Virginia. Goodness on display.That was a good day, made even brighter by the Queen‚Äôs awesome hat. Thanks for the memory! https://t.co/SKCK0ukBiI@TheCelieHolmes ‚ÄúMake America Decent Again‚Äù - I love that, what a great message. I may steal it from you!@CarlosV64910815 I really appreciate that, Carlos. We‚Äôve got to keep standing up for our values.Visiting with Vietnamese-Americans in Falls Church, I‚Äôm reminded‚Äîyet again‚Äîof just how much we are strengthened when immigrant families are welcome to enrich our communities. Harsh crackdowns on family migration would divide and erode the fabric of our society and economy. https://t.co/pyyBmJNRBJPraying for everyone involved in the accident in Crozet. Thankful for the first responders and those on the scene helping the injured. https://t.co/ExJ3HmZVYGIf President Trump is serious about finally getting things done, I have an idea of where he could start:
Step 1. Stop using offensive rhetoric to tout a plan that would divide families.
Step 2. Start supporting the bipartisan work we‚Äôre doing in the Senate to protect Dreamers.It is outrageous that, after one year, there's still no Ambassador in South Korea. As we head into the #SOTU, the Trump administration's folly of undercutting diplomacy is yet again on full display. https://t.co/spzHoQXVal@lavawitch I‚Äôm just so happy for the tribes that we got this done! Total team effort.We've learned by now that President Trump will say anything. So when it comes to tonight's #SOTU, what matters isn't what he says or whether he seems "presidential" ‚Äî it's what he does when the speech is over. Let's hold him accountable for that.Kimberly-Clark, the major corporation that makes Kleenex, will fire thousands of workers and close 10 factories, and you know how they're planning to pay for it?

With their Trump tax cut.
