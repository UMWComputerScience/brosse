#InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/89NgtAxjBsCalifornia's lawmakers are intentionally obstructing federal law and are putting the interests of dangerous illegal immigrants ahead of Americans. We need to secure our borders and eliminate sanctuary cities.By providing protection to illegal immigrants and disregarding federal law, the state of California is jeopardizing American lives. This is unacceptable and sanctuary cities should be penalized for their actions.I applaud the Dept. of Justice for taking action and cracking down on California's liberal immigration policies that provide safe havens for illegal immigrants. https://t.co/7VntHuizge #FoxNewsPalazzo introduces CENOTE Bill: Unmanned Maritime Systems Benefit From New Legislation - https://t.co/HTID29JR4Aüì∑üì∑üì∑

It‚Äôs time for Senate Democrats to decide if they want to put millions of children‚Äôs health insurance at risk.
