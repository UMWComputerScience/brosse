Powerful panel yesterday with #GA10 native Heidi Floyd, @CWforA’s @jaimeballew, and @AUL's Evangeline Bartz.

Thank you for your personal stories and thoughtful insight. https://t.co/G5qKkag5mvToday the House – through regular order – passed a strong defense appropriations bill that supports investments to ensure maximum readiness &amp; warfighting capability for our troops. It's a step forward as we work to tackle challenges around the world.

Stop by 1334 Longworth House Office Building at 1 p.m. to hear the empowering story of Heidi Floyd, a #GA10 native who battled cancer during her pregnancy. Come learn about resources for support and decision-making from a panel of experts. https://t.co/dsDVIikkiPThe oversight is necessary to make sure corruption is not taking place, and we have the right constitutionally to ensure to the American people that corruption is not involved in this whole investigation. No American citizen should have the scales stacked against them. #IGReport https://t.co/LAneOxCOYxFrom the Rotunda to the Crypt to the old Senate Chamber, the @USCapitol is absolutely awe-inspiring. Reserving tours of D.C. attractions is just another service my office happily offers to #GA10 constituents. More about setting up a memorable trip here→https://t.co/PGANb3pqii. https://t.co/0eahfvcFz7Through the #IGReport, Americans discovered text after text &amp; email after email demonstrating in no uncertain terms that FBI agents working on the Clinton case leading up to the 2016 election were clearly biased against @realDonaldTrump. I’ve joined the call to reveal the agents. https://t.co/r3h5xgur6yI'd like to invite folks to come hear the inspiring story of Heidi Floyd's battle with cancer during her pregnancy on Wednesday from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. Join us in 1334 LHOB for an educational briefing with resources for support and decision-making during pregnancy. #ProLife https://t.co/r9AAxRG3ulNo ruff days in the office with this furry friend! #TakeYourDogToWorkDay #FreyaOnTheHill https://t.co/1VRjQwotyPI'm always grateful for #TeamHice.

More→ https://t.co/8hAZMhB7U4 https://t.co/XL8FqQpitdThe conservative principles embodied in the Securing America's Future Act are the right solution &amp; should be the foundation of any future immigration bill. The 193 votes in support of it today prove that we’re close and, with a few tweaks, we could get it across the finish line.For decades, America has felt the repercussions of a failed, outdated immigration system that has rewarded those who enter this country illegally. While I am disappointed that the Securing America’s Future Act narrowly failed, I will continue to work with my colleagues.Enjoyed meeting with representatives from the @AmericanLegion last night as we celebrated #NationalGIBillWeek in Washington. Our veterans represent the very best of America, and while we can never repay them for their service and sacrifice, we must honor them as best we can. https://t.co/L4QvX4UvfKFor 74 years, the #GIBill has empowered our student-veterans who are seeking to advance their education. Proud my bill, the Protecting Veterans’ Educational Choice Act, helped pave the way for additional resources for our heroes. Thank you for your service. #NationalGIBillWeek https://t.co/ki1596tN8zSix months in &amp; it’s clear that #TaxReform is working. More jobs, fairer taxes, &amp; a thriving economy.

Learn more about how #TaxReformWorks and affects #GA10 at https://t.co/P84M3J4Zeh. #TaxCutsandJobsAct https://t.co/PB6YU2BA29Here's the elephant in the room: Every appearance &amp; action by Peter Strzok indicate that his political bias did, in fact, prevent him from bringing forth critical information during these investigations. Why? Because of its potential to harm the Clinton campaign. #IGReportHearing https://t.co/mKay3FkI3tUP NOW: Questioning Inspector General Horowitz on the #IGReport detailing the handling of the Clinton email investigation. From the delays in presenting Anthony Weiner's laptop to the clear bias displayed in the Strzok/Page text messages, there's more questions to be answered. https://t.co/yxhiaOKsrnCongress has a duty to investigate, and the need to investigate is based on holding people accountable. It’s time to expose bad apples, and I’m glad to join @RepAndyBiggsAZ, @RepMattGaetz, @Jim_Jordan, &amp; other Members of Congress in calling for transparency at the FBI. #IGReport https://t.co/mLWHhxcQHFExperiencing historic battlegrounds is incredibly moving &amp; underscores the importance of preserving America’s most sacred sites.

Before he passed, I was humbled to honor his life, legacy, and tireless work on behalf of the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces on the @HouseFloor. https://t.co/0PRQXoYfwj“There are so many awesome organizations that are doing a great job changing people’s lives by allowing them to get their feet underneath them,” Hice said. “Seeing what is going on here at the Home of Hope and playing bingo with the kids was a highlight of the day by far.” https://t.co/6KBuc0hVrQRemarkable morning at @HomeofHopeGCS with #TeamHice and members of @RepRobWoodall’s staff.

Check out its many successes ⬇️ @gdecd #GA10 #gapol https://t.co/E3HvxfO1n4President Reagan has always been an inspiration to me and millions of Americans. On his 107th Birthday, join me in honoring the life and legacy of a true statesman and principled conservative. He is missed more and more each day. Happy Birthday, Mr. President! https://t.co/HucRWBOlGgI'm pleased that #PAMA has been featured as @FreedomWorks’ Bill of the Month. History shows that former presidents often make millions after completing their term as Commander in Chief, rendering their pensions a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars.

I'm pleased to announce that @NEHgov will present a Regional Application-Writing Workshop on February 28th from 8:30 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. at the @universityofga Center for Continuing Education in #GA10. More info here→ https://t.co/1X6WmS6JgMGreat meeting with such an impressive group of young #GA10 students who were visiting Washington last week with the @CloseUp_DC program.

Are you one of the millions of Americans who received a bonus or increased pay as a result of this historic measure? Did you #CheckYourCheck and see a difference? Let me know here→ https://t.co/PMJ1FISvTr https://t.co/S7KtTCuF6yHappy 241st birthday to one of #Georgia’s first counties and a #GA10 favorite – Wilkes County! On this day in 1777, Georgia’s first Constitution was adopted and created eight counties. #gapol https://t.co/Bsb3ijIPEeAs an American citizen, I have “grave concerns” about what bad apples at the FBI and DOJ have done, and the fact that this could happen to anyone is intolerable. We need to be transparent and people of America need to see #TheMemo→ https://t.co/F6ncCaetFN #MemoDay https://t.co/orYAQqBq1vDirectly connecting Georgia families with the help and resources they need is one of my top priorities. If you need assistance with any federal agency, I encourage #GA10 to stop by one of #TeamHice's February Mobile Office Hours. Info below! https://t.co/5j8rAKwsqTI am okay following the train collision. Grateful for the swift action by my colleagues and first responders as they work to assist the injured. Please continue to pray for everyone involved.In @realDonaldTrump's remarkable #SOTU speech, he demonstrated that he's listening to the American people, &amp; he set an important tone in which he emphasized national security, economic opportunity, &amp; rebuilding America. Hats off to you, @POTUS! #MAGA More→https://t.co/oxSFQcZkIb https://t.co/SfcuglUg91LIVE NOW: Recapping the #SOTU and @POTUS’s powerful speech with @TimBryantRadio on @WGAUradio. Tune in - https://t.co/lJrBFWETfl https://t.co/fQQiOtWCFSUnder the Trump Administration, we're working to restore our Nation's military readiness and warfighting capabilities. After years of consistent neglect, I'm proud to have an ally in the White House who recognizes the importance of a well-funded Armed Services. #SOTU @POTUSSince @realDonaldTrump has taken office, ISIS has lost the vast majority of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria – just another way that this administration has demonstrated its commitment to strengthening global and national security. #SOTUIn an era of unprecedented threats, ensuring the safety and security of the American people is and should be our first priority. Thank you for your leadership, @realDonaldTrump. #SOTUThe Diversity Visa Lottery has already caused too many crimes, including the tragic attack in New York in November. It's time to put an end to this dangerous program and focus instead on bringing people who will contribute to our Nation. #SOTU #ImmigrationReformWith @POTUS Trump's leadership, we will revamp our legal immigration system to a merit-based system that prioritizes those who  bring much-needed skills to our country. #SOTUOur immigration system has laid stagnant for too long, to the detriment of the safety of our communities. With @POTUS's help, I look forward to limiting #ChainMigration, strengthening border security, and ending the visa lottery program. #SOTUSince the beginning of this Congress, House and Senate Republicans have rolled back dozens of burdensome, Obama-era regulations that have stifled growth and hiked up costs. In fact, in 2017 alone, more than 600 regulations were withdrawn! It's time to unleash American innovation!Veterans represent the very best of our Nation – and deserve the very best we have to offer them. It’s time to put those words into action and ensure that every single servicemember receives treatment we would all be proud of when they return home. #SOTU"In God We Trust," said @realDonaldTrump. AMEN! #SOTUDid you know that small businesses create roughly half of all jobs in the U.S.? That's why the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is lowering their tax rates - which previously could reach as high as 44%! Through #TaxReform, Congress is putting more money back in your pocket! #SOTUIn the the wake of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, $3 billion in bonuses have been doled out by corporations across the country, including #Georgia-based businesses like @SunTrust, @Aflac, and @HomeDepot! Looking forward to continued growth under @POTUS Donald Trump. #SOTUDid you know that the unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in decades? This administration is harnessing the powerful impact of #TaxReform, and people are already feeling its effects. #SOTU.@POTUS is about to start his first #SOTU. Tune in live here→ https://t.co/it2hZhrsCgLIVE NOW with @GetAustinRhodes to discuss the defense appropriations, preview the #SOTU, and talk about how we should #ReleaseTheMemo. https://t.co/TtWfWyyEtNAhead of the #SOTU, the American people must have full confidence in our government to fulfill its most fundamental responsibility to keep our citizens safe, and I am proud to have voted – again – to support our men and women in uniform with the passage of DOD Appropriations. https://t.co/VbDaZLe6H9Grateful to have @THEHermanCain join me this afternoon as we preview @POTUS’ first State of the Union address.

I look forward to ensuring that our warfighters have the tools and support necessary to protect and defend our homeland. #GA10 https://t.co/o939Wx7D7HThe inaction by the Senate continues to grow worse, &amp; I'm disappointed beyond words. Why? Because life is at stake. All of us—no matter the party—should agree that we have a vested interest in protecting young lives—including unborn children after 20 weeks. #TheyFeelPain #prolife https://t.co/kfqSnldCQTATTN #GA10: It’s not too late to get a flu shot! There have already been 25 deaths and more than 300 hospitalizations due to the flu in #Georgia alone.

I outlined some of my #GA10 priorities in an op-ed featured in the @AUG_Chronicle here→ https://t.co/DbJOJpg4ALToday, we pause and stand in solidarity with members of the Jewish community and their allies as the world commemorates the lives lost, heroism, and resolve displayed by those during the Holocaust. #WeRemember #HolocaustRemembranceDay https://t.co/BeQOe2Y1XgUnder the leadership of the incredibly savvy Head Coach @KirbySmartUGA and with a special group of young men, the #Dawgs had one of their greatest seasons in years. Last week, I honored @FootballUGA for its remarkable season and bright future on the @HouseFloor.  #GoDawgs https://t.co/yWBSatSJZR#SchoolChoice is all about empowering parents to make the best choices for their children. I’m happy to support @schoolchoicewk and #GA10 children by putting families back in the driver's seat when it comes to selecting the education that best fits their children. #gapol https://t.co/liZnKn1KfeThis is the time when I hope we'll come together and get our military fully funded for the rest of the year and keep it from being a political pinball ever again. Rather than tying in unrelated issues when it comes to government funding, let's keep the main thing the main thing. https://t.co/AKh5WUqLGTOutstanding "Coffee with Your Congressman" event in Henry County yesterday. I always love being home, and these forums encourage a meaningful and productive dialogue. I value your thoughts, and I'm looking forward to my next one! #GA10 https://t.co/OQR3GW4r3hThanks to all #GA10 residents who joined in on last Thursday’s productive Telephone Town Hall! These regular calls are a great way for me to give you updates, answer your questions, and listen to your concerns. Check out the results of the polls below! https://t.co/bO6js8L5ipEnjoyed joining @13wmaznews &amp; @WGXAnews this morning to discuss the reopening of government operations following the #SchumerShutdown, what I hope @POTUS will say during the #SOTU2018, &amp; how my placement to the @HASCRepublicans affects #GA10! Watch tonight's coverage for more. https://t.co/ivC3KmH4iGGrateful for the opportunity to not only hear from the new Secretary of the Army, but also to engage with the senior Army leadership on the issues facing our men and women in uniform and their families today. Thank you to all of our servicemembers who #HoldTheLine. https://t.co/wJooS9w3blHappy to have the chance to engage with folks from #GA10 about the issues that matter to you at my “Coffee with Your Congressman” event. If you're in Henry County or the surrounding area, I hope you'll join me today at the Henry County Chamber of Commerce from 12:30 pm - 1:30 pm. https://t.co/4xsQqqdbnoStarting the day on @MorningBriefing with Tim Farley to discuss the end of the #SchumerShutdown and the return to government operations. Listen in live here on SiriusXM - channel 124: https://t.co/LzY21WyBwePleased that @SenateDems finally dropped their needless blockade. Given their obstructionist record so far this Congress, I'm grateful that it didn’t take them even longer. Read more of my thoughts on the #SchumerShutdown in my weekly e-newsletter here→ https://t.co/FyazHLiiUy https://t.co/XKAq0SRnuIIf our servicemembers aren’t getting paid, then neither am I. Today, I informed the Chief Administrative Office that I’ll have my pay withheld until a funding bill is passed &amp; gets our men &amp; women in uniform their hard-earned pay. It’s your move, @SenSchumer. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/2dVtdf6gqkThe #SchumerShutdown is yet another Democrat plan in the obstructionist playbook. It’s shameful that @SenSchumer and Senate Democrats have prioritized amnesty over supporting our brave men and women in uniform and funding health care for the youngest among us through #CHIP. https://t.co/gDNj1zvWG8Our military leadership is being forced to ask our troops and their families to make yet another sacrifice as a result of the #SchumerShutdown. We should be making sacrifices for them– not asking them to make sacrifices for the sake of amnesty. https://t.co/Oe6VFlbw3MEarlier this morning, I examined the classified, four-page memo from @HouseIntelComm regarding the FBI, DOJ, and the so-called #RussianCollusion. To put it simply, “WOW.” I joined the call to #ReleaseTheMemo. Americans deserve truth and transparency. https://t.co/r2RJnLNaULA bet’s a bet, but I don’t have to be happy about it. It was a truly great game, and I’d like to thank my colleague @RepTerriSewell for her sportsmanship. Enjoy the barbecue, #TeamSewell! #GoDawgs https://t.co/TUXD21U1HeThe notion that @NancyPelosi is congratulating her allies for “courage” and “leadership” really shows how misguided they truly are… Blocking funding for our military and children’s healthcare shouldn’t be considered “courage” or “leadership” in anyone’s book. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/YS7DPg6Q3RAt the heart of this debate is Life. Today’s passage of the #BornAliveAct sends a clear message by establishing real consequences for those who kill or abandon innocent children after leaving their mother’s wombs. Here's why I'm #prolife &amp; #MarchForLife→ https://t.co/uFD54t40UH https://t.co/Rr0kdDiwsIBeing #prolife isn't about being a Republican or Democrat–it’s about protecting 10 fingers, 10 toes, &amp; one precious heartbeat. I challenge all of you to fight for those without a voice–the unborn–because every life is valuable &amp; worthy of protection. #LoveSavesLives #MarchForLife https://t.co/2trNaISt8uKicking off a live Telephone Town Hall right now! I value #GA10’s opinions and concerns so I hope you’ll tune in. Looking forward to a great discussion this evening! https://t.co/waz3UhrjSzKeeping in touch #GA10 is vitally important to me. I always look forward to the chance to engage with residents, answer your questions, and listen to the issues that matter to you most.

The video below explains what HASC is and what this means for #GA10. I'm looking forward to serving in this role and working diligently with my colleagues to fulfill our sacred Constitutional duty to defend America. https://t.co/nVfOdyzX9jIs $1000 "crumbs" to you? Less than a month after its passage, the #TaxCutsandJobsAct is spurring positive results for folks nationwide. While it’s unfortunate that fancy @NancyPelosi considers bonuses &amp; increased wages crumbs, I’m pleased that Americans are seeing real benefits. https://t.co/bQMTfPf7n3First Lady Nancy Reagan was an American icon, plain &amp; simple. Someone who put duty, honor, &amp; country above all, while also standing alongside President Reagan through every trial &amp; tribulation. Proud to introduce a bill to rename Gravelly Point as the Nancy Reagan Memorial Park. https://t.co/m559kl4VB8Grateful that @POTUS and @WhiteHouse called on "all Americans to commemorate this day with events and activities that remind us of our shared heritage of religious liberty and teach us to secure this blessing both at home and abroad." #ReligiousFreedomDay 
https://t.co/XZ1SK9c3Em https://t.co/5K5jb5sxjQAmerica is blessed with a rich spiritual heritage.

Congratulations again and look forward to your leadership! #GA10 https://t.co/ccT2MzhbJgDeeply saddened by the passing of one of Georgia’s finest, Doug Barnard. Known as a man of integrity, hard work, passion, &amp; public service, his legacy and influence throughout the Augusta community will undoubtedly live on.
