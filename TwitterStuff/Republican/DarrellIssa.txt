It’s wrong that Americans must ask their government for permission to do their jobs. You shouldn’t need a license to braid someone’s hair. I’ve introduced legislation with @SenMikeLee to tackle this issue. I’m glad some in California are following suit. https://t.co/fRCqM7WfGTAlways an honor to watch Marine One take off.

Thanks for the invite, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/oo2ppbZ7auThank you for your service, Justice Kennedy! https://t.co/rb83fOZq9j#SCOTUS got it right again. Today's ruling affirms public employees can’t be forced to endorse ideas and unions they find objectionable. Freedom and the First Amendment advance! https://t.co/XTV3lXx2bPPleased to hear SCOTUS upheld @realDonaldTrump’s decision to restrict the entry of dangerous foreign nationals. As the Court firmly held, this decision wasn’t based on religion. Rather, it was based on the neutral idea of safety &amp; protecting the United States' national security. https://t.co/dvWGKtGyotAfter 68 years, the bodies of our fallen heroes are coming home. Words cannot describe how thankful we are for their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/bNBZoDAeKDIt did! The #IGReport shows cumulative bias from top FBI officials like Peter Strzok. 

I demand Strzok to tell us otherwise during his deposition before the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. https://t.co/enCMX91sq2It was great to meet with Brianna and Luke today, and congratulate them on being Congressional Award Gold Medalists.

Afterwards, we had the privilege of witnessing a group of Americans get sworn into the U.S. Army. God bless these soldiers as they begin their service. https://t.co/L3opOPcgZz@realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryRoss' trade deal with ZTE was justified and firm.

Better yet, support it. https://t.co/BidHJ98usGCheck out my new op-ed in the @DailyCaller about the Senate's decision to reverse @realDonaldTrump's trade deal with Chinese telecommunications company ZTE.

If we are to restore faith in the FBI as an institution, we must clean house to reestablish the American people’s confidence in the Bureau. https://t.co/LYnceRemKeHappy 243rd birthday @USArmy!

As @Jim_Jordan's 2013 questions show, Mueller didn’t seem all that interested in a thorough investigation when Tea Partiers were the victims and Obama’s IRS was the perpetrator. https://t.co/hpucagKOjdI’m proud to have cosponsored and voted for #RightToTry. This new law will change lives by allowing patients with life threatening illnesses to have access to potentially life-saving experimental treatments. https://t.co/ygt0tUfRNyThanks for having me!
