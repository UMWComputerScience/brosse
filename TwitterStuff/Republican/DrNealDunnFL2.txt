No child should ever have to go to school in fear.It was great meeting with leadership from Tallahassee Community College and the Central College of Florida yesterday. We discussed their plans for the future and how Congress can help them achieve their goals of educating our youth. https://t.co/rbptLjuMfuMore good news because of the tax cuts law – Main Street job creators are expanding and optimism is at a 45-year high.

https://t.co/lXHYL7zapPPresident Trump is keeping his promise to cut government red tape and give more power back to taxpayers.

https://t.co/g7CVtphG4lThanks to the tax cuts law, hardworking Americans across the country are getting wage boosts and keeping more of what they earn.  

https://t.co/j5ps1S0j1CWe cannot allow our military and national security to be held hostage by those who want to continue the reckless spending of the last administration. This is not how our government is supposed to work, and I believe we need reforms in how the Senate treats appropriations bills.When I ran for Congress I pledged to do all I could to begin rebuilding our military, and this bill accomplishes this critical task. I’m deeply disappointed that Senate Democrats refused to pass the defense bill the House has sent to them not once but four times.Investing in our defense operations gives certainty to our warfighters on the front lines and strengthens our national security in a dangerous world. That’s why President Trump and Secretary Mattis strongly supported the budget agreement.By reversing these damaging “sequestration cuts” that have gutted our military and making necessary defense investments, we are beginning to repair a decade’s worth of damage.Right now, we have ships that cannot go to sea, planes that cannot fly, and troops without the equipment they need to deploy.It is wrong for us to send our best young men and women into harm's way without the resources they need, asking them to make up with their efforts, and their risk, for our shortcomings.Congress has passed a budget deal to fully fund our military by reversing harmful “sequestration cuts” and keep our government up and running.It’s time for the Senate to get its act together. The House has passed full defense funding three times in the last year. And tonight, we will do it for a fourth time. #SetOurTroopsFree https://t.co/S7OEqLPqhnOur modern heroes bear the heaviest burden and the greatest risks in our defense. Secretary Mattis is right – it’s time for the Senate to step up and pass full funding for our troops down range.

https://t.co/3Njoz2KNiLMy full statement on the release of the memo --&gt; https://t.co/PAOS3FaNBqThe American people deserve transparency and releasing this memo is a step in the right direction in restoring faith in our justice system.

I urge Attorney General Sessions to continue doing all he can to ensure each and every American receives equal justice under law.There cannot be two standards of justice, one for Republicans and another for Democrats. We must return to a Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Department of Justice that we can trust.President Trump made the right decision to allow for the release the memo to the American people. 

The memo demonstrates how politicized federal law enforcement had become during the Obama Administration. The police power of the state must be blind to politics.It’s February and the tax cut law is delivering bigger paychecks. #CheckYourCheck

These leaders are doing great work promoting agricultural education in North Florida. https://t.co/FHN2qdiyEUThey all raced to provide care for the injured, and comforted and aided people on the train. We came together and worked as a team, with  dozens of members and staff pitching in to help with medical care and safety.Leah and I are saddened by the tragic train accident that occurred today in Crozet, Virginia and we are praying for the victims and their families. We were unhurt.

#ReleaseTheMemoI feel strongly that the findings of the committee should be released to the American people. Releasing this information poses absolutely no risk to American intelligence operations. #ReleaseTheMemoThis memorandum addresses the findings of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence regarding the  involvement of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the Presidential election of 2016.
#ReleaseTheMemoDemocrats in the Senate are holding the government, funding for our troops, and health care for 9 million children hostage over the issue of illegal immigration. The House did its job and voted to keep the government open, it’s time for the Senate to step up.

In its decision upholding the law, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the ACA’s individual mandate is a tax. https://t.co/m3VuqOCWJJThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act preserves the medical expenses deduction and the deduction for classroom supplies. It also does not tax the value of graduate school tuition waivers. Current law does not change for any of these provisions in the tax code. https://t.co/CI64T0AorpTaxpayers can still deduct interest incurred new mortgages with principal over $750,000, but only interest payments associated with the first $750,000.

For new mortgages, taxpayers may deduct interest incurred on principal up to $750,000. https://t.co/uyEOo5PvBy...with one of the highest tax rates in the world … That’s why my administration released a … framework that lowers the corporate tax rate and broadens the tax base in order to increase competitiveness for companies across the nation.”The bill cuts the rates for the same reason President Barack Obama wanted to in 2012: “Our current corporate tax system is outdated, unfair, and inefficient,” he said. “It provides tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas and hits companies that choose to stay in America..The bill changes U.S. corporate rates – which are currently the highest in the world – to match our trading competitors in Europe.

The bill puts more of the overall income tax burden on the wealthy, not less.Low- and middle-income taxpayers receive the largest percentage cut in the bill. The group of taxpayers making between $40,000 and $50,000 per year will pay 56% less in taxes. https://t.co/YXcbDoMIgGMerry Christmas! https://t.co/A0UcvkETNTA family of five earning $65,000 will go from owing $735 to Uncle Sam under current law to getting a $1,460 check from the IRS because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

For instance: https://t.co/FkND9IoXxSThe bill replaces personal exemptions with a roughly doubled standard deduction, lower tax rates across-the-board, and a doubled child tax credit. This results in a lower overall tax bill.A family of four making $55,000 will get a $1,500 tax cut. A single mother with one child making $30,000 will get an $800 check from the government.The child tax credit is doubled to $2,000 per child ($1,400 of which is refundable, meaning you can benefit from it even if you have a negative tax liability and don’t owe the government any tax).The bill cuts taxes for the middle class. The 15% bracket is cut to 12%. The 25% bracket is cut to 22%. The standard deduction (claimed by 81% of residents in Florida’s Second District) is roughly doubled to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. https://t.co/uPecHyFcVzThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will lower taxes on middle and lower income Americans. https://t.co/6ZHQuDSKgeGreat news – my legislation to expand job and educational opportunities in the STEM fields for veterans passed the House this week!
