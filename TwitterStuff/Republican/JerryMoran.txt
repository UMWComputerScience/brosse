Keep publishing papers, today and every day – the First Amendment is essential to our American freedoms. Our prayers are with you, @CapGazNews. https://t.co/r8rk5oCi8GNEWS → The Senate just overwhelming passed the #FarmBill18. This bill will provide stability for our farmers &amp; ranchers and I’m pleased my amendment to allow for advance payments through ECP was included. Thank you to @SenPatRoberts for leading the Senate through this process.As a nation, we are grateful for Justice Kennedy’s many years of service. I look forward to evaluating @POTUS’s nominee and working with my Senate colleagues to thoroughly assess his or her qualifications and confirming to the bench a jurist who is a defender of our constitution.Headed to the Senate floor to speak about my #FarmBill priorities, including my amendment to provide advance ECP payments. This legislation gives farmers stability during highly uncertain times. Watch my remarks here:  https://t.co/05M1huGcmqSaddened to hear about the tornado in Eureka.

Taiwan is a vibrant democracy and a key trade partner for Kansas and the U.S., and it is important for our nation to stand firm in our friendship to Taiwan.I was saddened to hear of the passing of Dr. Charles Krauthammer –a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, an icon for the truth and an advocate for thoughtful, intellectual debate. Our country is better off because of the wisdom he shared with us. https://t.co/LdFuI1SNERFinally, tanker progress for Wichita. After months of waiting, I’m eager to see the first KC-46 air refueling tanker arriving at McConnell AFB in October. This is the result of years of preparation from the @22ARW, 931st and the civilians on #TeamMcConnell. Good news for Wichita! https://t.co/HszA61aoGrIntroduced the Keep Families Together &amp; Enforce the Law Act. This bill would #KeepFamiliesTogether during legal proceedings, protect children, authorize 225 more immigration judges &amp; ensure the integrity of our immigration laws.Whatever one’s views are on fixing our broken immigration system, no child – especially a child with Down syndrome – should be mocked. This response does not align with our values as Americans and does not contribute to our efforts to end the current circumstances. https://t.co/re0CP713yoGreat to meet with @AlzAssociation today during its 2018 Advocacy Forum. I appreciate the good work of the Alzheimer’s Association as we work to try and make certain that in the future, no individual or family has to experience the impact of this disease. #EndAlz https://t.co/yySZQ6KNzgOn my way to chair a @SenateCommerce subcommittee hearing regarding Cambridge Analytica and the role that third party companies play in the collection and sharing of the personal data of social media users. You can watch the hearing here: https://t.co/Uf6qfmOA3SOur country must make the well-being of these children a priority. We can find appropriate ways to secure our borders and deter illegal immigration in a moral way that honors our values as Americans.Our immigration system is broken. This has become more evident in the last week when children are being forcibly separated from their parents. I oppose this policy and am working with my Senate colleagues and administration officials to bring the current circumstances to an end.Congrats to the “Mamba” and its team members from @KUAerospace for being one of ten winners in the @Boeing @GoFlyPrize competition. https://t.co/gV4CnDDQ9ARobba and I are heartbroken by this news and will continue to pray for these two Wyandotte County deputies and their families. https://t.co/zadXccLkC3With wheat harvest fully underway across the state, I join many Kansans in hoping for a safe and successful harvest for our farmers during this special time. #WheatHarvest18 https://t.co/HvkyBFMpapMembers of my D.C. staff this morning joined @USArmy for the #ArmyBDay run at Arlington Cemetery.

https://t.co/v3818puhNgNow law, the #VAMISSIONAct will provide much-needed relief to veterans in Kansas and across the nation. I am grateful for @POTUS's support of this bipartisan legislation and for his work to help get it across the finish line. #CompleteTheMISSION https://t.co/2KiLuI08dlHeaded to the White House, where @POTUS will sign the #VAMISSIONAct into law. This important legislation will empower our veterans and dramatically improve and modernize their healthcare services.

Watch the signing ceremony live:
https://t.co/B8boAlVHeJContinuing my investigation w/ @SenBlumenthal into systemic abuse within Olympic &amp; amateur sports. It's imperative we get answers to our questions: who knew about the abuse? When did they know? What did they do with that information? And, importantly, why? https://t.co/BRM56uneECMany of our Olympic athletes who stood tall on the international stage were suffering behind the scenes — their stories break our hearts and motivate us to work toward real, lasting change. I look forward to continuing our work to drive out this disturbing abuse. https://t.co/8c4RXbJItnI am honored to be here today alongside athletes demanding change and am continually impressed by the way they represent our country and their sport – both in &amp; out of the gym. Their insight is imperative as we continue working to protect our athletes. https://t.co/eIL4tkJlIlI commend @AjitPaiFCC for announcing – in response to a bipartisan letter &amp; legislation I introduced with @SenatorWicker &amp; @SenatorHassan – his support of a 90-day extension to the challenge process for the map of eligible areas for Mobility Fund Phase II Support. Full letter: https://t.co/Oi45xRA2g2Via @MERCnewsroom: "Perdue says NBAF will be a 'jewel' for Kansas." I agree, @SecretarySonny. Thank you for visiting Kansas this week – I appreciated our trade &amp; farm bill discussions.
 
https://t.co/NSqc3I8cxALive now. https://t.co/cADY7V19kzToday and every day, we thank God for the heroes we have been given and recognize the debt of gratitude we owe them. Happy #MemorialDay. https://t.co/C1bICKDRuoIn my Commerce, Justice, Science &amp; Related Agencies subcommittee hearing, I expressed to @JimBridenstine my objection to @NASA's FY19 budget request to close its education office given the impact this proposal would have on NASA’s #STEM education role → https://t.co/k2V2vPf13HThis is a big deal for veterans... Say goodbye to the arbitrary 30-day/40-mile Veterans' Choice eligibility requirements. #CompletetheMISSION https://t.co/kCAYiaBcLgI’m proud the Senate overwhelmingly supported the #VAMISSIONAct that empowers our veterans and provides our nation’s heroes with the timely and quality healthcare they deserve. With Memorial Day approaching, I look forward to @POTUS signing this bill into law. https://t.co/9r8Phx6nka1⃣2⃣ We’re working hard to foster innovation within the VA. This bill creates the VA Center for Innovation, allowing the VA to develop and carry out pilot programs to explore innovative approaches to improving care, access to care and cost of care to better assist our veterans. https://t.co/PrEvACFjBz1⃣1⃣ The VA is known as a high-quality provider of telemedicine, but the opportunity to expand that – especially for rural veterans or veterans needing specialty care – is one that I am pleased we incorporated into the #VAMISSIONAct. https://t.co/9NrpI8klmk🔟 The #VAMISSIONAct provides additional funds to maintain the Veterans' Choice Program during the development and implementation of the new Community Care Program and removes the barrier between Choice-specific funds and other community care funds. https://t.co/08JN9HUCec9⃣ Walk-in care is becoming more common. This legislation allows our veterans to receive care from local walk-in clinics, convenient-care clinics &amp; federally-funded health centers, giving veterans the same access to non-emergent convenience care in the community as non-veterans. https://t.co/yZwcqIAuQt8⃣ Representing a rural state, I am pleased the #VAMISSIONAct requires community care be paid for at critical access hospital designation Medicare rates, encouraging our rural hospitals to accept veterans into their community care program. More information ↓ https://t.co/n6XHL2uvvm7⃣ #VAMISSIONAct requires market area assessments to determine where VA care is available in the community &amp; where it excels. These assessments will provide Congress a better understanding of redundancies &amp; what kind of care is in the best interest of the veteran. https://t.co/kkzLpIsMyV6⃣ Too often veterans must return to the VA every time they need treatment stemming from the original purpose of seeking care in the community. This legislation cuts red tape by making certain an entire episode of care is treated to completion in the community. More ↓ https://t.co/dX3CVzZYac5⃣ Veterans will now have the ability to appeal a decision made by the VA if they believe their VA provider is wrongly denying them access to community care – giving the veteran an additional option for recourse and putting their care decisions back in their own hands. https://t.co/Et9GF0WHej4⃣ The #VAMISSIONAct reforms community care eligibility – a big win for veterans. This legislation replaces the existing, arbitrary 30-day/40-mile eligibility requirements with simply what is in the best interest of the veteran. https://t.co/DejwUqWfvS3⃣ This legislation requires the VA to provide veterans a coordinator of care when they choose to utilize care in their community to ensure continuity of care and service in a timely manner, making it easier for a veteran to receive the care they need. https://t.co/pB79tmTfqI2⃣ There are seven different community care programs within the VA where veterans can access care outside of the VA. These programs are consolidated into one under the #VAMISSIONAct, reducing bureaucracy and making the program easier for veterans and their providers. https://t.co/NDbkVtplTT1⃣ #VAMISSIONAct makes certain the VA executes the law consistent with the intent of Congress as it develops rules &amp; regulations to govern the new Choice program – preventing the VA from narrowing &amp; limiting the program's ability to serve veterans as we intend &amp; they deserve. https://t.co/RXtcTlaUh4I spoke on the Senate floor in support of the #VAMISSIONAct – I am grateful for @SenJohnMcCain’s leadership on this reform effort and have enjoyed working alongside him to do right by our veterans. 12 reasons why we must #CompleteTheMISSION:This is a good day for justice in our state. We must continue to reject hatred that imperils the safety and morals of our communities. I remain inspired by Alok Madasani and Ian Grillot’s courage and am saying a prayer for Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s family.
https://t.co/q4wpATLNYyJoined colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce The FARMERS FIRST Act to reestablish the Farm &amp; Ranch Stress Assistance Network, among other important provisions. We must continue working to equip farmers with mental health resources they need. https://t.co/i2rK5Ko49cIt is time for us to #CompletetheMISSION and pass #VAMISSIONAct. It is more than appropriate to honor those who served our country at this point in May, in which Memorial Day is around the corner, to provide the care that they are asking for. https://t.co/qyfijbDa1vQuestioning @FBI Director Christopher Way on department's FY2019 budget request in my Senate Appropriations Subcommittee.

Tune in! https://t.co/wWp3f8o0QgThis is a tough job and the VA needs strong leadership. The VA &amp; members of Congress must be singularly focused on prioritizing veterans above all else, moving quickly to pass Choice reform and upholding an unquestionable commitment to service and providing quality care.This critical position must be filled promptly. The person who becomes our next secretary of the VA will have a direct impact on the well-being of nearly 200,000 Kansans and millions of veterans across the country.I have a very high standard for the individual who runs the VA, and I appreciated the discussion I had with Rear Admiral Jackson regarding his vision for the department. However, I respect his decision to withdraw from consideration.According to @CDCgov, #opioid overdoses are #1 cause of accidental death in the US – 115 people every day die from opioid-related causes.

Read more in my @KCStar editorial here: 
https://t.co/mCeiXPpbzDIt is concerning that allegations of privatizing @DeptVetAffairs healthcare are being used as a distraction from the VA’s solemn responsibility to support those the VA was created to serve. This false narrative diverts attention from the very real problems that persist at the VA."The @DeptVetAffairs should remain a primary and important part of veterans’ lives... However, we must not turn our back on the 1.6 million veterans who want and need Choice and those who rely on access to care in their community or risk not having access to care at all." https://t.co/yCW4JvTkXJVeterans deserve a @DeptVetAffairs worthy of their sacrifice, which requires leadership at the top that is focused on changing VA bureaucracy.
