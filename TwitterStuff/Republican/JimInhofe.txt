A win for the First Amendment. Americans should not be forced to pay for union services if they don’t choose to join. I am pleased #SCOTUS stood up for freedom of speech again today. https://t.co/DxxhuXwG23#SCOTUS' decision to uphold @POTUS' authority to address nat'l security issues is a victory for American safety &amp;security. He is well within his authority to pass travel restrictions against countries w/ internal unrest &amp;instability that prevent thorough vetting of individuals. https://t.co/YxLmALOkq6#SCOTUS ruling in #NIFLAvBecerra is a win for life.

The California law would have likely forced crisis pregnancy centers to violate their strongly held religious beliefs - something protected by the First Amendment and freedom of speech.

Full statement: https://t.co/gKUFe35eIN https://t.co/3rorHjRgEoProud of the work we did to secure nearly $4 million in fed grants for Bristow’s Jones Memorial Airport.

I joined @POTUS at the @WhiteHouse this afternoon. Watch the coverage below from @FoxNews: https://t.co/Vx5vZiPJcsYesterday, the @realDonaldTrump admin showed yet again that we are committed to supporting our ally Israel. The decision to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council comes after the council—
time &amp;time again—has shown bias against &amp;unjustly targeted our friend in the Middle East. https://t.co/yAtOwattfAIn addition, I've sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristjen Nielsen and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar to urge them to use their existing authorities to prevent the separation of children and parents at the border. https://t.co/5bvYYz6BUJLearn more about this important legislation here: https://t.co/Jcaqikv2bNI’m taking action to stop the separation of parents and children at the border by cosponsoring @SenTedCruz’s Protect Kids and Parents Act.

FFA allows students to explore their interest in agriculture while developing life-long leadership skills. https://t.co/yPcvJng21jThe NDAA is more than just a piece of legislation, it’s what we have to do to defend America. After all, the number one thing we should be doing here in the House and the Senate is defending America. 

https://t.co/5pomM7hBgXWith @realDonaldTrump's signature, the VA MISSION Act became law today. Oklahoma has made significant developments in the past two years to ensure our veterans get the care they deserve.

Great to see so many young Oklahomans at the nation’s Capitol! https://t.co/6IhnYoAwa1Tune in soon — I’ll be discussing North Korea with @JonScottFNC on Fox News' @HappeningNow. https://t.co/F64VYQmWaSGeorge Washington was steadfast in his belief of God, His law &amp; that liberty is God’s gift. His leadership was based on the conviction that Americans are entrusted by God to preserve basic freedoms in the Constitution, including religious liberty. Today that freedom was upheld. https://t.co/jSeToPE5LaThe title speaks for itself. https://t.co/c7LmLiBCoHIn Afghanistan, we spoke w/service members &amp;Gen.

God bless the members of our Armed Forces, their families and the United States of America. https://t.co/LYw7Xp4fcvFrank, one of my former staffers, can use his leadership and expertise effectively to advance American energy dominance and enforce energy sanctions, like those against Russia and Iran.

The #FY19NDAA supports our military presence by ensuring the latest training, equipment &amp;provisions are available to improve our military families' lives.It takes a dedicated, consistent approach—one he clearly presented in this year’s bill. I applaud Chairman @SenJohnMcCain’s leadership and commitment to ensuring our military is well-trained and that the equipment they use is sufficiently maintained and combat-ready.Under the @POTUS admin, we have been able to begin the long process of rebuilding our military after eight years of chronic underfunding &amp; budget cuts. Chairman @SenJohnMcCain fully appreciates continuing to rebuild our armed forces cannot be accomplished in just a year or two.As Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I prioritized maintenance &amp; modernization efforts that will allow us to remain competitive against China &amp; Russia’s advancements and sponsored provisions to support critical partners in Africa, Taiwan and the Kurdish Regional Government.Earlier this year, @realDonaldTrump outlined the first National Defense Strategy in over a decade that correctly prioritized the growing threats to our country and the direction of our military. Today’s #NDAA reflects and supports this strategy.

https://t.co/0YTwjyTZJmWhat a win for local OK banks! W/ @realDonaldTrump's signature, we rolled back the #DoddFrank regulations that forced local banks to spend more &amp;more of their time &amp;resources complying w/ gov't mandates—driving up costs for families, small businesses, farmers &amp;ranchers. No more. https://t.co/2CiDi92emR@POTUS Remember that the admin’s strong sanctions—the ones that brought NKorea to the table &amp;led to the release of the 3 Americans—are still in place. As NKorea remains economically &amp;diplomatically isolated from the world, I believe that they will be willing to come back to the table.This is a continuation of @POTUS' tough talk &amp;clear expectations for NKorea. He’s never wavered from the commitment that talks had to be about complete denuclearization. If there was an indication Kim Jong Un was not willing to uphold that, then POTUS was right to cancel.TUNE IN NOW: I'm going LIVE with Tod Tucker and @RepMullin this morning on @KOKCradio to discuss important topics including Memorial Day, veterans and the NDAA. https://t.co/wZUj5GdM6VSince '15, OK has turned a corner, making meaningful changes to ensure our vets get the care they earned. The #VAMISSIONAct builds on this w/ improved efficiency in VA community care programs, more access to vet caregiver resources, &amp;continued funding for the VA Choice program. https://t.co/3XKpYPWZVTChina has illegally claimed and fortified these islands in the South China Sea as if they are preparing for World War III. I applaud @POTUS and Sec Mattis for clearly sending a message that China’s continued aggression in the region will not go unchecked.
https://t.co/106xeZ7juqWith @realdonaldtrump, we have a truly pro-life president.

Full segment w/ @DavidAsmanfox on @AftertheBell: https://t.co/DsRxC8bvmN.@POTUS's proposal recognizes this problem &amp; prioritizes responsible permitting reform. He’s serious about restoring US ability to build critical infrastructure on budget &amp; on time. We need to cut red tape to ensure needed projects can get off the ground.
https://t.co/LTYsS9BWULThe private sector is ready and eager to invest in many of these critical projects but has been hesitant to jump because our flawed permitting process means their investment may take years

Hear what he had to say: https://t.co/JpJkeebMvsWe’ve made great progress to improve the standard of care our veterans receive. We must now seek to instill that attitude in VAs around the US. 
I was on @koconews, @OKCFOX, @2WorksForYou and @kfor talking about my new bill to help OK VA facilities lead the nation in vets care. https://t.co/x7wDIp1r5qLast week, @SenatorLankford, @RepMullin &amp; @RepRussell joined me to intro legislation to help Oklahoma VA facilities lead the nation in veterans care. We’ve made great progress to improve the standard of care our vets receive, but we're not done yet. Read: https://t.co/MsnKzplJkc https://t.co/Fz4kEPlIHOIt was a pleasure to meet with the @NORMANCHAMBER last week. I was especially pleased to discuss #DoddFrank reform efforts &amp; @POTUS's infrastructure plan w/ them. Norman knows the value of infrastructure to our local economy &amp; I look forward to continuing our work in the future. https://t.co/fUgXvdcSlBJoined @RepMullin and our local VA officials today to announce an initiative to have our Oklahoma VA facilities lead the nation in veterans care. 

Read more about our work with @SenatorLankford and @RepRussell: https://t.co/MsnKzplJkc https://t.co/nphRuHuKLH@realDonaldTrump The United States has always said that any talks with North Korea would have to include their complete, irreversible and verifiable denuclearization. I am pleased that both South Korea and Japan share that commitment and am hopeful that the talks reveal this outcome.Tonight makes it clear that @realdonaldtrump’s tough talk, campaign of maximum pressure &amp; aggressive sanctions are working against NKorea. Kim Jong Un’s willingness to refrain from future missile testing &amp; come to the table to talk about denuclearization is a tangible first step..@MariaBartiromo &amp; I discussed the #DoddFrankRollback this morning on @MorningsMaria. The big problem we had w/ the past president is overregulation. Bankers will tell you that. W/ the rollback of #DoddFrank, we can get much needed #Relief4MainStreet. 

https://t.co/x8ZBObfkbD https://t.co/hyxkK3gUnHI had the chance to speak with @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria about North Korea this morning. Kim Jong Un is now willing to negotiate because of @realDonaldTrump's tough stance. I saw that firsthand when I recently visited the DMZ.

Full Segment: https://t.co/EtGO4U4VfX https://t.co/AVK4XRcIevI agree with @StateDept Sec. Tillerson. If you missed his speech today, you can watch it below. You can also check out my op-ed about bringing @POTUS's "America First" agenda to Africa and treating them as partners here --&gt; https://t.co/KRjiNu4Vs4 https://t.co/WCIx7EKe1iToday, I am proud to lead the @SASCMajority Readiness Subcommittee w/ @timkaine in writing a letter to urge the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee to give @DeptofDefense necessary flexibility to spend appropriated resources for the remainder of the fiscal year. Letter: https://t.co/w5tBjudcESHappy Birthday to my friend, colleague and fellow Okie, @SenatorLankford! https://t.co/h13xjykH9J@POTUS is getting things done. “With unprecedented speed, the Trump administration has already implemented nearly two-thirds of the 334 agenda items called for by the Heritage Foundation, a pace faster than former President Reagan…” In the @dcexaminer-
https://t.co/sQyhl7Cv8wToday, we honor the life and legacy of my friend Billy Graham as he is laid to rest. You can view his funeral services through the link below: https://t.co/yN0pY5vs3jProud to see the positive results of @realDonaldTrump's decision to provide defensive lethal aid to Ukraine. This president follows through. https://t.co/P0ucPWWEHy https://t.co/OkgU1cvx3lWe discussed #infrastructure this morning in @EPWGOP. I was encouraged by @realDonaldTrump's proposal and I think we can all come together in a positive way. There is no better evidence of this than @SenWhitehouse and I's @WSJ oped published last week: https://t.co/ZzMGgxF6oa https://t.co/tGNu9LT9ZdGlad to take the lead on this with @maziehirono. Expansion of Global Entry to Israel is the commonsense thing to do. https://t.co/otPkUIu9bSGood things are happening. From @CNBC: “Small-business confidence is surging in 2018 as optimism rises among small-business owners about the newly enacted tax-reform package, according to the latest CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey...” Read: https://t.co/9MWJRfY93eDuring my visit to the 7th Fleet in Japan this week, I stopped to observe the progress of repairs to the USS John S. McCain. https://t.co/yPF9W1aohc“Deregulation has been a major focus of the @realDonaldTrump administration, and those efforts have paid off in increased economic activity.” Great perspective from @TheOklahoman. https://t.co/OsYAmpmbqwThe sanctions @POTUS announced today are the strongest yet against North Korea and show our steadfast commitment to our allies. These sanctions come as I am visiting US troops, our partners in South Korea and the Joint Security Area to discuss the serious threat North Korea poses https://t.co/POjUtm1H8DWe should streamline the project approval process so critical ones can get off the ground faster. @USTreasury reports the major obstacles to completing #infrastructure projects include inefficient reviews and lack of public and private entity consensus. https://t.co/ZzMGgxF6oaWe believe state and local leaders should identify and select the projects that are most needed in their communities. There is no one-size-fits-all federal solution for #infrastructure. Local communities know best what they need. https://t.co/ZzMGgxWHfIThe time is right to close the #infrastructure gap. The American economy is strong and poised to continue growing if Congress can work together to make smart decisions. The path to success is to start with shared goals. https://t.co/ZzMGgxWHfI.@SenWhitehouse &amp; I serve on the Senate EPW Cmte, which has jurisdiction over most #infrastructure bills. Despite our differences, the cmte has produced some of the largest &amp;most effective bipartisan legislation of the past decade. We need to do it again.  https://t.co/ZzMGgxF6oaDuring his #SOTU, @POTUS called for a broad bipartisan #infrastructure package. If you believe the news reports on partisan bickering in DC, a bipartisan approach might seem impossible. But @SenWhitehouse and I know it can, and will, happen. Read our oped: https://t.co/ZzMGgxF6oaRev. Graham brought men &amp; women from all backgrounds to the Bible. We have lost a giant today, but I'm confident his work will continue through those he brought to Christ. Kay &amp;I are keeping his family, especially his children, in our prayers as we mourn the passing of my friend.Another great example of how America’s economy is growing and bringing jobs to hard-working Oklahomans. Via @tulsaworld https://t.co/6Rd1hIBBMSGreat news from @Google this week. Their continued investment in Oklahoma will continue to create jobs and grow our economy! https://t.co/0NcdPpKKkVHonored to receive the “True Blue” award from @FRCdc &amp; @tperkins recognizing my votes to uphold conservative values. Working w/ @POTUS, Congress has made progress in advancing our shared values. I'll continue to promote bills that put family values 1st. https://t.co/WRzqeaX5h8 https://t.co/TzfGGAaTP1I talked to @DavidAsmanfox on @FoxBusiness' @AftertheBell this afternoon about the #infrastructure meeting w/ @POTUS yesterday &amp; our need for a major infrastructure package to supplement existing programs &amp; fix a broken regulatory process.

Full Segment: https://t.co/saFZwpWyzk https://t.co/KmG2WDYpkpLanguage has the power to unify people of all walks of life. By recognizing the English language as our official language, we will be promoting unity and ensuring the success of new immigrants.Past OMB estimates have stated that the cost of providing multilingual assistance is between $1-2 billion per year.A 2014 Rasmussen poll found that 83% of Americans support making English the official language of the United States. https://t.co/d8EagOqgOwThe United States is one of only 8 countries in the world that do not have an official primary language. To date – 31 states, including California, Oklahoma, Arizona and more have established English as the official language of the state.My amendment ensures gov't can continue to use other languages in the interest of nat'l security, internat'l relations &amp;trade, tourism or commerce, public health, &amp;protecting victim's rights. Read on for facts on why establishing a nat'l language is common sense &amp;promotes unity:I proposed an amendment to the immigration debate to promote national unity by making English our national language: https://t.co/tsbKTTLxcQ.Tragic, terrible news of the school shooting in Florida. Praying for the victims, their families, first responders and entire community.Grateful to join @realDonaldTrump today to talk about improving our infrastructure. https://t.co/HR98I3bdhxI discussed @POTUS's #InfrastructurePlan w/ @cvpayne on @FoxBusiness this afternoon. The president is going about this the right way &amp; we are working to invest in rural America + streamline regulations to unlock economic opportunity.

Full segment: https://t.co/FEEWiSl9Yw https://t.co/subXS4O7Ym@realDonaldTrump and his admin have worked w/ Congress to ensure our priorities are included in his infrastructure plan. We must work together to stimulate investment, streamline regulations and invest in rural America while providing jobs across the country. https://t.co/rJRRvqCM2d@POTUS's bold infrastructure proposal will provide addt'l resources &amp;reform existing programs to transform how we address infrastructure investment. I appreciate that the plan looks beyond just roads &amp;bridges &amp;includes other needed projects, like waterways, pipelines &amp;broadband. https://t.co/Z5aLEuCOZOWe fulfilled our most important obligation—to provide for our nat'l defense. These resources will go a long way—but we can't afford to let our military funding be held hostage again after this 2 yr deal. We must return to regular order so we can continue to rebuild our military. https://t.co/k7K2dANzPTI spoke with @NewsOn6, @OKCFOX and @KJRH2HD  about the long-term budget agreement our military desperately needs. Our troops are counting on us, and with this deal, we can rebuild. Let’s get this passed. https://t.co/vMDSf94pJEWith this agreement, we’re securing a pathway to fully fund @POTUS's defense priorities while decoupling our military from the Dems’ demands--providing the same level of increases for domestic social spending. Our troops are counting on us. I urge my colleagues to pass this deal.@POTUS joined Congress in rightly prioritizing our military &amp; his NDS recognizes the severe threats we face. Russia, China, North Korea, Iran &amp; Islamic terrorism are stacking up against us. We need to provide significant new resources to our military to address these threats.This deal is necessary b/c it provides funding our military desperately needs. Our armed forces are facing the greatest threats in history &amp; after chronic underfunding by Obama, our readiness &amp; modernization efforts have fallen significantly behind both our adversaries and allies https://t.co/m0qaR6z6o5Tax reform is working. The @HomeDepot is another great example. Proud to have been a part of the largest tax cuts in history with @realDonaldTrump. Read more from @TheOklahoman
https://t.co/BuLPhYfCWJI said it in 2011 and I will say it again: Ronald Reagan was one-of-a-kind. On the anniversary of his birthday, we remember an honest, sincere conservative, at a time when being a conservative wasn't fashionable. 
https://t.co/GLAhaLTw82Very sad to learn of the sudden passing of Sean Murphy, Chief of Staff to Rep. Tom Cole. A dedicated staff member, Sean has served Rep. Cole and Oklahoma faithfully since 2007. Please join me in praying for Sean's wife and their three children..@realDonaldTrump put forth a clear framework on immigration during his #SOTU that addresses many of my priorities for immigration reform, like border security. The framework is a good first step and I look forward to further discussions in Congress..@POTUS said it: “the era of economic surrender is over.” We’re seeing the results of those policies: 2.4 mil jobs, rising wages, lowest unemployment in 45 years and small biz confidence at an all-time high.Good to hear @POTUS talk about streamlining decisions with infrastructure projects during his #SOTU – a long-time priority of mine. Working together, we can get permitting and approval process from 10 years to 2.W/ the economy roaring, the time is right to improve our nation’s infrastructure. @POTUS was clear--we need to address all modes of transportation &amp; types of infrastructure. I especially look forward to working with my Democratic colleagues to modernize &amp; improve all communities.Pleased to hear @realDonaldTrump call for ending the harmful practice of defense sequestration during the #SOTU. He gets it – the Constitution says our priority should be national defense. Eager to work with him on legislation that provides long-term funding for our military.AMERICA GETS A RAISE via @CNNMoney.  @realDonaldTrump’s deregulatory agenda is working. https://t.co/TcI4216oSI.@POTUS is clear-eyed about addressing threats to U.S. families, as his #SOTU reflected. We’re  making sure our enemies fear us and our allies respect us once again. We see this clearly with North Korea. The president hasn’t backed down from threats by an unpredictable dictator..@realDonaldTrump's #SOTU was a unifying speech that made me proud. Eager to work with him on the important initiatives he outlined, esp. national security, infrastructure and growing the economy.I was on @HappeningNow this afternoon with @JonScottFNC to talk about the #SOTU and how @POTUS made the right call by keeping Guantanamo Bay open.

Read my op-ed here: https://t.co/c5jUOq0N3x.@realDonaldTrump had a great speech tonight, one that demonstrated his commitment to rebuilding our military and investing in infrastructure.

Full segment: https://t.co/663dPVhPux https://t.co/g8ZDNBWGp3I watched our military shrink under the Obama Admin--our quantitative and qualitative advantage diminished. Just one year under @realDonaldTrump &amp;all that is changing for the better.

Trump’s “America First” agenda is perfect for a new chapter in Africa; he and President Kagame can do it together. My Op-ed in @USATODAY --&gt; https://t.co/zbkkfOKd8rAfrican nations want this too. Just look at Rwanda. Less than 20 years ago, Rwanda’s economy was nearly 70% foreign aid. Now, it’s down to a third. I was there in October and their progress is clear — the economy is booming. --&gt; https://t.co/zbkkfOsCgTPresident Trump’s “America First” agenda has reshaped our country in a bold, great way. It’s working. He needs to bring his “America First” approach to Africa. My Op-ed --&gt; https://t.co/zbkkfOsCgTPleased the Senate confirmed R.D. James to be the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works today. I look forward to working with you on important infrastructure issues in Oklahoma. https://t.co/I6n7D3iuJ5Thank you Minister Sinjari for taking time to update us about the current situation in Iraq as well as the KRG’s continued counterterrorism efforts. https://t.co/1w7Vn7zajl https://t.co/W3dEDvDqDSWe are a great team when we do that. https://t.co/pPAA8gN34nAnd the priorities we are supposed to be working on here are defending America. https://t.co/J8nEO6LksSI'm going to keep working towards reopening our government and passing a long term spending bill, but right now, only one thing is clear--it is the American people who will suffer if Sen. Schumer continues his politically motivated shutdown.While I am frustrated that Congress was unable to negotiate a long-term spending deal, I recognize that the only thing worse for our military than a CR is no funding at all. This Democrat shutdown will have serious ramifications for our military-negative impacts we can't afford.Tonight, Senate Democrats overwhelmingly voted against funding for our troops, veterans, seniors and CHIP over illegal immigration.The #NationalDefenseStrategy that #SecDef Mattis announced today is a forward thinking approach to reestablish the United States’ position as the undisputed leader of the free world. My take: https://t.co/955W1oXfqEYou can watch the livestream of @POTUS's  #MarchforLife address here: https://t.co/gXYaHOV68uAs the president prepares to address the @March_for_Life shortly, I want to thank @crossoveronline for allowing me on their show yesterday to talk about the importance of the #ProLife movement. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/2ZOkbXQrdt"Trump to Let Health Practitioners Skip Procedures on Religious Grounds" in @WSJPolitics

The pro-life movement is strong, especially with continued support from President Trump’s administration. 

https://t.co/9efIVFbH7dI sent a letter to the @EPA today supporting @EPAScottPruitt's effort to repeal the Clean Power Plan—a burdensome Obama-era rule that overstepped EPA authority &amp; would have placed costly regulatory burdens on states.

Today, with @realDonaldTrump's signature, we have enacted those reforms into law. https://t.co/ZuOf5dYbN7When this tax cut is combined with @realDonaldTrump's deregulatory agenda, we’ll see businesses expand to new heights, reinvest in the future and create millions of jobs right again here in Oklahoma — not overseas. It’s about time. https://t.co/UVzddykP6GIn case you’ve heard in the media that this bill won’t help you, let’s walk through how this bill will actually cut taxes for an Oklahoma family of four making $65,000 per year. https://t.co/UVzddyCqvgWe're on the cusp of something historic. https://t.co/UVzddyCqvghttps://t.co/OyeUQZEVWlIt feels just like yesterday.

It was a pleasure to chat with this great group of students. https://t.co/QH4ZDOtGwBGood things are happening right now; look at the economy. In the 2nd and 3rd quarter of this year, we have increased the GDP by 3 percent thanks to the leadership of  @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/mLoAQDoyO9If there's ever a joke, it's the Paris Climate Agreement. Glad @POTUS agreed with me and decided to withdraw from the deal. Listen here for my thoughts: https://t.co/O9cvdTrzPu"Growth in US oil output until 2025 will be the strongest seen by any country in the history of crude markets, making it the “undisputed” leader among global producers, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday." -- Great @FT article focusing on US energy independence. https://t.co/LnJXhriorVSmall businesses make up Oklahoma’s brick industry (1400 jobs). Too often, they're targeted w/ excess regulation, forced to spend time &amp; money complying w/ rules ultimately overturned by the courts. We must limit regulatory interference while legal challenges run their course. https://t.co/qWn5MdhiZ0This afternoon, I'll discuss advancements in agricultural technology with a panel of witnesses, including Dr. @shanferrell, @OSUCASNR professor. https://t.co/1O4y0UcbcmThis #VeteransDay I was pleased to announce S.1266, the Enhancing Veteran Care Act, passed the Senate.

Read my Op-Ed in the @tulsaworld here: https://t.co/C6BsfIYV7sThere is no better way to honor our nation’s veterans than by ensuring they get the care and benefits they earned in service to our country.
