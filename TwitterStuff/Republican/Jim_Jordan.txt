The House of Representatives went on record today telling the Department of Justice, "Enough is enough. Give us what we've asked for." 

https://t.co/xtyUe5yge7Mr. Rosenstein, why are you keeping information from Congress?
https://t.co/CcNQtSsT7shttps://t.co/XxwK31RzXVToday, @RepMarkMeadows and my resolution is on the floor of the House. It tells Deputy AG Rosenstein to turn over the documents Congress has asked for within 7 days. https://t.co/cZWF6kRbsbWe are sick and tired of the DOJ giving Congress the runaround. As a separate branch of government, we have a right to get information.

@RepMarkMeadows and I want the full weight of the House behind our resolution. It's time to act.
https://t.co/786kj5ZAkiHeading to the Peter Strzok deposition. We have lots of questions that need answers.When you or I go to court, we have to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The FBI did not do that when they took the salacious Steele dossier to the secret FISA Court. 

The DOJ needs to give us answers. https://t.co/SDJE7yIdruPeter Strzok opened the Russia investigation on July 31st. The next day he flew to London. Why was he in London? Who did he talk to? Did he meet with Christopher Steele, the author of the salacious dossier? 
https://t.co/FvEHmEGBnEJudiciary Committee is now working on my and @RepMarkMeadows
resolution for the Sense of the Congress that the DOJ should turn over all documents to Congress. https://t.co/pWr4JprUIpLeadership told us that the conservative immigration bill would only get 150 or 160 votes. When they put it on the floor in front of God and everybody, it got 193. 

We're close. We just need House Leadership to push for this.
https://t.co/RKX6KC4OoYIt never hurts to keep your word. Republicans promised to secure the border. Let's keep that promise.  

https://t.co/QiwwjsyQTyOn July 31st 2016, Peter Strzok opened the Russia investigation. 8 days later, he texted "We'll stop [Trump.]"

It's one thing to say "Trump's awful," but it's another thing to say "We will stop him." How could bias not have impacted Strzok's decisions? 

https://t.co/SDJE7yZOQ4We were a few votes short of passing conservative immigration reform last week. If House Leadership would just whip this bill, we could get it passed.

https://t.co/awruoRU1cUExcited to be joining @margbrennan soon! https://t.co/U1vwAAUKpVOur focus should be on finding the 19 members needed to pass the Conservative Immigration bill. It's the only bill consistent with what we told the American people we were gonna do in the 2016 election. 

https://t.co/HBlRDGQshHWe've seen many encroachments on our liberties from the government. Let's shield reporters from having their First Amendment Freedom of the Press violated.

Prosecute leakers with the full force of the law, but don't go after reporters for doing their job. https://t.co/TsbCUGYQKy6 of the top FBI brass have been fired, demoted, or reassigned following their involvement in both the Clinton and Russia investigations. Peter Strzok is the only one still employed by the FBI.

I have never seen anything like this at a federal agency. https://t.co/xho3Bna0QtWhen the salacious Steele dossier was taken to the secret FISA Court, the FBI didn't tell the court two key facts: who paid for it (the DNC,) and the fact that Steele had been fired by the FBI.

Thankfully, the IG will be looking into these FISA abuses. https://t.co/f5ATOMv3tIWe got to see many Strzok-Page texts over the past several months. We didn't get to see the most important one: "We'll stop [Trump.]" 

Why did Mr. Rosenstein keep that text from us? 

https://t.co/q64XfsPXStDoes Peter Strzok hate the President?

IG Horowitz: "His text messages would certainly give that as the implication." 

https://t.co/BaxLQdBg2RAverage tax cut for a family in OH-04 is $1,481! The economy is growing thanks to #TaxReform. https://t.co/BIySAPJthxPresident Trump is right. We need to pass an immigration bill that’s consistent with the mandate of the 2016 election:

-Secure our borders
-Build the wall
-End chain migration
-End the visa lottery
-Stop sanctuary cities
-Reform asylum lawsThe #IGReport says “we did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision [to prioritize the Russia investigation over the email investigation] was free from bias.”

That’s as strong as it gets in IG speak. https://t.co/IiGFRp0BM2Happy birthday, @POTUS! https://t.co/dh9zFXSH5iThe #IGReport makes it overwhelmingly clear that the FBI top brass was obsessed with the media.

Maybe if they didn’t have more than a dozen individuals contacting a single reporter, they would have actually run a real investigation. https://t.co/p6Uth626SAFBI Attorney #2

-On the Clinton investigation
-Primary attorney on the Russian investigation 
-On Mueller‘s team
-Removed from Mueller’s team in 2018.

Who is this person? #IGReport https://t.co/r8LyT8XBJOHey Deputy AG Rosenstein, who is Attorney #2? #IGReport https://t.co/r8LyT8XBJOThe FBI didn’t want Trump to be President. Peter Stzrok’s text says “we’ll stop it.” The day after the election, FBI Attorney #2 said he was “stressed about what I could have done differently.” 2 weeks later he said “Viva le resistance.

This is as wrong as it gets. #IGReport https://t.co/teeOkNbcUqCongress needs to go on record and say “Mr. Rosenstein, we as the House say that you’re not giving us the information we need. Turn over the documents. Now.” 
https://t.co/Z9i5k4lQ8bCongress needs to act to compel the DOJ to turn over the documents they owe us. You can read @RepMarkMeadows and my resolution here: https://t.co/GaFZf9ypOPRod Rosenstein threatened congressional staff. When the bully picks on your little brother, you have to respond. It's time for House Leadership to stand up. https://t.co/2S369POrge@RepMarkMeadows and I are introducing a resolution that would give the DOJ seven days to turn over the documents that they owe Congress. We need to vote on this immediately.I’ll be going on @IngrahamAngle with House Freedom Caucus Chair @RepMarkMeadows shortly. Tune in!The 2016 election was about border security. We need to pass the Goodlatte bill, which is consistent with the mandate of that election. It's about keeping our word.

https://t.co/OQCwvEoa2eCongratulations to @POTUS on the historic summit with North Korea! This is an important step towards greater peace and prosperity for the whole world.We must protect our fundamental rights and liberties that we enjoy under the Bill of Rights and the United States Constitution, including Freedom of the Press.
https://t.co/5kQcCwORVQWe're focused on doing what we told the American people we were going to do, what they elected us to do, and what we promised we would do.

https://t.co/odtPumzrFoWe need to secure the border, build the wall, end chain migration, reform the visa lottery, and stop sanctuary cities. Once we have that, we can talk about DACA.

DACA recipients should go through the same process as legal immigrants. They shouldn't get a special pathway. https://t.co/JOvvSLdaucWhen it comes to immigration reform, let's just do what we told the American people we were going to do.Happy birthday to my good friend, @VP Pence! https://t.co/lfMgLFxnDLOn this day 74 years ago, over 4,000 Allied forces died launching the liberation of Europe. May their sacrifice for our freedom always remain an inspiration to us. #DDayRemembered https://t.co/3CDmJoOZSC@CNN @POTUS President Trump is keeping his promises. Congress isn’t. 

Congress needs to keep the promises that we made to the American people in the 2016 election.@CNN @POTUS Compare this success to Congress. Other than tax cuts, what has Congress done that is worthwhile?@CNN @POTUS Taxes have been cut. The economy is growing. Unemployment is down to 3.8%. Gorsuch is on #SCOTUS. ISIS is retreating. The Iran deal is dead. North and South Korea have met. The hostages have come home. The embassy was put in Jerusalem.Here's something that @CNN won't tell you: @POTUS has had a tremendous first year and a half in office.https://t.co/bgDmQWWRKrhttps://t.co/edCErmHdyShttps://t.co/uYD1iGyMIEHappening now—Every week we learn more about the FBI/DOJ’s questionable actions during the 2016 election. The DOJ cannot investigate itself. That’s why we’re calling for a second special counsel. It’s time. https://t.co/rjtwW3hpejIt’s high time for transparency. The DOJ and FBI have continually and repeatedly thwarted congressional oversight. We’re asking @realDonaldTrump to direct the Attorney General to give us the documents—because the American people deserve answers. https://t.co/aigq97jm7ACongress can--and must--make sure last month's omnibus spending monstrosity doesn't happen again. @SenMikeLee and I explain how at the @FDRLST.

Let's just do what we said we would do. That'll be good policy for the hard working families of this great country. https://t.co/eJs0W8PqkiWhat's important is not who the next speaker is, but what the next speaker does.

Top brass at FBI/DOJ take “salacious &amp; unverified”(your words, not mine) partisan funded dossier to get secret warrant from secret court to spy on private American on rival campaign. Doesn’t bother you? Bothers me. And more importantly, it bothers the American people.FBI takes "salacious and unverified" dossier to secret court to get secret warrant to spy on a fellow American. 

FBI fires dossier author Christopher Steele, but CONTINUED USING the Steele dossier for secret FISA warrants long after they fired its creator. #NunesMemo #MemoDay https://t.co/qG7CCGIiKpFBI takes "salacious and unverified" dossier to secret court to get secret warrant to spy on an American.

Deputy Director McCabe testified to House Intel committee that without the dossier, "no surveillance warrant would have been sought." #MemoDay #NunesMemo https://t.co/mhSFK2fDaxFBI takes dossier to secret court to get secret warrant to spy on American.

Bruce Ohr worked for DOJ.
Nellie Ohr worked for dossier creator Fusion GPS to cultivate opposition research on Trump.

This connection was "INEXPLICABLY CONCEALED" from secret FISA court. #memoday https://t.co/mvFOszT6Y2FBI takes dossier to secret court to get secret warrant to spy on American. 

FBI did NOT INCLUDE recorded bias of dossier author Steele when he told DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr he "was desperate that @realDonaldTrump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president." https://t.co/Ko0fhYIP7jFBI takes "salacious and unverified" dossier to secret court to get secret warrant to spy on a fellow American, and FBI doesn't tell the court that the DNC/Clinton campaign paid for that dossier.

And they did that FOUR times.

Read #NunesMemo. #MemoDay https://t.co/Ls02ktHcgDFirst the IRS destroyed emails pivotal to our investigation of their political targeting. 

Now the FBI "failed to preserve" texts between Peter Strzok &amp; Lisa Page following the '16 election. 

The time for a second special counsel is now.

https://t.co/BonrBlsJsBStanding for life. Because every life, at every stage, has value. #whywemarch https://t.co/JDOL745In3The American people should be able to read what I did in that briefing room. It's time to #ReleaseTheMemo.

https://t.co/287N3hSGnQGreat interview with my friend @RepDaveBrat. https://t.co/oLRWM0XQu4History shows that governments erode liberties over time. Our 4th amendment was established to protect the privacy and liberty of Americans. The USA RIGHTS Act ensures they continue to be protected. https://t.co/1qEK0FMOT1The government shouldn't be able to  gather information on Americans without warrants. Watch our bipartisan press conference live. https://t.co/x1zkQwimXlIt doesn’t work that way in America. We are not ruled by unelected bureaucrats, police forces, or intelligence agencies. In America, We The People ELECT officials who govern.18) And why would @SenSchumer, leader of the Democrat party, publicly warn President-elect Trump on Jan. 3, 2017 that when you mess with the “intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you?”17) Why won’t the FBI give Congress the documents it’s requesting?16) Why was FBI General Counsel Jim Baker reassigned two weeks ago? Was he the source for the first story on the dossier by David Corn on October 31, 2016? Or was it someone else at the FBI?15) Why did Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson meet with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya before and after her meeting with Donald Trump Jr.?14) The New York Times reported last week that George Popadopoulos’ loose lips were a catalyst for launching the Russia investigation. Was President-elect Trump briefed on this?13) Was the briefing done to “legitimize” the dossier? And who leaked the fact that the briefing was about the dossier?12) Why did the intelligence community wait two months after the election to brief President-elect Trump on the dossier (January 6, 2017)? Why was James Comey selected to do the briefing?11) Why did Lisa Page leave Mueller probe two weeks before Peter Strzok? This was two weeks before FBI and Special Counsel even knew about the texts.10) And why did FBI release only 375/10,000+ texts? Were they the best? Worst? Or part of a broader strategy to focus attention away from something else? And when can Americans see the other 96% of texts?9) Why did the FBI release text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page? Normally, ongoing investigation is reason not to make such information public.8) When and how did the FBI learn that DOJ lawyer Bruce Orr’s wife, Nellie Orr, worked for Fusion GPS? And what exactly was Nellie Orr’s role in putting together the dossier?7) Why did DOJ lawyer Bruce Orr meet with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson after the election? To get their story straight after their candidate Clinton lost? Or to double down and plan how they were going to go after President-elect Trump?6) Why and how often did DOJ lawyer Bruce Orr meet with dossier author Christopher Steele during the 2016 campaign?5) Did Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, or Bruce Orr work on the FISA application?4) Did the FBI validate and corroborate the dossier?3) When did the FBI get the complete dossier and who gave it to them?

Dossier author Christopher Steele? 
Fusion GPS?
Clinton campaign/DNC?
Sen. McCain’s staffer?2) Was the dossier the basis for securing FISA warrants to spy on Americans? And why won’t the FBI show Congress the FISA application?1) Did the FBI pay Christopher Steele, author of the dossier?18 questions in 2018 about Russia and the FBI. The American people deserve answers...https://t.co/FzcXiIpp3CIt's time. https://t.co/qzHmEe0NgUCongratulations to @KayColesJames. An outstanding leadership choice by @Heritage. https://t.co/YMXjg5YwO4Looking forward to it. https://t.co/A5luaUEMfNIf this happened--government working with one campaign to dress up a fake news report as intelligence, then taking it to a FISA court for a warrant to spy on the other political campaign--that's as wrong as it gets. And it shouldn't happen in America.
