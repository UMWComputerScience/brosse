https://t.co/tznC4e7hzzExpanding U.S. exports to #Cuba is the right decision bc it would help level the playing field for farmers and exporters while simultaneously exposing Cubans to American ideals, values and products. @WashDC100 #tradepolicy #trade
https://t.co/2imx2MQq2BWe need to hold China accountable for its unfair trade practices. But not at the cost of the #ag industry which is vital to Arkansas and our national economy.

https://t.co/xF9mIafNTtI appreciate @SecShulkin‚Äôs years of service to our nation‚Äôs #veterans. His efforts to modernize &amp; bring accountability to @DeptVetAffairs is an important legacy. VA must continue to build on that legacy going forward to improve care &amp; delivery of benefits for vets.Glad to see this tool developed to give #veterans the ability to track the status of benefits claims appeals. We know how frustrating it can be waiting to receive an update. Providing vets with more access to information is a good step forward. https://t.co/vc2G1m0b8GI'm so appreciative of @SecAFOfficial for coming to #Arkansas to see the exciting things going on @188thWG &amp; #LRAFB. I think the secretary was served incredibly well by the visit &amp; recognizes how much Arkansas is contributing to national security.
https://t.co/2ogynnJjTpI was honored to receive the Distinguished Patriotic Achievement Award from the Darby @MilitaryOfficer Chapter in Fort Smith last night. They do such important work supporting and advocating for those who serve our country. I appreciate this recognition. https://t.co/CM4o3ol9H2Check out this @5News report on @SecAFOfficial's visit to Fort Smith. Her comments about how their mission is the future of the @USAirForce reaffirm that the 188th is in a great position thanks to smart, forward-thinking decisions. We were excited for her to see that firsthand. https://t.co/5zP97PmGUdAnother great day w/ @SecAFOfficial. We joined @RepFrenchHill to highlight more Arkansas @usairforce installations &amp; cyber capabilities, including #LRAFB cyber security mission &amp; @ucabears cyber range where we heard from students. #BearClawsUp #AimHigh https://t.co/ASAGwnU3lb https://t.co/gs27DYuOqCCheck out my latest column via @TimesRecord about efforts by Congress to end #HumanTrafficking. This modern-day slavery is happening around the world, even in the US. We must continue fighting this heinous crime and holding perpetrators &amp; enablers accountable. https://t.co/JBU5x6sAsEIt‚Äôs been such a pleasure to visit the dedicated men and women at Ebbing Air National Guard Base @188thWG today with @SecAFOfficial. They make us proud and are showing just how valuable Arkansas is to our country‚Äôs national security strategy. https://t.co/hPn8ZVZqDcVery pleased to have @SecAFOfficial Heather Wilson in #Arkansas today. The @usairforce plays a key role in our state and I appreciate the opportunity for @rep_stevewomack and I to give her an update. https://t.co/11rlLuAIAKBREAKING: @ENERGY has terminated its partnership with Clean Line Energy Partners for development of the Plains and Eastern Clean Line Project. This is a big win for #Arkansas and for states‚Äô rights. See full statement from AR Congressional delegation ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/rwjLeTeHuqDespite the breakdown of the process that led us here, I supported the budget bill bc it strengthens our national defense, helps secure our border, addresses critical needs here at home &amp; moves important AR projects forward. See my full statement: https://t.co/8ChWEqlGuc https://t.co/WlpqlMzQeLAnita, my Military &amp; #Veterans Liaison, recently spoke to the Jacksonville Lions Club. She's also our #VeteransHistoryProject point person helping to inform Arkansans and get them involved. As a retired Col. @arkansasguard, she's a great advocate for vets &amp; service members. https://t.co/MVyRD4pfmFAlways nice to see @Strode55 and @S_Heern of @RitterComm to talk about telecom priorities and my work on the Senate Broadband Caucus. Thanks for stopping by! https://t.co/3fQWIS6DwnSo pleased to meet Dawn (@MontanaSky11) of North Little Rock, '18 #MillkenAward winner from AR. Opportunities to celebrate teachers who are doing incredible work in the classroom don't happen enough.

https://t.co/FRLxEJ5Cd6Sending special recognition today to those with Down Syndrome, their families and friends. They are loved, cherished, and fearfully &amp; wonderfully made. We recognize just how special they truly are. @ARDownSyndrome  #WDSD2018 #WorldDownSyndromeDay https://t.co/EN0UxYFYqZThe Senate just overwhelmingly passed #SESTA to hold accountable those companies that knowingly facilitate the exploitation and trafficking of some of the most vulnerable people in our society. WATCH my floor speech from yesterday where I discussed the bill and my support for it. https://t.co/qAZkJQt6Nq#SBDCDay is an opportunity to highlight the #Arkansas Small Business &amp; Technology Development Center's (@ASBTDC) great work. Helping small businesses &amp; entrepreneurs ‚Äì which are the backbone of our economy ‚Äì grow, create jobs and obtain capital benefits our state tremendously. https://t.co/nPLfSKQ0T0Great to see you all and tell you in person how much we appreciate the work you do. I'm a former school board member, so I know how important #education is. As leaders in your schools, you're on the front lines helping to make sure our students are reaching their full potential. https://t.co/ZMw15NcX4OIt's a snowy spring morning here in DC. Thanks to the @uscapitol staff and police for keeping everything running smoothly and helping make sure we're safe. There's a lot on the agenda in the #Senate and we wouldn't be able to do any of it without their work. https://t.co/6BA3lDWRcJ@SOARcwe @SpringdalePD @afterschool4all @SOAR_jones Great job. Very proud of the kids for taking time to help out in their community!My #Senate Broadband Caucus co-chairs &amp; I hosted an event to discuss expanding #broadband access, esp. since technology is becoming so integral to the way we educate students in the 21st century. Closing the digital divide will help kids in rural areas learn at school &amp; at home. https://t.co/n6w68SEFQsShould #SESTA pass, and I believe it will, these bad actors won‚Äôt be able to fade quietly into the dark. We're going to give state attorneys general the authority to prosecute websites that violate federal sex trafficking laws. That‚Äôs why I support this bill.It‚Äôs time to rip the cover away from these bad actors. We are going to do that by making narrowly-crafted changes to the law to ensure websites that knowingly facilitate criminal sex trafficking online are held accountable.#SESTA will help by giving law enforcement and prosecutors additional tools to crack down on human trafficking. It will help us take on nefarious actors like Backpage, who hid behind the Communications Decency Act to avoid prosecution for trafficking crimes.Fortunately, our state is fighting back. Last year Arkansas legislators approved a law requiring state-licensed truckers to be trained in spotting the red flags of human trafficking.Since Polaris began operating over ten years ago, its helplines have received reports of 203 cases of human trafficking from my home state of Arkansas.
¬†
Almost half of those were in the past two years.About to go on the #Senate floor to discuss a bill we're debating this week to combat #HumanTrafficking. Smuggling people for forced labor &amp; sex slavery is a heinous crime. Websites that knowingly facilitate it must be held accountable. #SESTA

Watch here: https://t.co/hlrrfvVJ2qOne way to mark #NationalAgDay is to help current &amp; aspiring farmers ‚Äì including veterans ‚Äì get the tools, technology &amp; resources needed to succeed. My bill w/ @SenatorLeahy,'The Veteran &amp; Beginning Farmers Technical Assistance Act,' does that. Learn more: https://t.co/XWhHVwbknt https://t.co/Ad3iOR6s8yIt was a pleasure to meet w/ Alyssa Johnson, @ArkansasTech student &amp; @ArkansasFFA Vice President. She's advocating for #agriculture on Capitol Hill during #NationalAgDay. I join her in supporting the ag industry bc it's so vital to our state's economy &amp; culture. https://t.co/Ce3KgK7AqJSo great to see Arkansans in DC, but especially when they are supporting a great cause like fighting malaria. Keep up the great work! #endmalaria #NBNSummit https://t.co/dinNjs0XMf#Arkansas leads the nation in poultry production, accounting for 1 in every 4 #ag jobs in our state.

In this clip for the #VeteransHistoryProject she laughs about how even a routine medal pinning meant changing norms https://t.co/uR39Ur5MBBIt was great to see lots of folks representing Community Health Centers of Arkansas (@chc_ar) today to hear about what they‚Äôre seeing in their communities as they deliver care to so many Arkansans. They are a vital resource and I support the work they do. https://t.co/bsUsPLA0eqCommunity banks &amp; credit unions have been unfairly penalized by regulations targeting Wall Street. Eliminating the one-size-fits-all rules for smaller institutions will help free up resources &amp; make it easier to provide capital to small biz so they can invest &amp; hire more workers.We need a regulatory system where small, medium and large financial institutions can succeed. Under Dodd-Frank, we have a system where some financial institutions are too big to fail and others are too small to succeed.The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act will provide much-needed regulatory relief to small banking institutions.I know how important LIHEAP is to #Arkansas. https://t.co/fUf8pWoCJTBailey Alexander, an intern in our Little Rock office, is visiting #Washington with fellow students from @Ouachita.
