A: @JustinOnwenu responds: Yes, we need to do a better job of addressing how information is disseminated. Make sure that students engage and understand what they are being taught.A: Yes. Officers undergo extensive training for responding to &amp; investigating sexual assault. Student that is reporting must be in control of how they respond. This is their choice.

We must also install floodgates and dredge the lake, increasing the water capacity. https://t.co/krLzqeNM0xNow, the city has finally come to their senses. Lake Houston's water levels have been lowered from 42.5 to 40 feet, in anticipation of a significant rain event. This is a good first step &amp; will help prevent the surrounding area from flooding. https://t.co/mmDjTfu77fBack in 2010, Lake Houston was so low that people could practically walk across the lake bed. @DanHuberty @MikeSullivanHTX and I met with the City of Houston and addressed dredging the lake while it was so low. The city refused.Overall, the new KORUS is a victory for free trade, which levels the playing field and reinforces our bond with a crucial American ally. I congratulate Ambassador Lighthizer and @realDonaldTrump on negotiating a great deal.Under updated trade pact:
-U.S. auto &amp; pharm industries gain greater access to South Korean market
-Korea‚Äôs custom procedures reformed to strengthen rules-of-origin requirements
-New process to address currency devaluation that gave South Korean exports an edge will be launchedThe new U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) is good for the American economy, good for American workers, and good for the U.S.-South Korean alliance.This is simple.

Revamp the National Flood Insurance Program, for an effective and sustainable future.8. At a federal level, explore restructuring possibilities for FEMA, removing it from the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security. Create greater accountability within the organization, preventing mass failures that occurred during Hurricanes7. Buyout homes flooded beyond repair. I support homeowners' decisions to pursue a buyout and will work with my colleagues in the county, who ultimately make decision on which particular homes/areas to buyout (the City makes the decision for incorporated areas).6. Increase the capacity of Lake Conroe, lowering the water level before significant rain events.5. Dredge the San Jacinto River, returning to the river's original flow.4. Dredge Lake Houston-Sand from mining operations has spilled into the lake, lowering the amount of water Lake Houston can hold. The sand should be removed from at the cost of the mining operations.3. Require notifications of water release from Lake Conroe &amp; reservoirs. San Jacinto River Authority controls release of H20 from Lake Conroe. Sudden release during Harvey was done w/o prior notice to affected community, 1st responders, &amp; me. This lack of notice is unacceptable.2. Expand the capacity of Addicks and Barker reservoirs, allowing the basins to hold more water backstream, helping mitigate overflow into the immediate communities.1. A third and fourth reservoir must be created, further preventing flooding in the downstream areas including the Lake Houston area.After continually monitoring the recovery process, I believe some of ideas that must be considered are:The state of Texas now determines where this money is spent. It is up to our state and local government officials to act quickly to ensure that these funds are used to help our community recover and prevent future damage.Since Hurricane Harvey rained down on our community, Congress has acted to provide $122.9 billion in total funds for disaster mitigation and flood control efforts.

https://t.co/5kgPxvSZH6We must continue to apply this sustained pressure and peacefully end North Korea's nuclear threat. #NorthKoreaThe sanctions that we have implemented, including designating the rogue nation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, are working. The pressure felt by the Kim regime is insurmountable- exactly as intended. #NorthKoreaPreviously the secretive regime used the discussions to extract concessions and buy themselves time to advance their nuclear programs. The US must stand with our allies and ensure that these proposed talks are not merely a ploy to serve North Korea's interests. #NorthKoreaFollowing the Winter Olympics, North Korea's decision to come to the negotiating table shows promise.
