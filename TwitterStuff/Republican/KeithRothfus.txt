Bring home the gold! #WinterGames2018 #RedWhiteandBlueTrue https://t.co/eB9SCiI5McThe American people and our children deserved a better deal. 6/6The dramatically increased domestic spending level in the bipartisan budget act is the ransom demanded to fund our military. We should not be forced to bankrupt our country in order to defend our country. 5/6The new agreement increases funding the discretionary nondefense side of the government nearly 12% this year and 15% next year above current levels. This is not spending discipline. 4/6We voted to fully fund our military 3 days ago and to continue funding other spending at 2017 levels pending a new budget agreement. 3/6But in 1990s, we learned that to get to a budget surplus, we need not just healthier growth but we need to control spending too. 2/6The tax cuts and jobs act is creating a healthier economy. Growth above 2.6% GDP will generate more tax revenues and actually lower the deficit. 1/6Just as families across the country have to balance a budget and prioritize spending, so should the government. This budget deal piles on to the debt facing our nation, leaving taxpayers and future generations on the hook. https://t.co/2Im2EeRbXUGreat visiting remotely with the Pittsburgh North Regional Chamber to give an update on how #taxcuts are turning this economy around.

Here‚Äôs the simple part: CHIP can be re-authorized, the govt. can be reopened, &amp; paychecks sent to our troops without delay, if @SenSchumer ,@SenBobCasey &amp; @SenateDems changed their votes to make this happen.

This is reckless, irresponsible, and wrong. https://t.co/fafTMttpJHVery disappointed to see #SenateDemocrats vote to shutdown government and not fund children‚Äôs health insurance program. #SchumerShutdownThe House did its job to fund the govt. &amp; to provide 6 years of funding for CHIP, giving millions of children &amp; their families the certainty &amp; stability they need.
