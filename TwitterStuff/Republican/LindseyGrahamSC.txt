I just met with #PastorAndrew Brunson who is being held in a Turkish prison.  He’s not guilty of anything in my view.  We are working very hard to get him home. https://t.co/cn8fxdq0FEWe spoke candidly about Pastor Brunson and other friction points, including the purchase of Russian made S-400s and American made F-35s.  

However, when it comes to the US-Turkey relationship, failure is not an option.Very good, respectful, and candid meeting with President Erdogan.  

We have real differences, but far more in common.  

Turkey needs to be a strategic partner for the US in a win-win fashion. https://t.co/mCc3AjWvVWAs soon as we get a name we’ll go to work to get the person confirmed. https://t.co/tAmaLOd0LvGreat to see @MittRomney win the Utah Senate GOP primary.

The Trump Administration is serious about denuclearization and will not support weak deals with loopholes.@realDonaldTrump I hope President Trump will work with our allies around the world to find a better deal which will truly end Iran’s nuclear weapons ambition and hold them accountable for being the largest state-sponsor of terrorism.@realDonaldTrump Instead, Iran has used the funds provided by sanctions relief to significantly enhance their military capability and create havoc throughout the Middle East.  

They also have used the funds to increase the threats posed to our ally in Israel.@realDonaldTrump They sincerely believed that by providing Iran with sanctions relief, the Iranians would change course and become a better member of the family of nations.  

Those assumptions have proven to be a disastrous mistake.@realDonaldTrump This would have required our Arab allies to develop a nuclear weapon of their own to counter the growing Iranian threat.  
 
There are some who blindly supported this deal, regardless of the risks it posed to our own national security.@realDonaldTrump The agreement has always been fatally flawed when it came to controlling Iranian nuclear ambitions. 

With the mere passage of time, the deal allows Iran to enrich and reprocess uranium – without limitation – on its march toward a nuclear weapon.I strongly support President @realDonaldTrump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.

We're not there yet, but if this happens, President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. https://t.co/XlXWRp2TrIGreat advice and a must-read from @MorganOrtagus on the important role played by US diplomats.

I agree. https://t.co/mzmeTm6lIbPlease join me in wishing a very Happy Birthday to @FLOTUS Melania Trump!@RichardGrenell The extreme partisanship displayed toward Mr. Grenell, a highly qualified nominee from President Trump, will be remembered.I’m glad we have finally confirmed Mr. @RichardGrenell as Ambassador to Germany. 

The nomination was delayed far too long for such an important position and during such troubling times.As to the actions of the forty-two Senate Democrats who voted against his nomination – they should be ashamed of the way they treated Secretary Pompeo.Mike Pompeo will be an outstanding Secretary of State at a time of international upheaval and opportunity.I’m pleased that #MikePompeo has been confirmed as our new Secretary of State. 

He is a highly qualified and incredibly competent choice who enjoys the President’s closest confidence.@EmmanuelMacron @realDonaldTrump President Trump is right to withdraw if the deal is not made substantially better. 

I hope President Macron can convince the world community to bring about the much-needed changes.@EmmanuelMacron @realDonaldTrump As to the Iran Nuclear Deal, it must be made better or we must withdraw. The Iran Nuclear Deal in its current form ensures a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.@EmmanuelMacron @realDonaldTrump In President Macron’s speech about preserving the post-World War II world order and rejecting the false promises of isolationism, I heard the voice of John McCain – an ally and kindred spirit for the thoughts expressed by President Macron.@EmmanuelMacron President Macron has been a great partner to President @realDonaldTrump in confronting the challenges of terrorism and globalization.President @EmmanuelMacron delivered an eloquent and inspiring address to Congress.  

He described the unique relationship between France and the United States which is based on common values that have stood the test of time.Now speaking with @FoxNews @marthamaccallum.

Tune in!Speaking with @FoxNews @marthamaccallum tonight at 7:00 pm about why I support Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State.Speaking with @FoxNews @marthamaccallum tonight at 7:00 pm about why I support Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State.

#ConfirmPompeo@realDonaldTrump As Director of the CIA, Mike has made contacts throughout the world and has come up with aggressive policies to defend our homeland.  

No one understands the threat posed by North Korea and Iran better than Mike Pompeo. 

#ConfirmPompeoOne of the most important jobs for the Secretary of State is to make clear to the world the President’s policies and priorities. 

No one has a stronger relationship with President @realDonaldTrump than Mike Pompeo.

#ConfirmPompeoGreat seeing our @scfirefighters today in Washington.

They are some of the bravest among us!  I’m grateful for all they do to serve &amp; protect our neighbors and communities.

#Heroes https://t.co/xgaTmJwcS0@realDonaldTrump I expect we will – at times – continue to have differences.  
 
I will continue to speak my mind, just like I know he will. 

I think that makes us both better.As to the 2020 presidential race, I believe President @realDonaldTrump will run for reelection and I intend to support him.  

https://t.co/vsExZ1XehG@nikkihaley is doing a great job.  I don't think she was confused either. 

She has been a real strong, clear voice about the misadventures of Russia and why it matters to us as to what happens in Syria. https://t.co/tcw4B4zVLIOne of the greatest First Ladies in the history of our nation has gone to her Heavenly reward.

RIP #BarbaraBushWe will continue to keep the Bush family in our thoughts and prayers.I had the pleasure of meeting her numerous times through the years and can say without hesitation she is one of the most good-hearted people I’ve ever met.  

Faith is sustaining her at this very moment.Like all Americans I’m sending my prayers to former First Lady Barbara Bush and the entire Bush family.Speaking with @hughhewitt at 8:05 this morning about Syria.Speaking with @foxandfriends.

Tune in.I could not agree more. 

If you haven't seen this clip yet, you should watch it: https://t.co/GmTzC1OW5eMy statement on Syria. https://t.co/CG2050uWReWe should apply ‘3️⃣ Strikes, You’re Out’ out to the Butcher of Damascus.   

He’s a monster. He should be considered a war criminal and legitimate military target.Assad:

1️⃣ Was warned by President Obama not to use chemical weapons.

2️⃣ Warned by President Trump not to use chemical weapons.

3️⃣ Continued to use chemical weapons against innocent children anyway.It is imperative that when an American president speaks and warns ruthless dictators not to use chemical weapons against innocent children, those statements actually mean something. 

#SyriaSpeaking with Brian @kilmeade on Fox News Radio.

https://t.co/Y7MRlJ1hJy#FakeNews https://t.co/VXlHiN7yDNI agree completely with Ambassador @NikkiHaley. https://t.co/ksZa4ghsVNAmerica stands up to bullies. 

We do not cower before them.It’s time for America to stand strong and reject the Obama Doctrine of weakness.Both Assad and Putin are weak.  And when it comes to Assad’s outrageous behavior – enough is enough.The worst possible outcome? 

Assad paying a small price – or none at all. Giving him yet another pass – because bully Putin threatens the Trump Administration with an escalation.When it comes to America’s response in Syria it is imperative Assad pay a big price for the barbaric chemical attack.The Senate should confirm Mike #Pompeo. https://t.co/qI84t7pdH6About to speak with @DanaPerino on @FoxNews.

I wish Paul and his family much happiness and best of luck on all his future endeavors.@SpeakerRyan As Speaker, he delivered to the American people a once-in-a-generation tax reform bill that will pay dividends in the decades to come.  

He is a young, smart, capable man who still has a bright future ahead of him.I’m very disappointed to hear that @SpeakerRyan will be retiring at the end of this term.  

Paul is a good friend and one of the most talented people I have ever met in politics.Will Assad pay a big price?

President Trump must deliver on his threats and big price should include destruction of air power and intelligence operations, and making Assad a target.  

When it comes to Assad’s #Syria, it’s now time to cut off the head of the snake.My statement on today’s hearing on #Facebook. https://t.co/gVNRJs4JFiI’m grateful for @HUDgov @SecretaryCarson &amp; @HUDDepSec Patenaude’s support for large CDBG-Disaster Relief grants for South Carolina.

Tune In!Former Justice Stevens’ push to repeal the #SecondAmendment is a nightmare for the Democratic Party.

Will the mainstream media ask Dem elected officials if they agree? https://t.co/Oc2971kI7BIf there ever was a homerun pick, Admiral Jackson fits the bill – combat surgeon, career military officer who loves his country and will provide the highest quality health care and services to our wonderful veterans.President Trump’s selection of Admiral Jackson to be the new VA Secretary is great news for the American veteran.@TheDemocrats The question isn’t whether they:

•CAN REPEAL (have the votes);

But whether they:

•SUPPORT REPEAL (is 2A outdated/outlived its usefulness).Former Justice Stevens’ push to repeal the #SecondAmendment  is a nightmare for @TheDemocrats Party.

Will the mainstream media ask Dem elected officials if they agree? https://t.co/NVSl65Etf8I think every Democrat Member of Congress should be asked — Do you support former Justice Stevens in repealing the #SecondAmendment? https://t.co/dfRscjll6GSpeaking with @FoxNews @marthamaccallum now.

In fact, statements like this epitomize out-of-touch liberals who do not appreciate the important role the Second Amendment has played – and continues to play – in our nation.I will PROTECT the #SecondAmendment ......not REPEAL it.

Like every American, Justice Stevens is entitled to his opinion, but I am very glad he is now retired.

We discussed Ambassador John Bolton, Russia, #TaylorForceAct, and more.Speaking with @FoxNews @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00 am about Russia, John Bolton, #TaylorForceAct and more.

Tune in.It’s a despicable practice.  And we have now taken corrective steps to bring the practice to an end.

#TaylorForceActTaylor Force was an American hero who was brutally murdered at the hands of terrorists in Israel.  Yet instead of condemning this horrific attack – and so many others like it – the Palestinian Authority actually pays terrorists and their surviving family members.After two years of hard work, the #TaylorForceAct is now the law of the land.I truly appreciate the hard work of the Force family and the many friends of Taylor Force who made it clear to Congress the practice of #PaytoSlay must be stopped.

#TaylorForceAct https://t.co/s2cPXHjrKfPresident @realDonaldTrump's selection of John Bolton as National Security Adviser is:

Good news for America’s allies. 

Bad news for America’s enemies.

He is one of the great national security minds of our time and a terrific patriot! https://t.co/SyzbxYhsOP@AmbJohnBolton’s selection as National Security Adviser is good news for America’s allies and bad news for America’s enemies. https://t.co/SyzbxYhsOPI’m very pleased and supportive of President @realDonaldTrump efforts to push back against China’s intellectual property theft, dumping, and other unfair trade practices.

STREAM: https://t.co/Qf6yNu4YbpPassage of the #TaylorForceAct will give us much needed leverage with the Palestinians to push back on this outrageous policy. https://t.co/3ms3pDDPq0Statement on the #TaylorForceAct being included in the spending bill. https://t.co/fJqHNK1k9LI truly appreciate the hard work of the Force family and the many friends of Taylor Force who made it clear to Congress that this practice — #PaytoSlay — must be stopped.These rewards for terrorist attacks are inconsistent with American values. 

They are inconsistent with decency, and they are certainly inconsistent with peace.

#TaylorForceActTaylor was an American hero who was brutally murdered at the hands of terrorists.  

Yet instead of condemning this horrific attack – and so many others like it – the Palestinian Authority pays monetary rewards to terrorists and their families.After over two years of very hard work, we are on the verge of having the #TaylorForceAct Act become law.

This is one of the most significant pieces of legislation I’ve been involved with.Very pleased the #TaylorForceAct —  which ends American taxpayer dollars going to the Palestinian Authority if they do not stop paying monetary rewards to terrorists and their surviving family members — is set to pass Congress this week as part of the government funding bill.
