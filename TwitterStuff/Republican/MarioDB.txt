You can read more information on the funding in this bill here: https://t.co/Lm3XWKTqIQI am pleased with the work we have done to upgrade our nation‚Äôs infrastructure, and am humbled that my Subcommittee Chairmanship affords me the unique opportunity to help our nation and our local community. #SFLHousing for the elderly is funded at $632M, vouchers for disabled citizens is funded at $390M, and housing assistance for those living with HIV/AIDS is funded at $393M. I am confident we are helping those with the most need in this legislation.Also included is $1.2 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which leverages this funding with private investments to create more affordable housing options.Expanding access to affordable #housing is also emphasized in this legislation. CDBG grants are funded at $3.3 billion dollars, providing localities with the opportunity to apply for grants that address community development, poverty, and other infrastructure needs.With this bill, our local community is empowered to revitalize the roads, bridges, buses, and rail lines we use every day.Our local #airports can pull from $500M provided to Airport Grants, our community will receive needed funds from $4.25B provided for Highway Grants, + our bus&amp;rail systems can benefit from $2.6B provided for Cap Investment Grants or $800 million for transit infrastructure grantsIn turn, this will create jobs across the country and locally, and will lead to a boost in our economy. Right here in #SFL, localities can compete for the $750 million provided to the multimodal BUILD program for new infrastructure projects.For the second year in a row, I have worked to protect hard-earned taxpayer dollars and reduce waste and abuse, while providing historic funding levels to improve our airports, roads, bridges, and seaports.Just now, I introduced the @HouseAppropsGOP #Transportation and #Housing bill for FY19.

Tune in! https://t.co/K5rxLFITKgPraying for Mrs. Bush and her family. Mrs. Bush is a strong woman of faith, and I wish her comfort and peace. https://t.co/AQMeqCGF9jI look forward to continue working with @POTUS, @VP, and my congressional colleagues to provide more opportunities for American families across the country.I was honored to welcome @POTUS to #Hialeah this afternoon to continue the conversation on tax reform and discuss the impact it has had thus far with local business owners.Lower taxes and a simplified tax code are also helping individuals and families, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.More than 4 million workers (and counting) are seeing wage increases, obtaining bonuses, and receiving other employee investments; companies small and large are passing on the benefits of the bill to their workforce.Since the passage of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct in December, we have seen the positive impact #taxreform has had on our economy. At 4.1%, the unemployment rate continues to drop as employers are able to create more jobs, expanding opportunities to more Americans.Doral's @BiscayneBayBrew owner Jose Maella tells @POTUS that his small craft beer brewery was able to purchase $100k in new equipment, increasing their production by 40%, and adding jobs. #TaxCutsandJobsActIrina Vilari√±o, owner of Las Vegas Cuban Cuisine, says that in the short time since the passage of #TaxCutsandJobsAct, her hourly employees have seen an average of 20% in wage increases. #FL25"#TaxCutsandJobsAct has allowed many hardworking people, including many here in #Hialeah to keep more of their paychecks." -@MarioDB.@POTUS' support for a free #Cuba and a free #Venezuela is so important to our community. #FL25Doral-based Sunshine Gasoline Distributors President Max Alvarez thanks @POTUS for #taxreform.

He is a good man, loving husband, and devoted father, and I am lucky to count him among my friends.I am forever grateful for his guidance on the Budget Committee when I was first elected to Congress, but most importantly, that he was courageous enough to take on fixing our broken immigration system with me when others would not..@SpeakerRyan has dutifully served our Congress and the American people as Speaker of the House.  But for me he is much more than just our Speaker; he is a dear friend.  We both come from very different backgrounds, but we formed a bond and friendship that went beyond our work.I commend the Trump administration for standing with Cuba‚Äôs true leadership, the brave pro-democracy activists, in demanding that civil society leaders be permitted to attend #SummitPeru despite Castro regime‚Äôs attempts to silence them.Thanks to @ndn for highlighting Gloria's leadership, passion, and kindness. We are fortunate to have her in our community #SWFL https://t.co/s7IkXZcHiWThanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, #FL25 based company @RyderSystemInc awarded over $23 million bonuses to all non-incentive eligible employees.
