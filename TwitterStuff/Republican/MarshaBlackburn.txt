https://t.co/zBjabRrAaM https://t.co/Jbnx42KSYjThank you, President @realDonaldTrump, for taking action to undo the disastrous effects of #Obamacare on #SmallBusinesses.

Whether Big Tech is censoring conservatives in “flyover country,” referring to California Republicans as Nazis, or stifling fellow competitors, it must end. See my op-ed below.

For our children &amp; grandchildren's sake, we must find more ways to grow &amp; cut our way out of this crisis. That's why I propose a 1% across-the-board spending cut.

https://t.co/fgpWvHlWJbBig Tech companies pretend to care about privacy, but the truth is, they have been selling the privacy of Tennesseans' to the highest bidder for years.

For this reason, we have to have a leader who understands the needs of our veterans, &amp; can give them the best care possible. We look forward to Ronnie Jackson's tenure as Secretary of Veteran's Affairs.Our veterans make the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. They put their life on the line so we, here at home, can be safe. As Americans, we are constantly reminded that freedom isn't free, and it is our service men and women who make us the best nation on earth.Mark 'Universal Income' Zuckerberg has made billions of dollars by selling your information.

We thank Secretary Tillerson for his service and wish him well.Mike and I worked together for several years in the House and on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I know him to be a man of integrity.   He did a tremendous job protecting our country from foreign threats as Director of the CIA.These numbers speak for themselves. This is what happens when you have a businessman in the White House, and Republicans in Congress dedicated to cutting taxes and lifting regulations.

I am tired of reading about our brave men and women dying in training exercises.The military is the backbone of our great nation and the blanket of security under which we rest.  I will always stand with our troops.  Always.  They have been let down, and the American people have been let down. Our leaders have to do better.The fact that lawmakers would cast this aside in order to fulfill their own political narrative is baffling and shameful.Their family and friends risk losing a loved one, but know the dignity of their decision. These brave young men and women are extraordinary, and their selflessness deserves our total reverence and respect.  Period.When our service men and women volunteer to defend this country, they put their lives on the line each and every day for our freedom. They make the ultimate sacrifice, because they know the magnitude of their decision and the honor in their choice.Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the Democrats have proven once again that they care more about illegal aliens than they care about our military and healthcare recipients. The Pelosi/Schumer shutdown is disgraceful. They should be ashamed of themselves.Enough is enough. It's time for my colleagues in the Senate to stop playing political games and do their job.Out of fairness, out of respect, and out of loyalty for those who put on the United States uniform and defend this country, I voted today to fund our military and support their efforts. https://t.co/zP1D6jILhvAbout to host a tele-town hall.

Watch to find out: https://t.co/uAg1oMho5gChairing the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology Hearing on "Closing the Digital Divide: Broadband Infrastructure Solutions." We can't have a first world economy with a third world internet.

There is no dispute- unborn babies can feel pain at 20 weeks. Only 7 countries in the world allow abortion this late in pregnancy, the US shouldn't be one of them.I support trade policies that strengthen American manufacturing, but I am disappointed in the overly harsh ruling of Section 201 tariff remedies that affect imports of residential washing machines.

Make sure to tune in!It's time to make that memo public. https://t.co/iv0MIiE8oEThis group prefers cheap foreign workers over Main Street Americans.No coincidence that on the one-year anniversary of @realDonaldTrump's  inauguration, Schumer and the Dems deliberately shutdown our government. Their move is nothing more than an attempt to score points with their “open borders” radical base &amp; their Silicon Valley donor class.Less regulation + less taxation + less litigation = job growth and innovation. 

https://t.co/B5foVl2nT2This shutdown could have been avoided. Here's why: https://t.co/41kYDgp1trMany of my constituents called today to ask what is going down with the government shutdown. The House did it's job. It's time for the Senate to get on board. The American people deserve better. https://t.co/ULw9tEO9nbHere's the letter: https://t.co/jMVL6wZO2PIf the military doesn't get paid during the shutdown, members of Congress shouldn't either. I wrote a letter to withhold my paycheck. https://t.co/YyVXEVJfbDWhat are the Senate Democrats saying no to? They're saying no to six years of children's health care funding. They are saying no to funding our military and our security forces. It's #shutdownsaturday, but we're here, and we're working. And we're waiting on the Senate. https://t.co/TxyyZhkAxoThey have let their constituents, and all Americans down.Democrats have also shown they have no desire to protect our nation's borders and provide security for Americans. Bc they wouldn't come to the table for a simple compromise they have put the lives of our children and our seniors in danger. Shame on them for their selfish behaviorI am so disappointed that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate thought it was better to play political games than fund our military. Our men and women in uniform, who sacrifice so much for our safety, deserve more than this total disregard for their service.We took a big step forward today to protect the lives of the unborn. https://t.co/WG1BFK1alwOur government must have accountability and transparency in every area.

We must fight to protect the lives of the unborn, and bring judicial action where it's neededIf the Democrats really cared about the Dreamers, they would have come to the negotiation table. I am disappointed that the Democrats chose to let both the Dreamers, and their constituents down.  Political games should not be played when the stakes are so high.Tonight, I voted to fund our troops, our seniors, and our children. The Democrats have proven once again, they will put the lives of millions of Americans, and their livelihoods, all at risk to fulfill their own political agenda. Republicans were very clear what they wanted.Tonight, the House will vote to keep the government open. https://t.co/npnh1whw0vThe Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act will ensure that doctors do everything they can to save the life of a baby who survives an abortion. https://t.co/jI1778GkKvAt the Subcommittee on Environment Hearing on "Modernizing the Superfund Cleanup Program."

Period. https://t.co/rZB7iKQUNWHonored to sponsor the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which the House will pass during the #MarchforLife. Babies born during a failed abortion must receive the same medical care as babies born any other way – it’s that simple.  Watch my interview with @EWTN https://t.co/2KE1uRNnX6President Obama overstepped his constitutional authority by enacting DACA through an executive order. DACA was never a law passed by Congress. https://t.co/F13hnWawBAIf the Democrats do not come to the negotiation table, then there will be no DACA deal. Tune into @RiskRewardFBN to hear why passing funding for the border wall, ending chain migration, and ending the visa lottery system absolutely must be passed first. https://t.co/qdXdx1KeQLRemember when the IRS targeted conservative groups under the leadership of Lois Lerner? It looks like Silicon Valley may be taking a page out of her book. https://t.co/tKaQ4Pn1j7We are so pleased @realDonaldTrump signed those two executive orders for broadband expansion. This is something I have been working for years on with many county officials, mayors, and community leaders. It's imperative rural areas have internet access. 

https://t.co/GzZHCoPqD9It's really very simple. If the Democrats want a DACA deal, it's time to negotiate. https://t.co/GEyan9mRa4The heavy-handed regulations on the internet imposed in 2015 hurt innovation, decreased broadband investment, and only served to bolster Big Tech special interests in Silicon Valley that pose a threat to online free speech.

Thank you @realDonaldTrump for taking action on such an imperative issue for farmers and their businesses, by signing 2 executive orders for rural broadband access. Our internet standards are unacceptable. It's time for changeI agree with @realDonaldTrump- years of crippling regulations, crushing taxes, and corrupt politicians hurt our economy, and hurt our farmers and ranchers.

Nobody is above the law, and putting America's foreign policy up for sale to the highest bidder is absolutely unacceptable. https://t.co/IUgeTVyP3cGreat meeting and terrific TN lunch with Mayors and law enforcement officials today in Waverly. https://t.co/7jpsnHC1PgThe economy is finally on the upswing after years of being suffocated by Obama-era regulations.  Today the Dow crossed 25,000 and we added 250k jobs in Dec. This is what happens when you get government out of the way and let the private sector do its job.
https://t.co/XYtcxBYib3Washington has a spending problem. We need to send some government programs, like Medicaid, back to the states. Tennessee's elected officials know what Tennesseans need more than the federal government does. 
https://t.co/lQPejhIvJMAmerica’s timid response to the '09 Iranian Green Movement was a mistake. Iran is censoring and killing protestors once again. The awful Obama nuclear deal has only emboldened this oppressive regime. We stand for freedom. Thank you for your leadership @nikkihaley @realdonaldtrumpLet's secure that southern border, and let's end illegal entry. https://t.co/cR3H6KOBpyThe Iranian regime is no friend of freedom and we made a terrible nuclear deal with them.  Brave protestors are once again shining a light on Iran’s brutality.  Thank you @realdonaldtrump for standing with them in their quest for freedom.It's time for Washington to get back to work. It's a new year, and 2018 is going to be a busy one. Here's a little preview of what we have planned: https://t.co/1P5zI9t6bP@Prestonjames01 from @NBCTheVoice was the opening act at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville, and he was incredible. I wish everyone the best wishes for this new year. https://t.co/B8IFZzRJgmHappy New Year from Nashville! https://t.co/O0ipGlHx0TWe must focus on closing the digital divide and rural broadband expansion. I look forward to working with @realDonaldTrump on this in an infrastructure bill.About to join @trish_regan on @MorningsMaria to discuss entitlement reform. Make sure to tune in!So many Tennesseans know people who were involved with Tea Party organizations, and saw what they had to go through with the IRS. Government institutions cannot be used as a political weapon. We need accountability and transparency. https://t.co/2ZSDdDnOTRWe've cut taxes and rolled back burdensome regulations. The economy is energized, and we're just getting started. https://t.co/RAc8T7Ix4uWe must fight waste, fraud, and abuse in Washington. It's time to end D.C.'s spending problem.Washington has a spending problem. It's time Congress tackles our deficit, and finally balances the budget. Watch me this morning on @AmericaNewsroom discussing why it's so important we stop reckless government spending.@realDonaldTrump had a clear campaign agenda, and the American people made their choice. As @POTUS, he is keeping those promises. https://t.co/zJoz6R3LSpCatch me on @FoxBusiness at 4pm discussing @realDonaldTrump's accomplishments during his first year as president.My constituents do not want the @FBI to be a political agency. We need accountability and transparency. https://t.co/dxYLN2tHpOMy constituents want to see leadership from Washington, and they want it to be fair and open. https://t.co/858GVHCjWZI wish you and your families a very Merry Christmas. As we celebrate the birth of Jesus, we have so much to be thankful for. I want to say a special Merry Christmas to our service men &amp; women who can't be w/ their families this holiday season. We are thinking of you- thank you.The stockings are hung, and Santa is on his way. Merry Christmas Eve to you all. https://t.co/4OC2S4DexS@realDonaldTrump signed the #TaxCutAndJobsAct into law. This means you get to keep more of your hard earned money, and you're going to see the economy grow. The Obamacare individual mandate is now gone. Too many Tennesseans were forced to buy health insurance they didn't want.There have been a lot of questions about why the Open Internet Preservation Act doesn't address paid prioritization. Let me tell you why: https://t.co/ojkK3n4wA8The House passed the CR, but it's time for Congress to tackle out of control spending, and balance the budget. https://t.co/TH0NaIM9WoThe American people deserve answers. We compiled a report on the Clinton Foundation, and how it may have been used as a charitable facade. I implore AG Sessions to investigate whether it put America's foreign policy up for sale. https://t.co/Rbtws7McgvThe bias against Israel within the United Nations is astounding. https://t.co/iZfAkhTam3No American is above the law, and no American should get preferential treatment. I hope that AG Sessions conducts a thorough investigation into the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One Deal. From our oversight work, we saw there may be some serious pay-to-play.Ready to join @ShannonBream on @FoxNews to discuss chain migration, and the investigation into @PPact. Tune in! https://t.co/1K1FUQv9vTWhen talking to my constituents about the sale of baby body parts, they couldn't believe that something like that would happen in the 21st century. It is sickening. I spoke with @EWTN about the work by the Select Investigative Panel, and the subsequent investigation into @PPact. https://t.co/10q8qzhPJsWe're headed to the @WhiteHouse, with a Christmas present for the American people. https://t.co/Z8JjTZC0Y8I am so grateful to discuss how our Select Investigative Panel onInfant Lives' work prompted the @TheJusticeDept and the @FBI to finally look into @PPact selling fetal tissue. https://t.co/Vldz8gDkGlIt's been a great year, and really, it all started here when @realDonaldTrump was sworn in as our 45th president. Watch our year in review video on our Facebook page to see the highlights: https://t.co/0HlEoC1DwMAfter 31 years, tax reform is finally headed to @realDonaldTrump's desk. This reform will take the Obamacare individual mandate off of the books, and I look forward to passing my legislation to sell health insurance across state lines. It is a great day for the @GOPTax reform update: https://t.co/PXxMGvRA21The American people have been misled about what it truly means, and how net neutrality affects them. It was government controlled internet-not a free and fair internet. 
https://t.co/vDbx80t7eyI'll be on @LocalMemphis, @WKRN, and @6News discussing #TaxCutAndJobsAct. This bill will provide much needed tax relief for all Americans. Let's get it to @realDonaldTrump's desk by Christmas. https://t.co/b9tkBEXLa1Ready to join @kimguilfoyle on @seanhannity's show to discuss why we need to pass tax reform. It's time for us to get back to our core American values- less taxes, more personal freedom. The government is not entitled to your paycheck. https://t.co/jiBZgTRWUBSad that some will lie when the truth will do, and the truth is middle class America gets a tax cut even if the left doesn't like it. https://t.co/1hkjMVCR5HComing up on @FoxBusiness to discuss how tax reform will lead to much needed economic growth. Make sure to tune in! https://t.co/FNSSqji70UNo blocking. No throttling. The Open Internet Preservation Act will ensure the internet is a free and open space. This legislation is simple, it provides light-touch regulation so companies can invest and innovate, and make sure our internet is up to 21st century standards.It's taken 31 years, but the time is finally here. I'm on my way to vote yes for #taxreform. This bill will give much needed tax relief to hardworking families, and allow small businesses to once again thrive. The government isn't entitled to your hard-earned dollars. https://t.co/tVZf1a35vr@AjitPaiFCC has done his job, now it's up to Congress to do theirs. This bill will ensure there is no blocking, no throttling. It is my honor to sign this bill- let's get it to @realDonaldTrump's desk. https://t.co/jOf0fvFwcdIt's time to get government off of our back and out of your pocketbook. #TaxCutTuesday https://t.co/X7bDCk6FaVThe stock market continues to close at record highs, and unemployment is at a 17 year low. Now, it's time for Congress to do its job, and send #TaxReform to @realDonaldTrump's desk.We need to ensure that the internet cannot block or throttle users. This comes from light-touch regulations from Congress, not unelected bureaucrats. https://t.co/Bzr0jstvsGObamacare-era "net neutrality" is nothing more than a code word for government takeover of the internet. These regulations stifled internet investment and growth, and gave tech companies a free pass to censor users and block free speech.There's been a lot of confusion around the term "net neutrality." People have been led to believe the Obama-era rules mean a free and open internet for users. This is simply not true. https://t.co/D1RKpAE1DSTomorrow is #taxtuesday. It's time we pass the #TaxCutsandJobsAct so Americans can keep more of their hard-earned paycheck, and not have to hand it over to the federal government. https://t.co/Iu0v8qqXNYLet's get the #TaxCutsandJobsAct over the finish line and to President @realDonaldTrump's desk. https://t.co/3RMJwWTOBhWe have reached a tipping point. Women have had it with being diminished, condescended to, passed over, and belittled. The time is now to make a change. https://t.co/BM4jkxLjsdWomen's voices are not only valued in the workplace, they're needed. The Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act will ensure that when women step forward with a complaint, there will be accountability and transparency. It's time we make a culture change. @OANN https://t.co/TK7OWujm16Happy #BillofRights Day! On this day we remember the tremendous foresight of our Founding Fathers in ensuring that above all, the rights of the individual should be protected. The original 10 amendments to the Constitution remind us that as Americans, we have a core value-freedomThe internet needs light-touch regulation so you are guaranteed fair and free access. Obama-era net neutrality rules hurt investment and innovation. We need our internet across the country to be up to 21st century standards. 
 
https://t.co/5LSgOS4X9FWatch my interview tonight on @WKRN about #NetNeutralty https://t.co/TnNBAVt9y3These regulations hurt broadband expansion (which is your ability to get a provider), and network investment (which helps companies innovate so you can have faster internet). We need to permanently enact rules that prevent throttling and blocking- but that's Congress' job.Could you get online before Obama's net neutrality regulations? The internet was not broken, and did not need the federal government to enforce overbearing regulations to "fix" it.Here's a weekly roundup of what I did this week in D.C. https://t.co/UL6yF6JiZYWe're for a free and open internet. It's time for Congress to do its job. https://t.co/aflBAaiOkqThere's a lot of confusion about tomorrow's FCC vote to restore internet freedom. Watch this interview to find out why I fully support @AjitPaiFCC- we need a free and open internet. https://t.co/lXjHBR4EQZOur goal is for everyone to get some tax relief, and to make certain the economy will grow. Watch my interview with @KennedyNation, where we discuss marginal tax rates, and how tax cuts will help small businesses. https://t.co/N6lE9rKL9wComing up next on @BloombergTV to discuss #netneutrality. Make sure to tune in! https://t.co/h0WbQ8g828Happy Holidays to our heroes! Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart to our service members, veterans, and their families. Your sacrifice for our country is immeasurable, and the reason that we can live free. https://t.co/iSSv2VgOMIHeaded to the @HouseCommerce #subhealth hearing on the drug supply chain. From the beginning of research until you pick up your medicine at the pharmacy, we want to make sure you have access and get the best value. https://t.co/aIHAdi1AnUObamacare is unaffordable, and being forced to buy it is an infringement on your liberty and freedom. We must repeal the individual mandate in the tax bill. Here are three numbers that will shock you: https://t.co/SlnkIvM3jEObama's EPA rushed harmful &amp; unrealistic fuel economy standards out the door days before leaving presidency. These regs compromise choice, safety, &amp; affordability- raising average price of a car by over $3k. We need realistic standards that don't hurt auto industry or consumers https://t.co/yH7G024FejObama-era “net neutrality” is nothing more than a fancy phrase for government-controlled internet. We fully support @AjitPaiFCC. https://t.co/xwHxipPOwDWe need to look at the vulnerabilities in our immigration system and take action to fix them. https://t.co/5JCJ1cSoRaThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should keep the Senate's repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate. In TN, health insurance premiums have gone up 176%, and 122,000 people chose to pay the fine because health care is unaffordable. Let's get this off the books. https://t.co/VgKN1jtKouI hope that @EPAScottPruitt and @SecElaineChao will do what is right and reassess the Obama administration's rushed midnight rule on the national program and the unrealistic and harmful 2025 emissions standards.Auto manufacturers in my district constantly tell me that we need realistic fuel economy standards, and we need harmonization of standards. If fuel economy policies force auto manufacturers to produce vehicles that customers do not want or cannot afford to buy, no one wins.Happening now: Joint Subcommittees on Environment &amp; DCCP Hearing "Update on the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Motor Vehicles." https://t.co/4qVapIKqPHThe conference committee is working to make sure tax rates are as low as they can possibly be, so American families can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks instead of giving it to the federal government. https://t.co/i9okaLZ83gAbout to join @BillHemmer to discuss how @realDonaldTrump's immigration policies will help prevent future terrorist attacks. Make sure to tune in! https://t.co/bNkOuquSUDI joined @KennedyNation on @FoxBusiness to discuss tax reform. We saw the numbers that came out last Friday- GDP growth and job growth. But we can do better. Let's get economic growth to 4%, and for this to happen, let's get the #TaxBill to @realDonaldTrump's desk. https://t.co/M7ZC9ytdvGWith any special committee or special counsel, you follow the facts that are unfolding. We need to make sure there is no political bias in our justice system. https://t.co/emLm5PzbJa
