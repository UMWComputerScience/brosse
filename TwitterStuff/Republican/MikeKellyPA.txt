Our entire country is better off because of her grace, patriotism &amp; character.Today the House unanimously passed my bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by @RepStephMurphy, to protect Americans from charity scams that exploit our nation's unparalleled spirit of generosity.

My full speech: https://t.co/fU1MKQQv1P #MAGA https://t.co/iwntwGg80dTonight I'll have the privilege of hearing the #SOTU I've been waiting to hear since I first came to Congress 7 years ago: a celebration of America growing stronger &amp; more prosperous thanks to conservative policies enacted by @POTUS. My full speech: https://t.co/fU1MKQQv1P #MAGA https://t.co/oIGf3i0IzgGlad to catch up with the great Sam Malone of @AM1070TheAnswer before tomorrow night's #SOTU! #MAGA @SamMaloneShow https://t.co/5Ah13sinEUAs co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, I'm proud to help introduce a bipartisan House resolution recognizing &amp; supporting the #WinterOlympics2018 in PyeongChang, #SouthKorea. Read our resolution here: https://t.co/tp8DEqnGCx #GoTeamUSAAn informed citizenry is indispensable to our democratic system. Retweet to declare your support for government transparency! #ReleaseTheMemo https://t.co/8TEB9PShgXFYI — Learn how your paycheck will be bigger starting *next month* thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct: https://t.co/zMjMTNfc4f Lower rates + Larger standard deduction = More take-home pay for you &amp; your family! (On top of the 3 million+ workers already receiving tax cut bonuses!)In addition to the full funding of our military &amp; health insurance for kids, another bonus to the #SchumerShutdown ending: a new delay of Obamacare's unfair Cadillac Tax until 2022! Bipartisan support is only growing for ending this dangerous tax for good! https://t.co/HxanJLrwEURepublicans may have majorities in both houses of Congress, but 60 votes (not 51) are needed to pass a funding bill in the Senate. The #SchumerShutdown will end when Senate Dems support the bipartisan, non-controversial, House-passed bill that @POTUS is ready to sign. @ANHQDC https://t.co/FpgFZNV4D4This evening I spoke on the House floor and called on Senate Democrats to end the #SchumerShutdown. They are putting thousands of non-citizens before millions of American children and troops. It is hypocritical and indefensible. Read my official statement: https://t.co/fTINYFITUm https://t.co/xA29DWsmL7@SenBobCasey That kind of talk may please your base, but you know it's wrong. The House passed a bill w/nothing controversial in it. POTUS is ready to sign it. But because it doesn't include a major far-left demand, Dems like you are abusing Senate rules to block it. #Facts #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/VpMuRy8DoQThanks again to the tens of thousands of citizens who participated in today's historic #MarchforLife in our nation's capital! It was especially wonderful to see so many young people in attendance &amp; so passionately involved! Together we can guarantee a #ProLife future! #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/A2rEmQnUzZ@SenatorShaheen @HouseGOP I think you mean "...for failing to provide essential health care for babies born alive but gasping for breath on the abortion table." THAT's shameful.As we approach a possible #SchumerShutdown, let's not forget when @SenSchumer said "shutting down the government" over immigration reform "would be governmental chaos." VIDEO: https://t.co/alS8HjnoyI For our military &amp; more, let's hope Senate Dems do the right thing. #Hypocrisy https://t.co/ggurcw1XSBA great day in #PA, celebrating good news for the USA! #TaxCutsandJobsAct #MAGA https://t.co/RkyPaQrA31Ahead of tomorrow's historic 45th annual #MarchForLife, I was proud to pay tribute on the House floor to the continuing efforts of the #ProLife movement.
