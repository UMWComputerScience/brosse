I would like to thank the Republicans who stood with me for a balanced budget and showed the taxpayers they care how your money is being spent. https://t.co/GjWZxtlWHvThis vote is a litmus test for conservatives. https://t.co/NaV5jHVHvuOur enormous debt threatens our national security. https://t.co/2HQkRciAnKThe bottom line is whether the debt is threatening our country and it is. It's time for Republicans to step up the plate and vote for what they say they're for: a balanced budget.Spending and waste is out of control. How moronic are we to keep flushing tax payer money down a rathole in Afghanistan? When republicans become the majority there is no conservative party. What I'm asking for today is to cut one penny from every dollar in spending.⚡️ “Senator Rand Paul Introduces His Penny Plan Budget”

https://t.co/1nikzN80LXTo those highlighting my vote for tax cuts: allowing Americans to keep more of their own money is what republicans should be for. Fixing the deficit should come from cutting waste and reducing overall spending, all of which I’m for and have put forward legislation to address.Someone has to say "enough is enough" on waste, spending, and debt. https://t.co/H5EfiKKZxTLet's expand Health Savings Accounts! https://t.co/xO3l4DplFzWe shouldn't tolerate such abuse of taxpayer funds! https://t.co/Jgel4nMv0nMy budget does much of what Republicans say they believe in.

If the government ran a balanced budget we would have a stronger, safer nation. If we want to secure our nation we need to make sure we have a sound economy.Republicans say we are for devolving spending and limited government and yet why won't they vote for a budget that balances? I've put forward a Penny Plan budget that cuts spending by 1%. Couldn't we cut one penny from every dollar? Isn't there enough government waste to cut?The budget that republicans passed last year had entitlement reform. Did they do anything to enact those reforms? No. No one lifted a finger to do anything about entitlement spending. It's a canard.When we have a vote on my balanced budget in a minute we'll see republicans saying oh my we can't cut spending. They're only for spending restraint in theory.Dems and Republicans make an unholy alliance. Republicans get more military spending and dems get more welfare spending. We've got guns and butter everyone gets what they want but the tax payer.There is a point which debt is too cumbersome...We have a national debt of $21 trillion dollars. Currently the debt ceiling has been raised and the government can spend and borrow as much as they want.Right now, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), chairman of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management (FSO) Subcommittee, is speaking on the U.S. Senate floor to urge support for his “Penny Plan” balanced budget: https://t.co/9GEF7frVHpYour Senator should be voting to balance the budget!

No one has read it. Congress is broken... https://t.co/izvJlUEgUMFYI- The 2200+ page, budget-busting Omnibus has been printing for two hours in my office and still isn’t done.Shame, shame. A pox on both Houses - and parties. $1.3 trillion. Busts budget caps. 2200 pages, with just hours to try to read it.I ran for office because I thought the Obama spending and trillion dollar annual deficits were a real problem for our country and now Republicans are doing the same thing. https://t.co/Fdi9riA3YKBut guess what? Congress can’t vote to reject the CLOUD Act, because it just got stuck onto the Omnibus, with no prior legislative action or review. https://t.co/8b6W08goXm“Congress should reject the CLOUD Act because it fails to protect human rights or Americans’ privacy...gives up their constitutional role, and gives far too much power to the attorney general, the secretary of state, the president and foreign governments.” https://t.co/pEv4z88lDYGood hashtag. Also great points.  This is not how your government should be run. https://t.co/eX6IC926FZIt’s a good thing we have Republican control of Congress or the Democrats might bust the budget caps, fund planned parenthood and Obamacare, and sneak gun control without due process into an Omni...wait, what?Proud of these kids at South Oldham High School in Crestwood, Kentucky. https://t.co/DhaIxVLuKgInteresting read in The Atlantic: “I know firsthand how brutal these techniques were—and how counterproductive.” https://t.co/VuEVydkdX5Joining @BillHemmer shortly on @FoxNews to discuss the latest news. Tune in! https://t.co/OsUDaOh9nzA good defense of my friend and ally @SenMikeLee. Ridiculous to say this about him.   https://t.co/My7dn4neLwI strongly disagree with John Brennan on his criticism of President Donald Trump, and I also disagree with Brennan’s support of Gina Haspel, who has been a protégé and acolyte of his. We need to drain the swamp. Brennan and Haspel are part of the problem.Good article from @WillRuger.  “America deserves a new, more realistic foreign policy that will help us avoid the next Iraq.

I urge @SenFeinstein to stand against her nomination too!America is a great beacon of hope to the world. We must model freedom. We should not put advocates of torture in charge of our institutions. We can and must do better to helm the CIA.In what seemed like a miracle, the city of Warsaw lit up like a blinking Christmas tree. These freedom fighters were seeking freedom, freedom FROM torture, not freedom TO torture.When two amateur radio operators risked their lives to illegally launch Radio Solidarity in Poland in 1982, they were unsure how big their movement was, so they asked listenteners to blink their lights if they were listening.Torture is the hallmark of totalitarianismTorture is not who we are as a people. America has always been that shining hope of liberty. People around the world look to America want freedom from torture NOT freedom to torture.Tune in to @CNN and @FaceTheNation this morning to hear more of this discussion. https://t.co/W2xK3X2Ti9Looking forward to joining @jaketapper on @CNN and @margbrennan on @CBSNews tomorrow am.

Yet now he picks for Secretary of State and CIA Director people who embody them, defend them, and, I’m afraid, will repeat them. I will not support their nominations.I will continue to support President @realDonaldTrump, but I can’t support people who never understood America First and want to manipulate the President into the sphere of the neocons who never met a war they didn’t want to star in.Director Pompeo has not learned the lessons of regime change and wants regime change in Iran.What I liked about candidate Trump was his strong condemnation of the Iraq War. I believe President Trump has done a great job, and I continue to support him, but I cannot endorse his nomination of people who loved the Iraq War so much that they want an Iran War next.Senator Paul Press Conference on Secretary of State and CIA Nominations https://t.co/kQmxft8YI6Sen.

https://t.co/TbXC8XjaWIMake no mistake, I will always stand up for fiscal responsibility, regardless of which party is in power, and I will continue to call the Republican Party home to the ideas that led to Americans trusting us with government in the first place.Tonight, you could feel the frustration and embarrassment growing in Congress as we exposed the hypocrisy of Republicans who are joining in an unholy alliance and spending free-for-all with Democrats at the expense of the American people and our party’s supposed principles.This debate could have been shortened and could have been finished by noon today had we been granted 15 minutes to have one amendment.Are we to be conservative all the time, or only when we're in the minority? Now some will say, "We must govern." My question about governing is, does governing mean abandoning one's principles?Yes, I want a strong national defense. I believe it's actually the most important thing the federal government does. But you have to ask yourself whether a $20 trillion debt makes us a stronger country or a weaker country.I'm asking for one amendment.  It takes fifteen minutes.Yes, we should have debate.  Yes, we should have a vote. Let's have a vote tonight on amendments.They say, "It's a binary choice, young man. Take it or leave it."

Congress is supposed to take a close look at 12 appropriations bills funding specific areas of government and debate and amend them.I often tell people, “I don’t want to shut down the government, but I’m not sure I want to keep it open unless we reform it.”

If we are going to keep it open and continue to borrow a million dollars per minute, then maybe it’s time to have a real debate about deficit spending.Today I am chairing a hearing entitled: "Terrible, No Good, Very Bad Ways of Funding Government."
