Enforcement + Compassion is what I support.@EricDahlinger Very persuasive!@AngryNIdaho @BetterIdaho That’s not true but keep telling yourself that.@BetterIdaho 60 votes needed in the Senate, but you knew that. Even the liberal media has corrected Democrats on this point. And I did misspell it, though, so I will correct it. #SchumerShutdown@FCodeley @TheJohnsonPost @politico I do - so far, no evidence of collusion. But nice try changing the subject.@TheJohnsonPost @politico According to you, a person is only a legislator if they vote according to your wishes. We are willing to deal with the DACA population which many Republicans were unwilling to do just 2 years ago.  We have moved, it’s time your side move as well.@TheJohnsonPost @politico Apparently restating the law makes you a nativist. It’s a simple statement of the law. All people in the United States without documentation accrue unlawful presence from the moment they turn 18.  I know Democrats don’t like the law, but that is the law.@WhipHoyer Schumer offered authorizing, not funding the wall. There was no deal reached. Stop lying to the American people.  #SchumerShutdown@steve_rostron Not really a party issue. Support for the 60 vote rule is strong among the longer serving members of both parties. Seems like the more traditionalist members of both parties want to keep the rule and the less traditionalist members want to change it.@AsshatDrumpf @AngryNIdaho @craighdurham @GOP @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Yes, I would be. I have advocated for it the whole time I have been in Congress, even when Reid was the majority leader.@steve_rostron I have always said this@AngryNIdaho @craighdurham LOL if you think that it wouldn’t be much easier to get 50 votes than 60 votes.@Kluskee @craighdurham Funny - I didn’t call for a partisan solution. I called for a solution that requires 50 votes. It seems that you are calling for partisan solutions. Think about the logical conclusions of your comments before you call people names.@craighdurham 50-49, with McCain not voting and McConnell voting no for procedural reasons. Try doing research before you comment. Google is easy to use.It’s time to change the rules in the Senate (go nuclear) or to force Senators to speak on the floor to sustain a filibuster. The filibuster is not a veto. Senate disfunction must end.  The Constitution does not require 60 votes in the Senate. #makethemspeak https://t.co/qsZ6eTfvKFIt is heartbreaking that America has permitted nearly 60 million abortions since 1973.
