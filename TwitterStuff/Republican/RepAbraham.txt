DOJ should respect the laws of this land &amp; Congress’ Constitutional oversight authority. This has been going on for far too long. The American people deserve answers. It’s time for the DOJ to pony up these documents and comply with these subpoenas #LA05 https://t.co/rd7JtoJcNaGreat hosting our 2018 Art Competition winner Shelby Cumpton from Quitman High. Her dad Keith, an @LAStatePolice trooper, inspired her painting "Thin Blue Line." It will hang in the US Capitol &amp; remind us of the sacrifices our LEOs &amp; their families make for our communities. #LA05 https://t.co/Be8l3w5z2OThe House should focus on winning enough votes to pass the original Goodlatte-McCaul bill that accomplished everything that we as conservatives want: building a border wall, cracking down on sanctuary cities, ending the visa lottery system, and stopping chain migration. #LA05My constituents have been clear: No amnesty for illegal immigrants. My no vote today reflected my commitment to them that I will never support amnesty. The bill included some good things but went too far in granting amnesty for about 2M people who came into this country illegallyI have full confidence that President Trump will select a strong, constitutional conservative to fill the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy. I'm looking forward to seeing who he picks! #LA05On #PTSDAwarenessDay, we recognize the fight continues for many veterans. Congress gave $8.8 billion for veteran mental health, PTSD &amp; suicide prevention, but nothing replaces a loved one's support. Let our heroes know they aren't alone &amp; let's get them the help they need. #LA05 https://t.co/5FU5VCdm8dCongress should censure Maxine Waters for her uncivilized and dangerous call to harass Trump officials. As the new face of the left, her supporters will use her words to justify violence &amp; intimidation to get their way. We can't allow that behavior. #LA05 https://t.co/iBuf92jwW1Great meeting today w/ @Grambling1901 SGA President Adarian Williams, who is interning in DC. We talked about the $2.2 million grant GSU received to help train students for STEM jobs. Thanks for the great discussion! #GramFam #LA05 https://t.co/k2wZcbY9cCThis is a tremendous win for religious liberty and the freedom of speech. California's law directly attacked both by going after these #Prolife pregnancy centers, and the Supreme Court was right to rule in favor of @NIFLA. #NIFLAvBecerra #LA05 https://t.co/VdYCepydVzThe Supreme Court made the right call here. The United States has every right to determine who enters our country, and there is no reason we should open the gates for people without thoroughly vetting them for security threats first. #LA05 https://t.co/qJns7cETnfToday, Congress wrapped up two weeks full of legislation to combat the opioid epidemic, the crisis next door for millions of American communities. The final bill passed was H.R. 6, which is one of the most important bills dedicated to addressing the opioid crisis. https://t.co/V5nEQkRUJpOver the last six months, we’ve seen countless benefits of tax reform.

This bill works better for the farmer and the American people. #LA05 https://t.co/wWvBCsgP14Congratulations to this young man, who grew up back home in #LA05. You make Louisiana and #LSU proud. #GeauxTigers https://t.co/EGNUf1S1KGI'm a proud cosponsor of #SAFA Goodlatte-McCaul bill. It prevented amnesty, funded the wall, ended chain migration &amp; cracked down on sanctuary cities. I'm disappointed it failed today but will continue to work to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system. #LA05Don’t separate the families, but again don’t enter the country illegally either. Stop them at the border, send them back to their country as a family unit. Certainly do not send those children up to our border without their parents accompanying them. #LA05
https://t.co/43dh0JLCObOur farmers are our thin green line - the ability to grow our own food is certainly a national security asset.

https://t.co/GKsjxMHyPIToday is 74th anniversary of American troops landing on the beaches of Normandy. Each year, we remember #DDay and the sacrifices made by so many during World War II. These sacrifices should never be overlooked &amp; that's why I am an advocate in Congress for veterans everywhere. https://t.co/Nw8pjgX8UPI'm glad that Mitch McConnell will cancel the Senate's August recess. Maybe now the other chamber will have time to consider the 471 bills the House has passed that have stalled because of Democrat obstruction. #LA05It was great having the Louisiana Nursing Home Association in the office today.

Thanks to Mayor Adam Holland and Sheriff Jerry Philley for all your hard work in completing this project. #LA05 https://t.co/itRKmZOQHQLast week, Congress passed the #FY19NDAA and gave our military the highest pay raise in nine years.  This was just one of 648 bills that the 115th Congress has passed out of the House this session, making it the most productive Congress of the last four administrations. #LA05 https://t.co/fa5o2hnDZqWe wrapped up Memorial Day with a service at the Ponemah Cemetery in Bogalusa. Today’s services were a reminder of the ultimate sacrifice made by our military to protect our country. Thank you to our servicemen &amp; women everywhere for defending our freedom. https://t.co/7LfoQCOBdDWonderful service today in Alexandria, LA for Memorial Day. It was great to see the LA National Guard Youth Challenge and to speak with veterans from across the state. #LA05 https://t.co/uX9y002MOkOn Memorial Day, we reflect on the men &amp; women who gave their lives for our country. We're forever in their debt &amp; for that reason, I'm committed to serving Gold Star families across the nation. Today we say "Thank You!" to our military for their incredible bravery &amp; sacrifice. https://t.co/MHYQgRprc9Today, I attended the Memorial Day Recognition ceremony in West Monroe &amp; had a chance to meet the West Monroe Honor Guard. This ceremony was a touching tribute to the men &amp; women who’ve given their lives for our country &amp; a great reminder of those who continue to serve every day. https://t.co/fd6p2l52UcVery exciting news for ULM and #LA05! As a doctor myself, I wish all future ULM medical students the very best. https://t.co/sy5RFAFCjDOn Thursday, President Trump signed legislation to repeal burdensome financial regulations. This bill provides much need relief to community banks and credit unions. I was proud to support this bill in Congress and am happy to see it signed into law. https://t.co/Tlhr1EPrZ6Today I attended a service honoring 2nd Lt. Harvel Lee Moore who was killed during World War II. The service was a reminder of the sacrifices our military, and their families, make for our country. As we enjoy the weekend I’ll be thinking of those like 2nd Lt. Moore &amp; his family. https://t.co/Zo6G4C2U5ZThe @AmericanLegion &amp; Congress recognize May 25 as National Poppy Day, where Americans don a red poppy to represent those who sacrificed their lives while protecting our freedom.

It’s always nice to see friendly faces from home. #LA05 https://t.co/puNwtldmuLMy statement on the #2018FarmBill. I was proud to vote for it, and I'm confident we can get it passed. https://t.co/FT0EaT7mZiThe last thing our farmers need is burdensome regulations. The #2018FarmBill streamlines government regulations, eliminates heavy handed federal regulations on our nation’s agricultural community, and builds upon the success of programs already in place. https://t.co/5gFHUH1lr2It’s time we encourage and support young farmers. The #2018Farm Bill funds programs that aids new farmers in acquiring land &amp; credit, accessing crop insurance and supporting education &amp; training. https://t.co/spkBIPIX2qThe #2018FarmBill provides funding for any work capable adult to get job education &amp; training they need. This would bring over 180,000 Louisianans off the sidelines and get them back to work and back on their feet. https://t.co/0gdNtedt6PFood security is national security. The #2018FarmBill brings certainty and stability back to our agricultural community, giving them what they need to continue to put food on America’s tables. https://t.co/a45GOBmT1t#2018FarmBill maintains a commitment to rural America. It addresses the opioid crisis, strengthens rural broadband services &amp; establishes an U.S.-only vaccine bank. Nancy Pelosi is out of touch with rural states- the only interaction she's had is at 35,000 feet in a private jet. https://t.co/WecYQYi6tPWe enjoy the safest, most affordable and most abundant food source in the world, largely due to consistent investments in the agricultural innovation. The #2018FarmBill maintains funding for research, extension &amp; land grant universities &amp; specialty crops and organic research. https://t.co/ExJ4EMH68QDespite Democrats claims, no child, caretaker of a young child, senior citizen or disabled person will lose SNAP benefits. New SNAP reforms ensure assistance for the vulnerable while giving work capable adults an opportunity to improve their life. https://t.co/MywjRplJouThe #2018FarmBill provides real reforms to ensure that farmers keep providing the world with a safe and stable supply of food. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t agree but the only experience she’s had with rural America is flying over it in her private jet. #FlyOverNancy https://t.co/fK4HEFyXjwMueller investigation is like a dog chasing its tail: There's nothing to catch. 1 year &amp; millions of wasted tax $ later, he still has nothing on President Trump. This investigation needs to end. If anything, DOJ should be focusing on rooting out corruption within itself #LA95Very glad we have a @USDA Secretary who really gets it! @SecretarySonny is doing a great job for our farmers. #LA05 https://t.co/0LFA4JsBxsPraying for a speeding recovery for our wonderful @FLOTUS, @MELANIATRUMPDuring #NationalPoliceWeek, we thank our LEOs for keeping our communities safe. #LA05 will celebrate our police officers all year since our Congressional Art Competition winner, Shelby Cumpton, honored her father &amp; state troopers w/ a portrait that will hang in the U.S. Capitol! https://t.co/MTwFy9U8A4President Trump kept his promises by moving the embassy to Israel's rightful capital, Jerusalem. This is a bold, courageous move shows that the US &amp; Israel are repairing the special relationship that was strained under Obama. The world is safer when our countries work together.While SNAP provides an important safety net for many Americans, I want it to be an on-ramp to success, not a lifestyle for work-capable adults. Changes to the SNAP program will help people break out of the cycle of poverty and climb the economic ladder. https://t.co/l9t2RFxJ4NIn their own words, the #2018FarmBill gave @HouseDemocrats what they asked for. This proves their opposition is based entirely on politics. Let's stop playing games and pass a long-term bill that gives our farmers the stability they need to feed this country! #LA05 https://t.co/SLLzNQs8Ng3 American prisoners released from North Korea. If you haven't noticed the incredible diplomatic work taking place on the Korean Peninsula under President Trump's watch, it's because you're choosing not to give him any credit. #LA05 https://t.co/ejdymS77kPPres. Trump made a wise decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran. Iran Deal was not deterrent to nuclear weapon; it was a pathway. The President has always put the security of the US &amp; our allies first and foremost above politics. Another example of solid, positive leadership #LA05I joined the @LaFarmBureau Voice of Louisiana Agriculture podcast to discuss policies in the Farm Bill, including important changes to help #Louisiana commodity producers. #LA05

I hope President Trump tears up the current Iran Deal and renegotiates to find a solution that's better for America and better for Israel.Today, #Louisiana celebrates its 206th birthday! Fun fact: Our state song, "You Are My Sunshine," was written by Gov. Jimmie Davis, who grew up in Jackson Parish right here in #LA05. https://t.co/WRt0josk2TI call our farmers America's "thin green line" because food security is national security.

It is the single most important piece of legislation for our farmers, and I look forward to seeing it become law. My full statement below: #LA05 https://t.co/Zrq5M0IxbYDemocrats want to tank the #2018FarmBill - risking certainty and stability for our farmers - because we're instituting work requirements for SNAP. Work requirements/job training aren't just GOP priorities; they're what an overwhelming amount of Americans are calling for. #LA05 https://t.co/IX27rhuHEPThe #FarmBill is the result of years of work. It will be better for the farmer and better for the American people. Today, we'll pass it out of the @HouseAgNews Committee. Here's a story from @TWILATV about how important this bill is to our young farmers and ranchers. #LA05 https://t.co/2ds8SNZzCLDianne &amp; I join our nation in mourning Barbara Bush, a remarkable lady passionate about making our world better. She always told it like it was &amp; I admired that. She was a role model who showed courage, kindness &amp; humility. She was an American treasure, and we pray for her familyI spoke with @KALBtv5 about how tax reform is working for Americans. This is the last Tax Day under our old, broken system. Next year, 82 percent of middle-income earners are expected to see a tax cut. #LA05 https://t.co/dyTDpUusWUGreat meeting today with @TulaneNews President Mike Pitts.

We'll pass it out of the @HouseAgNews Committee tomorrow.
https://t.co/YibaPOf1QpSteve Scalise is a great leader. Should he run for Speaker, the House will get a strong conservative at the helm, and Louisiana will have a very powerful ally.

I hope her health improves, and I will continue to pray for her and her family.From @TownTalkDotCom about new SNAP work requirements: “It shouldn't become a long-term solution. That may not feel like the most popular choice for politicians seeking votes, but it is what we believe is in the best interest of the people served.” #LA05 https://t.co/sCtTMGqwSbI fully support President Trump’s retaliatory strike. Syria committed atrocities against its own people and the Assad regime must realize that these actions will not go unanswered. I am supremely confident that the US and our allies have made the best decision possible. #LA05No child, senior or mentally/physically disabled person will lose SNAP. Work-capable adults will be expected to work or train for a job, and we guarantee job training for all who want it. Why would Democrats oppose job training and helping people break free of poverty? #LA05 https://t.co/UgTA16y7YzI cosponsored legislation calling for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Unfortunately, it failed to reach the required 2/3 vote to pass. I will continue to support ways to cut waste, fraud and abuse and make government work smarter and more efficiently. #LA05Great meeting today with Marshall Pierite, who was elected chairman of the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana on Sunday. Looking forward to working with you. #LA05 https://t.co/lfUbY0Li7dSNAP is an important safety net for many Americans, but I want it to be an on-ramp to success, not a lifestyle for work-capable adults. The new #FarmBill makes reasonable changes to work requirements so that more adults are ready for the workforce. #LA05 https://t.co/F6bwuoY04vYesterday, I chaired a @HouseScience subcommittee hearing on Chinese spies infiltrating many layers of our society for nefarious reasons.

Republicans should be using our majorities to have an open debate and write these spending bills to reflect our priorities - the military, the border wall, rooting out waste. #la05(2/2) rather than focusing on the money our military and border security need. Dropping a $1.3 trillion spending bill - one that breaks a deal we struck just last month - hours before it needs to pass is an irresponsible way to govern, and that’s why I voted against it.(1/2) This 2,200 page omnibus dropped less than a day before we voted on it, and no one could possibly have read it all in that amount of time. I do know enough to see that it breaks budget compromise we struck last month by tacking on billions in extra spending on pet projects,An honor to accept the @AOPA Hartranft Award with my friend @RepRussell for leadership and advocacy on behalf of general aviation.

Best of all, he kept the focus on the hard-working men &amp; women who make this country special. He spoke from the heart tonight and I liked what I heard. #SOTU2018 #LA05Our military and national security should not be bargaining chips in the immigration debate. Senate Democrats claim they want a stand-alone, long-term funding bill for the military. They have one. Let's see if they put their money where their mouth is. https://t.co/OS4n3SjtnWThe House just voted for a 3rd time for long-term funding for our military. 2 prior tries to give our troops resources to keep us safe were blocked by Senate Democrats.

Washington can come up with some crazy ways to waste time &amp; money, but this pointless shutdown takes the cake.And that’s exactly what she did. House GOP passed funding for government, CHIP and our troops on Thursday. Dems overwhelmingly voted against it. Senate Democrats did the same and shut our government down bc they want amnesty for illegal aliens. https://t.co/FNs6C1atXAOur brave men and women in uniform must continue their mission w/out pay bc Senate Democrats put amnesty for illegal immigrants ahead of paying our troops.

GOP passed a 3-month extension to CHIP in December.
These are facts Dems are conveniently leaving out when discussing CHIP.My prayers are with the family of Deputy Chief Russell Achord of the West Feliciana Fire Protection District who died while responding to a crash on US 61. Our first responders put their lives on the line every day for us, and we owe them so much for keeping our communities safe.As a doctor in rural Louisiana, I have seen how #CHIP helps poor children, but Democrats are playing political games with CHIP over an unrelated immigration debate. Dems care more about illegal immigrants than they do about sick American children. That is unconscionable. #LA05 https://t.co/CU933ptsO0Great to visit with these students, parents and faculty from Opelousas Catholic School who are in Washington for the #Prolife march later this week.
