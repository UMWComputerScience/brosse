My take: https://t.co/aHPOHoLiBlThe Senate votes at noon to reopen the government. Will @SenateDems continue to block funding?  Or will they end their #SchumerShutdown?  I hope they do the right thing.Remember when Democrats were against government shutdowns? We do. Buckle your seatbelt. We're about to take a trip back to 2013 &amp; 2014 so we can hear from Democrats themselves. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/2ZMTyOJSDqIt’s now been 40 hours since the beginning of the #SchumerShutdown. The House has done its job. Now it’s time for @SenateDems &amp; @SenSchumer to do theirs by opening the government and providing resources for our military and children that rely on CHIP. https://t.co/qPh9r6JRM8More than 90,000 Kentucky kids and their families depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program. I urge Senate Democrats to do the right thing. End the #SchumerShutdown, pay our troops, and ensure these children have access to health care. https://t.co/mFL2DYXonPThe clock is ticking on the #SchumerShutdown. How long will Senate Democrats let this go on before joining Republicans on funding for the 9 million children on CHIP and our military? Join the fight - share the #SchumerShutdown clock now. https://t.co/3JgTdoQ7A4How did we get to #schumershutdown? Read this full recap in @thehill: https://t.co/6Fg5uMoiJ5Last night, Senate Democrats made the choice to strip funding from the Children's Health Insurance Program and deny our troops the support they deserve through the #SchumerShutdown. This is reckless, irresponsible, and wrong. https://t.co/3JgTdoQ7A4Reminder: A government shutdown will put national security interests and military readiness at risk. House Republicans voted to keep the government open last night, but @SenateDems are obstructing. Why do they prefer #SchumerShutdown to standing with our troops?Reminder: House Republicans passed a 5-year CHIP reauthorization on November 3, 2017. @SenateDems obstructed. We also passed a 6-year CHIP reauthorization yesterday with government funding. @SenateDems are obstructing. Why do they prefer #SchumerShutdown to healthcare for kids?Reminder: House Republicans passed all 12 appropriations bills for the current fiscal year ahead of schedule - over 5 months ago. The Senate has not passed a single one because 60 votes are required &amp; @SenateDems obstructed. That is why we are now facing #SchumerShutdown.The House passed legislation to keep the government open - so why are we on the brink of a shutdown? Because @SenSchumer is stalling over an artificial DACA deadline. Senate should pass House CR to keep government open and continue DACA/border security talks. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/aJ5HiVVZV0Will @SenSchumer and @SenateDems vote to shut down the government, hurt the military and deny more than 92,000 Kentucky children who depend on CHIP? #SchumerShutdownAfter reviewing the classified report summarizing the findings of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into FISA abuses by the DOJ and the FBI, I am calling on the Committee to release this document as it contains information of significant public interest.Must watch video: More than two million American workers have already benefitted from bonuses, higher wages, and better benefits because of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct – but the critics still have their heads in the sand!
