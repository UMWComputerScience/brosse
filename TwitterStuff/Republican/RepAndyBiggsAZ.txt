Today, I sent a letter to Rep. Maxine Waters, urging her to recant her encouragement of physical harassment as a political tactic, &amp; demanding an apology to the American people. I was joined on the letter by @RepMattGaetz, @RepTedYoho &amp; @TXRandy14. MORE: https://t.co/EM9cIgpnrBIn this episode, we talk about the censure resolution we authored against Rep. Maxine Waters, our fight to obtain transparency fr from the DOJ, and our continued efforts to repeal Obamacare. You're not going to want to miss this half hour. Thanks for joining me, @RepMattGaetz.You've waited all week for this new episode of "What's the BIGGS Idea?" - here it is!

This week, I interviewed @RepMattGaetz, a valued ally in Congress. Matt's a change agent. He supports @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's agenda &amp; he keeps his promises. LISTEN: https://t.co/tFMooEL1BMThank you to the @ABAArizona
for stopping by my D.C. office this week. We had a good conversation about the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and about workforce development. https://t.co/i3jj6fmET8Congratulations, Vice Mayor Lopez! @jrlopezrep https://t.co/yTM4fvoWNwTragic afternoon for this community and the families affected by this senseless act of violence. Cindy and I are praying for the victims and their families. https://t.co/l7iIwRfoe1I look forward to continuing my wholehearted support for our Armed Forces.We will continue to fund the most formidable attack helicopters in the world: Apaches (manufactured in Mesa). We will also fund the National Guard Drug Interdiction Program &amp; Counter-Drug Activities - critical to the AZ National Guard’s efforts to combat illegal drugs &amp; cartels.I was pleased to vote in favor of the 2019 DoD Appropriations Act. This legislation supports our ongoing missions to defeat ISIS, enhances our missile defense capabilities, gives our troops another pay raise &amp; continues to assist w/ military readiness. https://t.co/93lcEl4tZBNOW: I'm questioning DOJ Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray in the @HouseJudiciary Committee. Watch HERE: https://t.co/xjcuafYe3S #AZ05@RepMarkMeadows The DOJ has held this body &amp; its authority in contempt for far too long, &amp; our patience is wearing thin. 

There has not been full compliance with our requests, nor has there been adequate reasons given for non-compliance. 

To the DOJ: turn over the documents immediately.Later this morning, the House will be voting on @RepMarkMeadows' resolution to request that, within seven days, the Department of Justice release the documents Congress has asked for in accordance with our responsibilities of oversight. WATCH: https://t.co/0mBRA9Mf9D #AZ05NOW: I’m on the @HouseFloor, speaking in support of @RepMarkMeadows’ resolution that requests the DOJ to turn over documents Congress needs to conduct proper oversight of our departments and agencies. It’s past time for the DOJ to fully comply. We must have transparency.It was so nice to welcome Angela Kan and her family to the U.S. Capitol today. Angela submitted the winning art piece for the #AZ05 Congressional Art Competition (“Memorial Day”), and she had the opportunity to see it hanging in the Capitol. Congrats again, Angela! https://t.co/toFn9UERoSLet’s put the border wall, e-verify, chain migration, increased Border Patrol agents, &amp; other conservative proposals, into separate bills. Since I have come to Congress, I have yet to see an immigration bill consistent with the promises Republicans made while campaigning.Instead of working on a large comprehensive immigration package behind closed doors and without regular order – we should break up the elements of the legislation, and pass each individually.Today I voted against another attempt to grant amnesty to illegal aliens.

Like last week’s amnesty bill, HR 6136 fails to deliver on promises we made to our constituents to 1st fund, build &amp; complete a border wall before reforming other pieces of our broken immigration system. https://t.co/0jvcPhcgQrNOW: I'm LIVE with @RepMattGaetz on the @seanhannity show, talking about the latest with the DOJ and our efforts to restore civility in our political discourse.

We must show the American people that we can disagree with each other without ill will, and without encouragement to escalate this political vitriol.@marthamaccallum I'm all for commitment and passion to your principles and a healthy debate and discourse about any of the issues our nation faces. Sometimes the discussions won't be fully civil.To actually ask people to harass officials, making sure they don't feel safe simply because they disagree with you on policy-as Rep. Maxine Waters did -that's wrong. This is why I introduced the censure resolution. More of my interview w/ @marthamaccallum https://t.co/XL3QBm43pqGood morning.

The American people expect more from their representatives, and we are determined to obtain the answers we seek.We've learned (little by little) that there were at least THREE individuals in the probe who harbored unhealthy political biases against @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. My colleagues and I aren't so sure these were the only three.This afternoon, I fired off a letter to Rod Rosenstein, joined by eight of my colleagues, requesting the names of everyone - past and present - working on the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation. MORE: https://t.co/0HSk66079h@Varneyco @FoxBusiness @POTUS @realDonaldTrump We have thousands of illegal aliens crossing our border - and those numbers are surging.

Our nation's future depends on it.I just joined @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness to discuss the absolute chaos at our southern border. I understand @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's frustration &amp; share his desire to ensure that the border is secure &amp; to stop the flow of illegal aliens into our country. https://t.co/xRAclf5fCMCOMING UP: I'm about to join @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness to talk about the battle to secure the border and fight amnesty efforts in Congress.

See you soon, Arizona. https://t.co/Z7UBBxx1zE #AZ05@trish_regan @FoxBusiness The bill today did not fully fund and secure the border before anything else AND it included a DACA amnesty. I promised my constituents that I would fight to secure the border and oppose amnesty in any form. That's why I voted no.@trish_regan @FoxBusiness After we secure the border, enforce our laws, and eliminate incentives for aliens to illegally cross into - and stay in - our country, we should take a look at our immigration procedures &amp; process without endangering our principles or granting amnesty to any group over another.After today's immigration vote, I joined @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness to discuss my opposition. I believe that our border should be secured first &amp; foremost. That's what we promised our constituents. And yes, a secure border includes the wall.

As I write for @thehill, by granting DACA amnesty &amp; setting aside our laws, we demonstrate that we no longer value the rule of law – &amp; equality for all – &amp; lay the foundation for further abrogation of our American heritage. 

MORE https://t.co/DWBNoX9lyb #AZ05Here’s to the next six months of continued prosperity for the United States!Passing this bill was the right thing to do - we observe proof of that every day. It’s important that Congress continues to build on the overwhelming success of this law by cutting more taxes, extending the current tax cuts, reducing regulatory burdens, and cutting spending.It’s been six months since Congress passed the historic “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.”

Since that day, Americans have seen countless bonuses, wage increases, and job opportunities - all leading to a tremendous optimism about the direction of our economy. #AZ05 https://t.co/48jlzuVW31@RepMarkMeadows We must ensure that those seeking asylum do so legally &amp; legitimately. I commend Rep.

Last week, @RepDeSantis, @RepMattGaetz &amp; I sent a letter to request drafts. https://t.co/xZu3DBiEzRIt's no wonder the American people have such a severe distrust of our justice system with leaders like Comey, Mueller, Strzok, and others running the show.You have these people at the highest levels of our justice system, who appear to have been inappropriately controlling the inputs that are going into the decision-making process. That indicates that the ultimate output may indeed have been biased.Mr. Horowitz testified that it could have and that "we don't rule it out."

That's a problem - and speaks to our concerns over the past year.Peter Strzok was an integral part of the Clinton email investigation.

A little is better than nothing; however, Congress should never have put itself in this position again by passing the $1.3 trillion omnibus bill.Just a short while ago, the House passed H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act to cut nearly $15 billion in appropriated – but unspent – federal funds. https://t.co/AjBaqQjGHmNOW: I’m joining @thechrisbuskirk on @960ThePatriot.

Thankfully, all three of these individuals appear to be in good health.THE THREE AMERICANS FROM NORTH KOREA ARE COMING HOME!

This latest good news from North Korea is a testament to @POTUS @realDonaldTrump’s persistence and a very encouraging development in the lead-up to further negotiations with Kim Jong-Un. https://t.co/FFu8F9aqOqWATCH: I'm about to join @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness from Stat Hall to discuss the top news of the week: Three Americans on their way home from North Korea!

This is an epidemic that we take extremely seriously &amp; I’m looking for sensible, effective solutions to help individuals who need it most. Thanks to our witnesses. #AZ05 https://t.co/PHSyego2tV@LouDobbs @FoxBusiness This is the type of corruption that absolutely has to go, and I'm working around the clock to give the American people the answers they deserve.@LouDobbs @FoxBusiness You &amp; I, if we were lectured by a judge the way that Judge Ellis did, we'd probably reassess our actions &amp; make course corrections. I just don't think that's going to happen w/ the Mueller probe. I think they know already that they're beyond their scope &amp; abusing their power.I had the opportunity last night to talk with @LouDobbs on @FoxBusiness about Robert Mueller's continued abuse of power and Judge Ellis's spot-on comments last week to the Mueller team in court.

1st place winner of the 2018 Congressional Art Competition goes to Angela Kan, for her piece "Memorial Day." Congrats, Angela! #AZ05 https://t.co/Kqkl91C7uoThis week, our D.C. office welcomed the Mortensen &amp; Ward families to our Nation's Capital for tours. It's nearing the end of the school year back home, which means that it's time for more Capitol tours. Make sure you contact my office for a tour if planning on visiting. #AZ05 https://t.co/ZDgTCarUhXICYMI - Last night, news broke that FBI attorney Lisa Page resigned.

Today, we look at protecting ranchers from the Mexican grey wolf.

It’s time we restore some sanity to the system by balancing Mexican gray wolf protections with farmers and ranchers’ right to protect their lands.

It's time to shed transparency on his intentions and timeline for the remainder of his flawed investigation.Judge T.S. Ellis III might be on the verge of bringing lawful accountability to Robert Mueller's witch hunt against @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. This is welcome news. https://t.co/TcuCipSe8E #AZ05@POTUS @realDonaldTrump We need to continue to support @POTUS @realDonaldTrump in his efforts to reduce regulatory regulations and to permanently extend the tax cuts we enacted with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year in order to strengthen our country's economic prosperity.Great news today for the U.S. economy -the nation's unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level since 2000. This is another clear signal that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's policies are having a dramatic (&amp; positive) effect on everyday life in America. https://t.co/No5TtYzGuG #AZ05Yesterday, I met with @MesaFireDept Chief Mary Cameli to discuss her department’s innovative approach to ensure that Mesa’s residents receive the highest level of care possible. My staff and I are very thankful for our first responders and their service to our communities. #AZ05 https://t.co/a8QgulHOOLGreat article on @azcentral about a small business owner in Mesa. Amber Miller probably never predicted her future success, but she knew she had to try. That's the story for countless #SmallBiz owners &amp; why their courage is vital for the American economy. https://t.co/kB1THfdxiB@SandraSmithFox @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews I understand exactly why @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is so outraged certain leaders at the DOJ, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to demand and extract the transparency that our constituents deserve. WATCH the full interview: https://t.co/ROST9VHpjb #AZ05I joined @SandraSmithFox on @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews this morning to discuss the latest developments at the DOJ. Rod Rosenstein has failed to oversee the scope of the Special Counsel AND failed to respond repeatedly to Congressional oversight for his department.My father-in-law, a World War II veteran, had the honor of meeting @VP Mike Pence yesterday at his AZ event. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &amp; VP Pence have a tremendous respect for our Armed Forces &amp; our veterans. Just another reason why my family is thankful for this administration. https://t.co/ri0W5aBuAiCOMING UP: I'm on @IngrahamAngle at the top of the hour. Tune into @FoxNews NOW. #AZ05TONIGHT: I'll be joining @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews to discuss our response to Rosenstein's refusal to recognize Congress's constitutional oversight of the Department of Justice.

We can’t have two sets of justice any longer.The American people are tired of watching the Department of Justice undermine Congressional oversight into questions where there appears to be internal corruption for political purposes to control the 2016 Presidential election.I'll be talking with @toddstarnes on @foxnewsradio at the top of the next hour about the latest at the Department of Justice. Hope you'll listen to the discussion. #AZ05As we continue to celebrate #SmallBusinessWeek, let's recognize all the women who have had the courage to start and run their own small businesses.

Great event today. #AZ05 https://t.co/EpKzlabqJxI'm about to head out to @VP's tax cuts event, but first joining @HARRISFAULKNER on @FoxNews @OutnumberedOT to talk about the leaked Mueller questions for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. Hope you'll be able to tune in. #AZ05.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump' administration is extremely receptive to the needs of our #SmallBusinessOwners. I'm continuing to work with my colleagues and the @WhiteHouse to reduce regulations and continue to make the tax code work for them.This week, we continue to recognize our small businesses across the U.S. The men &amp; women who start &amp; run these businesses are exceptional job creators, managers, &amp; entrepreneurs. They ask for the freedoms to run their businesses according to their designs &amp; dreams. #AZ05 https://t.co/7doIVLM8FzI'm looking forward to participating in a tax cuts panel before @VP touts the many achievements of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump administration. This administration has consistently put Americans first with its policies. It will be a fun afternoon.
https://t.co/BS12mlpo6m #AZ05I always enjoy visiting the small businesses in #AZ05 and learning more about their business operations and meeting their employees. More good news is on the horizon with the @POTUS @realDonaldTrump economy for our small businesses.This week is #SmallBusinessWeek. The American economy is growing stronger because of our small businesses, and the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" has contributed mightily to these successes. #AZ05 https://t.co/3XtpdF31jDSorry I missed the Northern Arizona Military Affairs Commission, Southern Arizona Defense Alliance, Mesa Industry and Defense Council, Yuma 50, Davis Montham 50, Ft. Huachuca 50, and the 162nd Air Guardians. Thank you for all you do in support for America's Armed Forces. #AZ05Because of votes, I was sorry to miss some of the attendees who stopped by my office but was happy to chat with Sally Harrison (Mesa Chamber of Commerce) and Duane Mullenix (AZLabs) after I returned from the floor.Last week, a number of statewide and local leaders for the Arizona defense community came to D.C. for meetings on Capitol Hill and at the White House. #AZ05 https://t.co/k4uKGZnLEOThis weekend, a group of @Hamilton_High School students represented Arizona in the @CivicEducation We the People national finals.

Looking forward to being home in #AZ05 next week, meeting with many constituents and businesses around the East Valley. https://t.co/4cdFS0hd4nLots of positives still found in the U.S. economy thanks to the work of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &amp; Congress to cut taxes &amp; reduce America's regulatory burdens. We must not stop with our worthy goals to fully unleash our economic potential; there is still more work to be done."The US economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter"

"there was a 3.4% increase in disposable income — the highest since 2015 — because of the new tax law" 

https://t.co/796sCPWn83@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #Obamacare continues to hurt my constituents, and I have not forgotten my commitment to fight for a full repeal of this disaster. Congress should take up this debate again this year! #AZ05It's absurd to blame @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for #Obamacare's soaring costs &amp; disappearing insurance providers. Former President Obama forced Obamacare on Americans - &amp; found ways to unilaterally change it dozens of times after it became law of the land. https://t.co/DnfYrP1eQsThat approach would quickly spiral out of control &amp; start eroding Americans’ 1A rights. Instead, we must encourage free market alternatives to mainstream internet &amp; social media platforms so that individuals have more choices. I will work w/ my colleagues to achieve this result.Today’s @HouseJudiciary hearing shed significant light on these reports and gave lawmakers insight into the documented incidents of perceived suppression. However, government must not overreact with regulations.Today I attended the @HouseJudiciary Committee hearing on social media filtering practices with @DiamondandSilk.

I’m concerned that internet and social media platforms are suppressing conservative voices around the nation. https://t.co/Syob7FiavkIf Robert Mueller had an ounce of decency within himself, he'd recuse himself from his investigation (which happens to be outside of the scope he was originally assigned). Watch my discussion with @LouDobbs on @FoxBusiness on the latest w/ the DOJ: https://t.co/4QKUdZ7EB2 #AZ05@HouseScience @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I look forward to learning more today from our witnesses about this topic, about their efforts to advance understanding in this field, and about the technologies and methods that will lead the way to a better and smarter future.@HouseScience @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Adverse space weather presents unique challenges &amp; consequences of inaction could be catastrophic. However, I believe that through the right combination of government monitoring, private industry innovation &amp; American determination, we can respond to any future challenges.@HouseScience @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It is my hope that, on the subject of space weather, we will continue to look to that law as a model.@HouseScience @POTUS @realDonaldTrump What I like most about this legislation is that it compels the government to innovate by partnering with the growing private sector to test and validate its data in order to enhance our nation’s forecasting capabilities.@HouseScience Last year, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump signed into law the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, a comprehensive bill to increase our weather forecasting capabilities to better protect lives and property.@HouseScience In the face of space weather challenges, instead of continuing to think inside the “government-only” box, NASA and NOAA need to look to private partners who are ready and willing to help.@HouseScience Partners in the private sector can—and should—use their advanced and innovative technologies to help us more thoroughly understand these phenomena and improve our space weather predictions.@HouseScience Forecasting space weather depends on understanding the fundamental processes that give rise to hazardous events.  Particularly important is the study of processes that link the Sun-Earth system and that control the flow of energy toward our planet.@HouseScience I look forward to hearing from them about not only what their efforts have been in this arena, but also what they think the future holds for the observation, modeling, and forecasting of space weather events.@HouseScience I am glad, then, to have key stakeholders from private industry as well as academia, along with leaders from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, with us here.@HouseScience While all of these topics are important and worth addressing, I think it is crucial that we first lay the groundwork for understanding the current policies, procedures, and major players in both the private and public sectors.@HouseScience There are many avenues we could explore for this hearing, from innovative space weather technologies and the accuracy of space weather forecasting models, to the potential impacts space weather can have on our terrestrial environment.@HouseScience With an issue as complex and consequential as this one, it is undeniably important we begin a dialogue on what the status quo is and in what direction momentum is heading.@HouseScience Good Morning, and welcome to today’s @HouseScience joint Environment and Space Subcommittee hearing, entitled “Surveying the Space Weather Landscape.”  I would like to first thank our excellent witnesses for being here today and for testifying on this important topic.
