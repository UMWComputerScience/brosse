According to recent studies, there has been a shocking 846% increase in suspected child sex trafficking reports in recent years. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDayToday is #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay. This crime hides in plain sight both in our community and throughout the country. We must provide justice for victims and hold perpetrators of this crime accountable.Today, the House of Representatives passed a resolution supporting the rights of the Iranian people &amp; condemning the regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests.

That is what this #TaxReform bill gives them. https://t.co/zLSuRZKjCFEmployees across Missouri &amp; the country are already starting to see the benefits of the #TaxReform, just in time for Christmas! https://t.co/2UoCDlCiMgMost importantly—after 30 years of a ballooning tax code—this historic tax reform sets the stage for American families and our economy to prosper. #TaxCutsandJobsActThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is pro-family tax reform that expands the Child Tax Credit, doubles the standard deduction, lowers individual rates, and preserves the adoption tax credit and retirement savings options I fought hard to keep.Today, we are delivering on that promise and no media hyperbole or partisan backlash will change the bottom line. This bill cuts taxes for middle income Missourians, allows American businesses to flourish, and paves the way for an increase of good-paying jobs.In 2012, the people of Missouri's 2nd Congressional District sent me to Congress, and I promised them that I would find a way for families to keep more of their hard-earned money.Today we celebrate the 226 year anniversary of the ratification of the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution. It is my honor to protect these rights each and every day as a member of Congress. #BillofRightsDay https://t.co/gsrgvcFZql.@POTUS signed #FY18NDAA into law.
