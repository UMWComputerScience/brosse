As the House and Senate engage in negotiations on a final Farm Bill, I will continue fighting for West Texas and a strong and prosperous agriculture economy in the United States.Additionally, as the Representative for the largest cotton producing region in the United States, I have concerns about an amendment that, if adopted in the final Farm Bill, would weaken market stability for U.S. cotton producers and manufactures.With tremendous growth in our economy and millions of surplus jobs in America, there has never been a better time to promote the dignity of work and self-reliance.Without requiring able-bodied adults to work to receive government assistance, we will continue trapping low-income Americans in a bleak cycle of government dependence and poverty instead of a bright future of prosperity and self-reliance.However, I am disappointed the Senate did not address the long-overdue and much-needed reforms to the food stamp program, which accounts for roughly 80% of Farm Bill spending.I commend the Senate for passing their version of the Farm Bill, which maintains many of the same provisions in the House Farm Bill, including a strong and reliable safety net and language similar to my House amendment to help sustain rural health care.Farmers across America are struggling with the steepest decline in net farm income since the Great Depression. Without a strong Farm Bill delivered on time, they will not be able to continue feeding and clothing the American people and fueling our economy.With Justice Kennedy’s retirement, President Trump has another opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise: to appoint justices who will interpret the Constitution as intended, not to rewrite it and legislate from the bench.I wish Justice Kennedy a happy retirement. I am overjoyed at the historic opportunity for another appointment from President Trump and the generational impact a more conservative Supreme Court will have on the culture of this country.As a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I will continue to monitor the progress of VA facilities across our district and work on legislation that ensures VA serves our veterans with the same level of care and service they gave us.Great to see progress made at the VA’s nursing home facility in Big Spring, recently achieving a perfect five-star rating this year! https://t.co/XysHjiJ8X7They risk life and limb for our nation’s sovereignty, and we must ensure that they get the care and service they deserve when returning home.

Doing so will mean more small business can obtain affordable, patient-centered health care for years to come.This week the Trump administration issued a rule to expand access to association health care plans, providing much-needed relief to these Main Street job creators. It is estimated that the new rule could lower premiums by $8,000 and provide coverage for over 400,000 people.Over the past four years, health care premiums have doubled, and millions of self-employed individuals as well as small business owners and their employees have been disproportionally affected by Obamacare’s regulations. https://t.co/9yol9icTlEProud to see this resolution pass out of the House Budget Committee, but even prouder to be on a committee that has the political will to ensure a better, fiscally-sound America.The fiscal year 2019 budget sets us on a sustainable path by reducing the real driver of our debt – unchecked mandatory spending, chipping away at the deficit, and balancing the budget in nine years. https://t.co/dYRKrU5q23Two hundred and thirty years ago today, our Founding Fathers ratified our enduring Constitution, setting into motion the greatest experiment in liberty and self-governance the world has ever known. https://t.co/kdrMgzFFGrFresh off of the House floor after casting my vote for the 2018 Farm Bill. It’s a great day for farmers and ranchers across West Texas! https://t.co/zY4wr37mAFA farming heritage is ingrained in the very fabric of our country, and this Farm Bill will ensure that our farmers and ranchers have the support they need and keep farming part of America’s future.America was pioneered and built by the grit, sweat, and determination of farmers throughout our great land.Not having to rely on other countries for our basic needs is a matter of national security, and the biggest reason this Farm Bill is so important to all Americans.Thomas Jefferson said agriculture was the ‘first and most precious of all the arts.’ Jefferson’s words reflect the self-evident truth that if we cannot feed and clothe our own people, we are no longer an independent, self-sufficient nation.Our food stamp reforms increase accountability, reduce waste  and inefficiency, and - most importantly - break the cycle of government dependency and restore the dignity of work in this country.The 2018 Farm Bill gives our producers much-needed certainty and stability, makes critical investments in rural infrastructure, and requires able-bodied adults to work in order to receive food stamps.As a trillion-dollar industry, agriculture is 5.5 percent of our total economy and employs over 21 million people, including one out of every seven people in the great state of Texas.Elizabeth Walker from Abilene is the epitome of a servant-leader and one who is well-deserving of the Congressional Award Gold Medal, which honors young Americans for service in their communities.

I joined @TeamCavuto today to discuss our nation's immigration policies and possible legislative reforms. ↓ https://t.co/z1cBji1jYGCongress must act on legislation that funds border security, expedites deportation hearings, authorizes new detention facilities, and allows families to be kept together while waiting for court hearings.We can administer both justice and mercy by ending ‘catch and release’ policies in order to deter illegal immigration, while at the same time, keeping families together - but it is Congress’ responsibility to change the law to do it....of our country as de facto residents. These Obama-era ‘catch and release’ policies not only circumvented our own immigration laws and undercut those who sought to respect them by waiting in line, but they exponentially increased illegal immigration over the years.The word is out, if someone wants to bypass the legal immigration process of the United States, bring your children – even if you are risking their lives in the process – tell officials you fear for your lives, and you will be released into the interior...The current situation at our border highlights the fundamental brokenness of America’s immigration system.

Gianforte, a Constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms an individual may serve as a Member of Congress.From the beginning, @POTUS has led from a position of peace through strength.

Happy #SmallBizWeek! https://t.co/wHh8ddqEYEThank you, Mr. President! The 22nd Amendment limited the terms of our president; it’s time to do the same for Congress starting with our freshman class. Let’s change the DC culture and give power back to the people - #DrainTheSwamp! https://t.co/mKtZ0t8K2STo strengthen the Transition Assistance Program, I introduced the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William "Bill" Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvement Act of 2018, legislation named in memory of my dear friend, a Plainview High School graduate and decorated Navy Seal.If we do a better job equipping our servicemen and women on the front end of their transition, we can reduce the number of veterans who struggle with unemployment, homelessness, and suicide. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of intervention.Our government spends billions of dollars preparing citizens to be warriors, but invests only a fraction of that helping those soldiers transition to civilian life. https://t.co/y6AjppQGjaI am saddened to hear of the passing of former Abilene Mayor Fred Lee Hughes. Fred Lee was a true public servant, greatly beloved by the Abilene community, and my prayers are with his family at this time. https://t.co/eDwHuetFiDCongratulations to Lubbock HS for making it to the @DOE_SC_NSB this weekend!

Fortunately for businesses across our country, Congress has been successful in providing meaningful tax and regulatory relief to fuel similar economic growth.We’ve had a few victories for cotton this year, but, rest assured, that won’t stop our pursuit in better supporting our farmers. Always great to meet with @PlainsCotton! https://t.co/QO0PUM3ah0As the son of a tractor salesman, cotton has been present throughout my life and is one of the reasons I have remained committed to our producers throughout the region. https://t.co/mRbR4Ngn3rUnfortunately, FDR’s thoughts on cont'd dependence on gov't relief has come true – generational dependence on welfare has indeed created “a spiritual and moral disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national fiber.” It's time we reform our welfare policies. #SNAPmatters https://t.co/l98iEcqnrwWest Texas values are consistent with the values of the military. Hard work, sacrifice, determination and service - that is West Texas.

After 8 years of burdensome regulations and high taxation, Americans are finally benefiting from a strong, growing economy. https://t.co/swZnOzOsCDOur farmers and ranchers are essential to the vitality and security of this great nation, and this legislation helps ensure the prosperity for production agriculture and rural America.

See below for a few of my thoughts ↓ https://t.co/OyDLZBTnbGThat being said, NAFTA must be renegotiated to allow for free and fair trade, and should be done before further addressing China’s unfair trade practices.

Thirty five percent of farm income is derived from export sales and trade with Mexico and Canada under NAFTA account for $3.3 billion in economic activity.Spent time with Roscoe High School students and discussed why rural America makes America great! Go rural America, and go Roscoe! https://t.co/Av6V8TvubsI support our president in these efforts and have always believed that border security is national security.By deploying the National Guard to the border, President Trump continues to demonstrate his unwavering commitment to stopping illegal immigration and restoring rule of law in this country.In the words of Ronald Reagan, “A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.” Border security is first and foremost about the safety of the American people and, therefore, must be our top priority. https://t.co/bOG5GLp4wUHere is an update on Sophia’s progress since her brain surgery:

Our nation needs more of this. https://t.co/sTLUzUjmOrIt's not our government or its policies that make America great, but rather the people of our nation, especially those that have a heart to serve others. https://t.co/fggUizRO5R30,000+ folks in attendance from all over the world and over $8 million to the local economy. Sweetwater is at the intersection of agriculture and energy production - feeding and fueling America! https://t.co/sJOdBsu6DJGreat day with my son, Nathan, at the Sweetwater Rattlesnake Round-up.  He loves this uniquely West Texas event. https://t.co/9hz1WYEgfQDonuts + the good people of Sweetwater and Roscoe make for a good morning and even better conversation about the impact our policies are having on local communities. Together, we are changing the culture of Washington and enacting real, positive change. https://t.co/dNW2PMj64jEnjoyed visiting with folks from @SlatonBakery yesterday. It was great to have a bit of West Texas flavor in D.C. and hear how family–owned and operated small businesses are thriving in District 19.

Check out a few of their nutty facts here: https://t.co/pltxxHCJNx https://t.co/yL038hkb4HWhat I'm reading: https://t.co/oa09n8XHJ7Joining my fellow Texans in remembrance and celebration of Alamo Day. #RememberTheAlamoWhen people think of Texas, they envision a place for a fresh start, where the potential for economic opportunity seems as limitless as the plains of the Lone Star State, and it would not be what it is today had it not been for the brave men at the Alamo. https://t.co/IlA9ffTxPjToday the House passed legislation aimed at bringing our community banks regulatory relief so they can continue to provide vital services to families, small businesses, and ag producers.Community banks make up over 50 percent of banks in rural communities and employ 20,000 folks in District 19. However, they are being crushed by government regulations. With each passing day, one community bank closes its doors. https://t.co/LdNdfVzNZZWith the long-awaited victory of permanently restoring cotton in the agriculture safety net and the recent announcement of ginning assistance for the 2016 crop, we are well positioned to pass a strong, reliable Farm Bill. https://t.co/OmUNmyVSwD
