I didn‚Äôt get everything I wanted in this bill, but no Member did. And that‚Äôs how the process is supposed to work.Today the House overwhelmingly approved the first long-term FAA reauthorization bill since 2012. https://t.co/ANkKvZ6TcFToday the House will begin considering my bill that will provide long-term certainty for America's aviation.
