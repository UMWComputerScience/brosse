They don’t need a taxpayer bailout. https://t.co/WP0tfQDZDnCommunity Health Centers are vitally important to many of our communities. It was a pleasure to visit today with Steven Racciato, Maggie Estrada, and Eisha Jones representing Health Center of Southeast Texas to hear about the care they’re providing for those who need it most. https://t.co/i8KkHNCjlhI welcome steps taken by @POTUS to sanction Russia in aftermath of acts of mischief, aggression, cyber attacks &amp; attempt to influence US elections. We must stand w/ Britain &amp; other allies to make sure those engaged in these actions are brought to justice. https://t.co/moQdqmttIvCriminal aliens should NOT be allowed to hide from law enforcement in illegal sanctuary cities. I’m proud of the 5th Circuit Court's decision to allow TX to continue cracking down on sanctuary cities. The safety of Texans &amp; U.S. citizens should come FIRST. https://t.co/EPAYjEpkfZFormer VP Dick Cheney joined us at last night’s National Security Intelligence Forum to discuss vital NatSec challenges.

He will serve well as our new SecState.We are all saddened to hear about the #ChannelviewHS band bus crash in South #Alabama earlier today.

That pressure, in spite of harsh criticism frm Dems/media that labeled Trump a warmonger has brought them to the table.

Thanks for having me on the show! https://t.co/7qJCFrszjCThis week, the House took a major step to rein in websites that fail to take common sense safeguards to combat their websites from being used for sex trafficking. The evil and inhumane act of sex trafficking must end and this bill will help do that. https://t.co/3ai4yNx0IZOn this day, we remember the courage of the #Texas settlers who declared independence from Mexico 182 years ago.

This tragedy was preventable, &amp; we must make sure these mistakes are never repeated. https://t.co/UPWzBxmYwSJoined @TeamCavuto with @FoxBusiness to talk about the need to focus on deporting criminal aliens. Our @ICEgov officers have enough to worry about without having sanctuary mayors, like Libby Schaaf, tipping off the criminal aliens ICE is trying to arrest and deport. https://t.co/1clC0R1J7LIt was an honor to be in attendance as #America says thank you and farewell to Billy Graham. His guidance and unwavering faith touched too many lives to count.

Now that the federal funding has been provided the details of recovery are being set by localities and the state government. https://t.co/oNE0VQP76fI spoke on House floor about how folks are using tax savings in #TX36. Many are benefiting from #TaxReform. Families are able to pay debt &amp; repair storm damage from #HurricaneHarvey. Businesses are creating jobs causing economic growth across Texas &amp; US.  https://t.co/g5L8sDMLppThere were warning signs for years about the FL shooter. Those who could've prevented it ignored signals: multiple calls to @FBI, dozens to local police, run-ins w/ school officials &amp; warnings from parents &amp; neighbors. The real issue here is why were these dots never connected? https://t.co/w3wMnq4XbgBig companies like Apple &amp; Disney aren’t the only ones benefitting from #TaxReform. Hundreds of small businesses across the US have been able to give employee bonuses, provide raises &amp; expand their businesses creating more jobs &amp; continued economic growth. https://t.co/4VhphVAvPzNorth Korea continues to be a threat to its neighbors and the US, and I support @POTUS decision to expand sanctions against them.

Please pray for those injured in the truck that was on the tracks. They need it.Tonight, the message from @POTUS was loud and clear — AMERICA IS BACK! America is on the rise again and the American people will continue to see the benefits. After a year in office, we are a safer, stronger and more proud nation. #StateOfTheUnion https://t.co/ol1BsTzO78I've read the memo and strongly believe it needs to be released to the public. The American people deserve to know the extent of abuse and anti-Trump bias under Obama's FBI and DOJ. I encourage the President to #ReleaseTheMemo for the American public to see.More great news! #TaxReform continues to deliver more jobs, higher wages and new investments, right here in #America. https://t.co/Af9uwWdpShEnjoyed attending the Jasper-Lake Sam Rayburn Area Chamber of Commerce 99th Annual Chairman’s Banquet on Friday.

Thank you for having me! https://t.co/n2HOUAojL0BIG NEWS — Due to #TaxReform, @FedEx just announced $200 million in wage increases &amp; employee bonuses &amp; $1.5 billion in new pension funding for workers. It now stands that over 3 MILLION Americans will receive a tax reform bonus. Of course this is only "crumbs" to @NancyPelosi... https://t.co/39gbhlyvuVI am proud to have been able to speak at the Southeast Texas Rice Symposium yesterday in Winnie, Texas. Rice is such an important crop grown in District 36th and I am always happy to visit and listen to the needs and concerns of our hardworking rice farmers. #TX36 https://t.co/owqI4aYzvXToday we honor the brave men/women who gave their lives in pursuit of space exploration.

All thanks to #TaxReformIncredible...this shows depth of anti-Trump bias, which included “secret society.” On top of that, FBI “failed to preserve” 5 months worth of #StrzokPageTexts! We need full investigation to ensure those who sought to undermine @POTUS are held accountable. https://t.co/WRvf3zXESiHopefully they have learned their lesson &amp; will start focusing on the real issues facing the #American people. Our #troops and military deserve better. They are not bargaining chips for illegal immigration. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/c7YFn55Qgn.@SenateDems have finally come to their senses &amp; ended #SchumerShutdown. But let’s be clear: For 3 days, they held our troops &amp; children’s health care hostage in order to get their way on illegal immigration. In the end, their reckless tactics didn't work &amp; commonsense prevailed.Ive read the memo from House Intel, &amp; am shocked at the corruption. Ive signed onto @RepMattGaetz’s letter to @DevinNunes, Chmn of Intel Cmte, asking for memo to be released to the public. Americans deserve to know the truth. Letter here→ https://t.co/hXKJI1858C. #ReleaseTheMemoHad to pick up supplies from @HarrisTeeter for an unexpected weekend in DC. The #SchumerShutdown &amp; Democrat filibuster of our bill to re-open the government is why.  Getting their way on DACA is apparently more important to them than paying our troops and helping #Harvey victims. https://t.co/KY1bdhVUji.@SenSchumer &amp; @SenateDems must end their politically motivated shutdown &amp; pass bipartisan House bill that keeps government open. The #SchumerShutdown is harming our troops, blocking CHIP heath care for children &amp; obstructing relief for #Harvey victims in #TX36. https://t.co/oHMiJjfbV2UPDATE: Over 75% of participants have said they OPPOSE the #SchumerShutdown. If you have not yet done so, vote here: https://t.co/PiTgPD20TA. https://t.co/smtffIUbMmAre you opposed to @SenSchumer (D-NY)’s plan to shut down the federal government because the funding bill does not include the #DACA amnesty program?

Tragically, there have been over 60 million children lost to abortion in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade. I proudly stand w/ today’s marchers as they give voice to those who can't yet speak for themselves. https://t.co/giFIrIHU4PWill @SenateDems really shut down gov't tonight over an illegal amnesty program that doesn't even need to be addressed for months? How about passing bipartisan bill we approved last night to keep gov't running &amp; extend #CHIP for 6 years? #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/HTku5lrgNkWe lost a true American &amp; local hero w/passing of #WWII #FighterAce Lt.

This is what happens when you get the government off the backs of America's employers. https://t.co/9MZsSiwWVhSome are upset because we passed largest #taxcut in US history.
