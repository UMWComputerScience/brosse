This week the River Kidz looked the Army Corps in the eyes and told them that they will no longer tolerate our community being destroyed. Our children shouldn't be forced to do this, but together, I'm confident we can make a real difference.

https://t.co/f0hIWsthVgNearly a month of discharges have put our children &amp; our economy at risk. Public meetings to listen are important, but we also deserve  answers to questions like: at what point, if any, is water considered too toxic to send into the St. Lucie River?
https://t.co/902J04A50hThe other night I took my son to the Korean War Memorial &amp; the WWII Memorial to learn about those Americans who gave everything to defend our country. Love to see my children soak up history about our great country &amp; those brave men &amp; women who help make our country great. https://t.co/McIOdDOE2hIt’s not right that the children in our community have to face the consequences of pollution they had no part in producing. I'm hopeful that the River Kidz’ work will help the Army Corps &amp; Congress recognize this injustice &amp; make the changes we need. 
https://t.co/rzDT037RtnThe #RiverKidz are standing up to the adults who have, for decades, allowed discharges to threaten their health, their summers &amp; even their lives. Our message is very clear: we want clean water; we want a healthy environment; we want real change, now! https://t.co/spbeOLNVrXI am hopeful that these young activists’ stories that they shared with leaders in Washington, D.C. yesterday will help bring about real change!

https://t.co/OVZwLeTqUrWhile many kids across the country may be going to fishing camp this summer or spending their days on a boat or at a beach, our kids are doing all they can to avoid any contact with our water because every day it is being made more and more toxic.Joining the River Kidz as they advocated passionately w/ @RepGarretGraves , @RepBillShuster &amp; the Army Corps yesterday was inspiring! We’re fighting to show exactly how destructive Lake O discharges have been to our homes &amp; why they must end immediately!

https://t.co/j5t7pCMcOMThank you to the #RiverKidz for joining me in DC this week to fight passionately for our community &amp; the future of our waterways! Together, we can make a real difference for our local environment, our homes, our economy &amp; our way of life.

https://t.co/PozX4fCHVJAs our algae crisis gets worse by the day, we are owed answers (at a minimum): How much pollution is too much? How much danger to our community is too much? How much before this will stop? Our community deserves to know what the Army Corps thinks.

https://t.co/N4OvWGG5B9The River Kidz got the chance today to tell the @USACEHQ why they refuse to allow their summers to be ruined year after year. We will not stop fighting until they no longer have to live w/ the fear of going in our own water! It was great to be able to make this meeting happen! https://t.co/9Td06mHa0cThe River Kidz have met with @RepGarretGraves , @RepBillShuster and the Army Corps to tell them face-to-face how important it is to stop Lake O discharges and keep our water clean. Now, they are headed to the Senate to continue the fight!

https://t.co/NZdfEE6oPKI had a great time meeting with the Congressional Gold Medalists from around #FL18 this week in the Capitol Building.  They have earned the prestigious medal as a result of their hard work and service to our community! https://t.co/GzSssARRmLI delivered a jar of water from Stuart to the House Floor to show my colleagues just how disgusting our water has become. We deserve answers on why our health &amp; safety is viewed as a lower priority than other factors when these decisions are being made!  
https://t.co/0ruBoTpcfvThe River Kidz activism and passion for keeping our water clean gives me great hope for the future of our waterways.  I’m looking forward hosting them in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday for #LagoonActionDay!

https://t.co/8DD2EJitz9Right now nearly half of Lake Okeechobee is covered in algal blooms (more than 270 square miles)! Our community is owed an answer: how much danger to our community does the Army Corps admit is too much? https://t.co/HxgKjyDyDnLast week, we passed 30+ bills to combat the opioid epidemic. But our work to combat this crisis isn’t over. That’s why this week, we continued that effort by passing 20 more bills to enhance opioid addiction treatment &amp; abuse prevention efforts. Read:
https://t.co/msDAtmXCLvIt was great meeting with the  @alzassociation Advocates Group, including Doris from Stuart, to discuss critical legislation we are working to get through Congress to improve treatment for Alzheimer's patients! https://t.co/qlS5dgLYxrThe water management decisions made by the Army Corps have life or death consequences for our community. With this ongoing emergency and human health crisis, the least we are owed is an explanation. This must stop!

https://t.co/qz0XkP6c5f@USACEHQ We know what the answer should be, but it’s unclear if that’s something they’re even considering before destroying our community and risking our health.This is a simple question and we deserve an answer from the @USACEHQ : at what point, if any, is water flowing from Lake O too polluted, dirty, or toxic to send into the St. Lucie River?

https://t.co/FRmOp15Pf8Our residents deserve answers as to why the health and safety of the citizens of the Treasure Coast is viewed as a lower priority than other factors that the @USACEHQ  considers when making decisions regarding discharges. Read my letter demanding answers from the Army Corps: https://t.co/4jWBAtGUeXMilitary creeds are not just words on paper—they are words we repeat to ourselves and remind ourselves of every day. These are things that define us as servicemembers, and have to continue to define us as veterans.

https://t.co/kllFstZOLxMAJOR COMMUNITY ALERT: @USACEHQ will hold a public meeting to seek input on the #SB10 reservoir 6/28 at the Blake Library (2351 SE Monterey Rd) in Stuart. This is a great opportunity to tell them about how discharges have impacted you! #SendTheWaterSouth

https://t.co/b54ZOWH1e1We passed dozens of bills last week to combat the opioid epidemic by increasing access to treatment, cracking down on drug trafficking and more.   And we’ve got more up for consideration this week.  Read here:

https://t.co/EZV8pSP7iiUnlike our water, our message is very clear: We want our businesses back. We want our weekends out on the water with our kids back. We want our way of life back. We will not stop fighting until discharges stop and our water is returned to its pristine state! https://t.co/e9WsSLg4saAttention @USACEHQ : when you destroy the environment in our community, you destroy the people in our community

https://t.co/g8qDbBbZWDThis week, we made major progress to combat the opioid crisis by passing more than 30 bills to secure the necessary resources to improve addiction treatment &amp; prevention, expand research into the epidemic, stem the flow of illegal opioids &amp; much more: https://t.co/CmChnrulpsLike the leaders at @USACEHQ , I was an Army soldier. We have worn the same uniform. Our ethos as warriors says we never leave a fallen comrade behind, but the Army Corps is right now leaving our community to die.  

https://t.co/haGVttcC8sI met this week with Mike Oetker, a regional director for the @USFWSSoutheast , to demand answers on why our threatened species are being ignored as toxic water discharges continue to devastate their habitats. We will keep the pressure on! https://t.co/4Sz9eDO28LWith the destruction of our waterways growing worse and worse every day, the Army Corps is collecting feedback on the SB10 southern storage reservoir. Use this email to tell them what you think! → eaareservoir@usace.army.mil

https://t.co/PCG84ryTv5Our veterans have fought hard to protect our nation, and we should fight just as hard for them when they get home. That’s why, this week, we passed two bills to increase VA staff for programs that support returning veterans:

https://t.co/fXaLyiIrsOEvery day, men and women around the globe go out there with one unified mission: to protect and defend the United States of America. Washington could learn a thing or two from them.  Happy birthday to the @USArmy— celebrating 243 years of honor &amp; courageous defense of our nation! https://t.co/P2YZmomTKi@USACEHQ ...That’s why I’m inviting Army Corps’ senior leadership to come take a swim in our waterways— if they feel the water is acceptable for our children to play in, for us to fish in &amp; for our endangered animals to live in, then it should be good enough for them to swim in also. https://t.co/R5IBp6vfBgThe @USACEHQ seems to think it’s OK to discharge toxins into our waterways without regard for the health effects for every man, woman and child in our community...115 people die every day in the US as a result of the opioid epidemic. Clearly, more must be done to save lives. That’s why, so far this week, we’ve passed 25 bipartisan bills to secure resources &amp; support to reverse this horrific crisis. Read more:
https://t.co/33mOBdCO0e https://t.co/ZN5NNpilLGThanks to Daniel, Karina and Susanne from Jensen Beach and West Palm Beach for visiting our Washington, D.C. office to talk how we can work together to protect our environment.  The failed status quo is not acceptable! https://t.co/glwDrcKpm8We will not stand for our environment being destroyed! That’s why I’ve invited @USACEHQ leadership to visit our coast so they can look small businesses owners in the eye who are being forced to close their doors &amp; explain why our lives are not a priority. https://t.co/JMfrUjjt48...Our bipartisan bill, the Burn Pits Accountability Act, will go a long way towards making sure that servicemembers and veterans exposed to burn pits get the quality that deserve and badly need. https://t.co/JqJT9PY8vhOur servicemembers put on their uniform every day and happily do the jobs they’re told do, no matter how dangerous.  That’s exactly how we should be taking care of our servicemembers and veterans when they come home...This is what happens when self-interest and special interest are prioritized over our community for decades.  I will not allow the Treasure Coast to continue being the forgotten coast! Read more about my legislation here: https://t.co/aefQJZpBSr

https://t.co/lZ4gKkDQThFar too many children’s lives are tragically cut short by cancer. That’s why I’ve been a strong supporter of the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, which is now law, to strengthen cancer research and improve access to life-saving treatments! https://t.co/992I1ZwQTEWe live with this. But those who don’t live here turn a blind eye and continue on with their lives. That cannot continue!  You can report algal blooms to force testing for toxicity in our waterways so everybody else must confront this devastation also!  

https://t.co/cO5TvocFRW https://t.co/hhAbAeveFPJune is Alzheimer’s Awareness Month, but the reality is that awareness simply isn't enough. That’s why, as a member of the Alzheimer's Task Force , I’ve supported bills like the RAISE Family Caregivers Act &amp; the CHANGE Act to make progress for patients &amp; focus on finding a cure. https://t.co/OrURO6rgWiWe know all too well that tragedy can strike when we least expect it, whether at a night club, a school, a concert venue or anywhere else. That’s why we just passed a bill to provide new resources to combat gangs &amp; reduce gun violence by enforcing the law.
https://t.co/dSyGW00lrjTell the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters what you think about Lake O discharges --&gt; https://t.co/cTN4DxXH4y 

Read my letter to them calling for discharges to STOP --&gt; https://t.co/eL6URncVPD

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!This amendment is a win-win: giving disabled veterans a great opportunity to transition into a new career while improving constituent services in congressional offices across the country.

https://t.co/nlrvnowGmHOur unemployment numbers are breaking records thanks to tax reform and less red tape—2/3s of Americans now say it’s a good time to find a quality job! https://t.co/nLxGfmjx1tThank you to Martin Memorial for giving me a tour of your radiology department and for the critical work you do for patients on the Treasure Coast! https://t.co/mo0mBLjntaIt's unacceptable that the Army Corps thinks it’s okay to continue Lake O discharges w/o knowing, with certainty, whether the water is safe. That’s why I’m calling on them to cease ALL Lake O discharges immediately. We can't afford another lost summer!
https://t.co/QaHHw9BuAkWhen I was serving in Afghanistan, almost everything was burned in open-air pits. Now, servicemembers &amp; vets who've breathed in toxic air from these pits are experiencing dire health effects. We must do more to help them! Watch our hearing on this issue: https://t.co/z8bq3TQUHfDischarges destroy our community, businesses are shuttered, people get sick and our environment is destroyed.  This must end!  That’s why I’m calling on the Army Corps to cease discharges immediately unless they can prove that the water is safe! https://t.co/lNF1tdOquXI will not tolerate a status quo that prioritizes everyone else’s interests over ours!

https://t.co/ZOeQPnjlIUI won’t stop fighting for our community until we can weld the gates at Port Mayaca Lock and Dam shut because discharges are no longer necessary!We cannot afford more devastation from discharges! That’s why I’m calling on the Army Corps to immediately cease discharges and why we passed a bill this week to deliver major progress for our water.

https://t.co/P3F4D14CCCFor too long, our so-called “leaders” in government have failed to act. They’ve ignored us as toxic algae made people sick, as our pristine waterways turned sludge green, as dead fish washed up on our once idyllic beaches. No more! Here’s what I’m doing: https://t.co/621QhRibm5Why is the Water Resources and Development Act (passed this week) important for #FL18?  Watch to hear about some of the highlights:

https://t.co/a7aKO6iYWB...Passage of this bill brings us one step closer to getting the southern storage reservoir built and includes other major wins that will help prevent toxic algae.  No longer will Congress fail to act when the situation is so dire!

https://t.co/rQuUyqoLP4The Army Corps’ discharges from Lake Okeechobee are unacceptable.  Our community cannot afford more devastation.  We cannot afford a status quo that prioritizes everyone else’s interests over ours...I will not stand idly by while discharges destroy our backyards, people get sick &amp; our environment is destroyed! That’s why I'm calling on the Army Corps to stop discharges until the water quality is deemed safe or an imminent threat to life exists.

https://t.co/3jg5InvsyhCheck out some photos from @IAVA 's 2nd Annual Salute Award ceremony last night ➡ https://t.co/74phXxyESwI was honored to be presented the @iava Salutes Award for working on behalf of servicemembers &amp; veterans exposed to burn pits, but our fight is just getting started! I'm deeply grateful for IAVA’s critical work on this important issue. Let’s get it done! https://t.co/Pl68XaBIXRSpeaking and asking questions now at hearing on burn pits.  Watch live: https://t.co/MxgEe0rjZ3Watch live as the @HouseVetAffairs Committee holds a hearing on the health impacts of exposure to burn pits, including my bill to improve care for veterans: https://t.co/sphtW2P6GwYesterday, I had the opportunity to attend the historic signing of the VA MISSION Act at the White House, which will greatly improve care by giving veterans more flexibility and choice!

https://t.co/9cd0tqZZt0The discharges from Lake O are unacceptable. #FL18 cannot afford more devastation &amp; a status quo that prioritizes everyone else’s interests over ours. No longer will Congress fail to act when the situation is so dire! Read about big wins we just passed: https://t.co/6gcPJFiwOYMore great news for the economy—the number of job vacancies now exceeds the number of unemployed workers. This comes after data released last week showed payrolls increased more than forecasted last month &amp; unemployment fell to the lowest since 2000 --&gt;
https://t.co/qMq8YbITIaToday we remember and honor the brave American and allied heroes who stormed the beaches of Normandy 74 years ago today. We are eternally grateful for their courage and the valiant sacrifices they made that day. https://t.co/FqK4kaLZkBNow that the Army Corps has referred the southern storage reservoir plans to @OMBPress,  we’re holding OMB’s feet to the fire to dedicate all necessary resources to get this sent to Congress ASAP so we can authorize the project! https://t.co/UFGyuAAmOkWe are very close to getting the SB10 reservoir authorized— last week, the Army Corps referred the plans for the reservoir to @OMBPress, bringing us one step closer to #SendtheWaterSouth! Read more about it here: 

https://t.co/KBhrey20NN@SeagrenSharon Always happy to talk about new ideas!  We're at 202-225-3026!The good news is that we’ve secured a commitment to authorize the EAA southern storage reservoir (from Senator Negron’s SB 10) and several other big wins for local water in the upcoming water infrastructure bill, which will be voted on this week!This weekend I joined protests over the Lake O discharges.  We have made our message very clear: we will not continue to let discharges destroy our backyards—it’s not what we’re going to stand for.

Read my full statement: https://t.co/VbKfHQVfUc@DWP1726 @realDonaldTrump Iran has imprisoned US citizens, taken our sailors hostage &amp; fired rockets towards our Navy. They have test-launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles &amp; threatened to use those same missiles to strike US military bases.The list goes on. Iran wants America and Israel destroyed..@realDonaldTrump's action today is a decisive first step in the long road to undoing the damage caused by the Obama Administration's historically bad Iran Deal. No deal with Iran is far wiser than a bad deal!  Some more thoughts: https://t.co/yxyMyxGoGAServicemembers that were exposed to open burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan are seeing terrible health effects at a very young age. Our bill will help evaluate exposure to burn pits and get these veterans the care they need!

https://t.co/yhuxxIcpeEThanks to @PBCountySheriff for a tour of their regional fusion center. The center's mission is to stop threats of terrorism, help first responders during disasters and support law enforcement. https://t.co/6nXKv1bXZSTwo years ago, they promised to have the safety measures in place by the time they began service.

Congratulations to the class of 2018! https://t.co/M9r6oSHxvuThat’s why the small business tax cuts from our #TaxCutsandJobsAct were so important.

https://t.co/otIdCD8biXI have no doubt that the young patients I had the chance to meet yesterday at @StMarysMC 's @PaleyInstitute will come out stronger than ever! With improvements in technology, these children have a bright future ahead of them! 
https://t.co/HSoK10trnKToday I had the pleasure of touring the @PaleyInstitute in West Palm Beach, which specializes in bone and joint conditions.  The perseverance of these kids to not let physical limitations stop them is inspiring! https://t.co/xZj5i2epkNThanks to @FLOceanographic for hosting a great conversation with community leaders and river advocates to discuss the path forward for getting the SB10 reservoir authorized in upcoming water infrastructure legislation!  #SendTheWaterSouth https://t.co/lbTkp6eknZLast week we passed bipartisan FEMA reforms as part of the FAA reauthorization that will provide greater focus on pre-disaster mitigation—that means building smarter &amp; better, while saving taxpayer dollars. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure! https://t.co/LnhxmQ7EuAIt’s clear that Brightline isn’t qualified for the federal government subsidy they’re after to expand on the Treasure Coast. That’s why Senator @marcorubio @congbillposey and I are demanding answers for this reckless abuse of taxpayer money!
https://t.co/V7nGsQ0TfmWhile I may no longer be an asset on the battlefield, as your Congressman, I still go to work every day with the same goal: keeping Americans safe &amp; free.  In short, it’s about putting country first— here’s what we got done this week toward that goal:

https://t.co/jrEukQKxhtOpioid abuse frequently begins with extra prescription medication left lying around.

https://t.co/csvJ6ff9DGSeveral decades after the Holocaust, many victims &amp; their families have yet to recover property wrongfully confiscated from them during WWII.

https://t.co/ftSkDQlQSnThe IRS website crash this week showed just how bad it’s gotten at the IRS. The good news is, this week, we passed a series of bipartisan reforms that will improve technology to make filing your taxes easier and more efficient next year.

This #EarthDay, let’s double down on our efforts and make 2018 the year we get it done! #SendTheWaterSouth https://t.co/fVNIYUbj1kBipartisan bills we passed this week will strengthen cybersecurity, increase protections against identity theft and dramatically upgrade IRS technology to bring service into the 21st century. Read about them here --&gt;

https://t.co/19ejbZ8VjJThis week I had a singular mission: put taxpayers first.  Watch now --&gt;

https://t.co/qNhlVR3EyXThis week, under oath before Congress, Brightline admitted that they lied when they said that their project is "not publicly funded at all." Now, they say "there has been public funding granted. How are we expected to trust anything they say?

https://t.co/IZ7VYJfYJsAnd their deception about the use of taxpayer money is equally unacceptable, which is why I'm calling on @USDOT to revoke their allocation of tax-exempt Private Activity Bonds for Brightline and put a stop to taxpayer subsidies for this dangerous expansion!ICYMI: Brightline couldn’t answer basic questions yesterday about our safety concerns so they resorted to insults instead, calling Treasure Coast residents “narrow minded.” https://t.co/rwsOQKbNGuTo Brightline I say this: it is not narrow minded to care about the safety of our children; it is not narrow minded to care about your repeated lies and misuse of taxpayer dollars; it is not narrow minded to care about our economy and the protection of the community we love.Today Brightline President Patrick Goddard called us on the Treasure Coast “narrow minded.” You might want to consider that this entitled attitude is one of the reasons we don’t want your train on the Treasure Coast to begin with! https://t.co/6DqXEC1AjPToday, Brightline admitted they lied when they said their project is "not publicly funded at all." Brightline's president also personally attacked us, calling Treasure Coast residents "narrow-minded."I don't think caring about safety makes us narrow-minded.https://t.co/Nmc19sI0YoI asked for an oversight hearing to look into Brightline's false claim that they are "not publicly funded at all" &amp; their application for tax-exempt funding claiming that their train is actually a "highway." The hearing starts at 10 a.m. Watch it LIVE: https://t.co/rrvUwBrRAqThere's a silver lining to tax day this year-- in addition to the tax cuts we passed late last year, this week, we passed a desperately-needed overhaul of the IRS system with one singular mission in mind: taxpayer first. 
https://t.co/ZKrEhONUnzI'm committed to getting the SB10 reservoir authorized so we can cut discharges, clean up our waterways &amp; #SendtheWaterSouth. To make that happen, the Army Corps must sign off on the design &amp; they’re looking for your input on the proposal. Learn more here:
https://t.co/q47ICrXAF7Taxpayers deserve the truth about who's paying for Brightline, &amp; our community deserves answers about why they're refusing to address critical safety &amp; economic concerns. That’s why I asked for this hearing tomorrow. What questions do you want answered? 
https://t.co/DXNZJKUK4DThis bill is just the start of protecting our interconnected waterways in Florida.  For our environment, recreation, economy and wildlife, we MUST do more!  Our waterways are a non-negotiable priority!

https://t.co/YzHxkYh43fToday's the LAST day you'll have to file your taxes under the old system w/higher tax brackets &amp; more complicated rules. Next year you'll be filing under the new rules &amp; that means lower taxes, a higher standard deduction, a bigger child tax credit &amp; more! https://t.co/CVbdqmYE8VTune in this Thursday: At my request, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee is holding a hearing on how Brightline keeps working to secure billions in taxpayer-subsidized funding while claiming to be “not publicly funded at all.” https://t.co/3HPFmMB7GvTomorrow is the deadline to file taxes this year (last filing with the higher tax brackets!).  Haven’t filed yet?  Here are some tips for filing at the last minute --&gt; 
https://t.co/qGoXee7zXiEvery year families &amp; small businesses are forced to set &amp; live by a budget. 46 states are required to have balanced budgets, but the federal government keeps spiraling into more debt.  This is just common sense: we need a balanced budget amendment! https://t.co/LuPgOFD5x0Our debt is one of the greatest threats to our national security &amp; economy. That’s why I voted yes on the Balanced Budget Amendment, &amp; I wish more of my colleagues would have done the same. We owe it to our children &amp; grandchildren to take action soon!

https://t.co/TqCqLSDTByNeed more time to do your taxes? Here’s how to file a free extension --&gt;

https://t.co/UQJVUDA14tThis is one of the most ridiculous and frustrating things I’ve seen since I got to Washington: 184 Members of Congress just teamed up to block a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution! The status quo is not working - we need to take action now!

https://t.co/f6unvBAMGZHuman trafficking is modern day slavery, and we must put an end to it. The good news is we passed two bills this week that together will cut off funding for human traffickers and increase penalties for stalking children.

Here are some resources to help you recognize the telltale signs of a scam--&gt; 

https://t.co/a5bJNQqYeSFor decades, the Coast Guard has owned property on Jupiter Island that has been left unmanaged &amp; overgrown. My bill to conserve this land passed through Committee today – the last major hurdle before it goes to the House Floor for a vote! https://t.co/LydSOzXtXhToday we remember the 6 million Jews and millions of others senselessly murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. We must ensure that the lessons of the Holocaust are never forgotten to prevent an atrocity like this from ever happening again! https://t.co/5H8zo79rM0Today, @POTUS signed the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act into law, a bipartisan bill I’ve been supporting to crack down on websites that facilitate online sex trafficking – a critical step to helping law enforcement go after these disgusting criminals! https://t.co/el27yfSFWhAs a result of our tax cuts bill, @UPS made a $5 billion voluntary contribution to its employees’ pension plan and is investing another $7 billion into new facilities that will lead to more jobs. Sorry if your package delivery was slower than usual the other day - I’m a novice! https://t.co/MQjoCJ9PlSStuart residents— due to a backup generator failure, the city of Stuart has issued a boil water notice.

https://t.co/CbW4BcoMGvDue to an unavoidable maintenance issue at the VA, our office at @VAWestPalmBeach will be closed through the rest of the week.

Today is #WorldAutismAwarenessDay, but let’s work together every day to  support resources that help our neighbors w/ autism. https://t.co/u8ze8dCQm8We kicked off our seniors listening tour this morning at Indianwood in Indiantown. Because of high demand, we’re extending the time today – staff will be available until 2pm at Indianwood to help w/any issues regarding Medicare, Social Security, the VA or other gov't agencies. https://t.co/9rNThzRgOAOur veterans deserve better than the service they’re getting from the VA right now.  I’m committed to do better for them. More transparency, accountability and support is needed!

https://t.co/01DlpI3HIDWhen we opened our office inside the @VAWestPalmBeach  it took a year of cutting through red tape to simply give our veterans the transparency they deserve. My new bill will make it easier for all lawmakers to open offices inside their local VA hospitals. https://t.co/Npt8PvogSFI know from experience how difficult it can be for veterans to navigate the VA. That’s why I decided to open an office in the @VAWestPalmBeach, &amp; my new bill will pave the way for lawmakers across the country to do the same. We must do better for our vets! https://t.co/TaIbsT8dpGIf you want to fix a problem, you need to be present for it.  That’s why I get my health care through the VA and why I opened the first Congressional office inside a VA facility. Now, we’ve got to get it done for veterans all across the country.

https://t.co/D3TmLkCXUGI want to make it easier for veterans to have their voices heard &amp; get the help they need. My new bill will make it easier for all Members of Congress to open offices in their local VAs so veterans around the country can get the same high level of support.
https://t.co/vw1g3oB9ZwI believe every single Member of Congress should have an office at their local VA like we do, which is why today I introduced new legislation to pave the way and make that high level of service a reality for our veterans across the country. 

https://t.co/9UOiqlyfUeGlad to have you on! https://t.co/LVXeRzGpEWThis reservoir is a critical step forward to restore our lagoon &amp; beaches, &amp; we cannot afford to wait another two years as it drowns in federal bureaucracy. I will do everything in my power to ensure we get this project started without any further delays.

https://t.co/003HMjzstyOpening the 1st-ever Congressional office inside a VA hospital has allowed us to help veterans on the spot: when &amp; where they’re having an issue. I'm in Stuart introducing new legislation that will pave the way for ALL Members of Congress to do the same: https://t.co/KAeGLy8jj2For those that have put everything on the line for #USA, the service &amp; sacrifice doesn't end when they get back on American soil.  That's why I opened an office in @VAWestPalmBeach to help vets where they need it.  More news coming this week...  https://t.co/lYwNtG3RzZFor those that have put everything on the line for our country, the service and sacrifice doesn't end when they get back on American soil. We must do all we can to help our veterans by fixing the VA &amp; supporting those struggling with PTS.

Today, I sat down with @SFWMD to discuss why these priorities are so critical and what we can do to get them funded by Congress. https://t.co/63gndhmtu3I spoke this morning with leaders of metropolitan water agencies about how my bill, the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Reauthorization Act, will speed up investments in our water and help address critical infrastructure failures.

Their grandson suffers from cystic fibrosis and they’ve been tireless advocates to raise awareness about this complex genetic disease. https://t.co/afLkvHpjaJOur community can’t afford to wait any longer: this week I questioned the Army Corps about how we can cut red tape and finally get to work on critical water infrastructure projects that we need like the S.B. 10-authorized EAA reservoir. Watch: https://t.co/0llDTFHLuEWe continued conversations this week about much needed VA reforms with @ConcernedVets, @ConnectingVets and others.  What do you think should be the #1 priority for veterans? https://t.co/fUikPcjHniIt sickens me to think that there are people out there who cheat our low-income and elderly veterans out of their hard-earned VA benefits.

I'm also a co-sponsor of the bill.This may have been my busiest week ever in terms of meeting with veterans organizations like @AMVETSHQ, @IAVA, @PVA1946 and @VFWHQ – all great conversations on issues like veteran mental health, accessibility and fixing the systemic issues plaguing the VA. https://t.co/z6DeDBGE3zMy goal: make our community safe, healthy, and strong.  This week we worked to strengthen national defense, security at our schools and efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. Watch for more: https://t.co/djMpnYCugfIt’s hard to stomach the idea of dogs being abused at the VA – it’s inhumane, disgusting &amp; a massive waste of taxpayer dollars.  That’s why I’ve been working to put an end to taxpayer funding for these horrific experiments, &amp; we’re building momentum --&gt; https://t.co/mkZhaEwe5MWe must keep the pressure on NK as the President continues to send shockwaves through the regimes of murderous dictators!  Sanctions have been working, &amp; we’re going to keep ratcheting up the pressure on NK and Iran to advance peace &amp; global security.

https://t.co/4CgMqW78z3I've requested a "placeholder" for the S.B.10 EAA Reservoir project in our upcoming "Water Resources Development Act" to make sure it's included. Otherwise, the project will have to wait two more years for the 2020 legislation. That's not acceptable. https://t.co/ez5F1q9CkAThis #InternationalWomensDay, we recognize all the women who have looked inequality up and down and said NO MORE!

https://t.co/YXT30gEtddThis is absolutely unacceptable.

Watch: https://t.co/EBEE9d9CqmI had the pleasure of introducing a resolution written by the dedicated students of the Weiss School in Palm Beach Gardens, who designed a satellite selected by NASA to be launched into space through its CubeSat Launch initiative...Peace in the Middle East has been elusive, but I believe it’s closer and more attainable than it’s ever been due to the blunt honesty that is finally being applied to our foreign policy. Congress and the President are saying: no more blood money!

https://t.co/WKgxyK16icHamas has taken the disgusting &amp; cowardly step of using children, the sick &amp; elderly as human shields for terrorist activities.

In Army, when I saw chance to save life, I didn't hesitate: we worked together to get it done. Let's use your temporary travel ban model in same way now: to save lives by halting sale of AR-15 until we pass long-term solution. https://t.co/hqBS9Cg8jxWhen I was with others on the battlefield &amp; we saw a chance to save a life, we didn’t have a meeting about it; we acted immediately. Not being able to control everything, should not prevent us from doing something. Every single life is precious. WATCH: https://t.co/FAVesTSMGuMy rifle in the Army was very similar to the AR-15-style semiautomatic weapon used to kill at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.  I cannot support the primary weapon I used to defend our people being used to kill children I swore to defend. https://t.co/4UNhAaulGuThis is absolutely unacceptable.  Congress must hold oversight hearings to determine what went wrong, hold the FBI accountable and reform what is clearly a broken process. 

https://t.co/47giEEOsTvIt’s important that we work together at all levels to support the Parkland Community and work to address these systemic and societal issues. 

https://t.co/8CiouNCDL1The English language is beautiful, but in moments like these, there are simply no words to describe the heartbreak. There are so many hurting today and we must support them by working to take the stigma out of mental health so that everyone can get the resources they need.Please join me in praying for this community &amp; supporting our local law enforcement that runs toward the sound of gunshots instead of away. They need our support now in Parkland &amp; our law enforcement officers across country need our support always to help prevent these tragedies.High school students, families, teachers and parents living in Florida - or anywhere else - should never have to have this experience.I have seen great evil across much of this world and serving in the military – seeing death first hand while having to hold your fellow soldiers as the last breath went out of them – gives you a perspective on life and the value of humanity that few other experiences can match.My heart is breaking for the community at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. I have lived there, about 5 minutes from the school &amp; have had the great opportunity to meet many of the students there. These were our neighbors &amp; their parents, our friends.Thank you to the @IRSCTheRiver Board for stopping by to discuss some of our shared education priorities for 2018!Our tax cut bill has produced one of the biggest boosts in small-business optimism in US history!

https://t.co/kyOxkYXIxUGlad to hear POTUS outline bipartisan agenda to rebuild infrastructure. Decades of failures to fix water issues in FL have created untenable situation - toxic discharges. I'm hopeful we can turn proposal into a bill that addresses these issues. Can't afford to wait any longer.Tonight the President will give his State of the Union Address. Here’s my take on what I hope to hear—from more resources to fix our water infrastructure issues to a bipartisan plan that continues strengthening our economy and national security —&gt;
