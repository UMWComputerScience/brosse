Granting amnesty while failing to implement necessary reforms to end chain migration, mandate the use of E-Verify, or improve the H-2A system for our farmers is unacceptable.Enjoyed touring Lee Container Corporation in Homerville and seeing firsthand how #taxreform is helping small businesses and hardworking Georgians in our community.
