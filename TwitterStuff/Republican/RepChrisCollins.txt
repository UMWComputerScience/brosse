This type of behavior puts lives in danger during emergency situations and he should be ashamed.Since @NYGovCuomo has been in office, NY has diverted an estimated $400 million, or about 42% of the money collected for these important 911 services. This is one more example of our Gov selling our rural areas short again #WNYNY has some of the highest surcharges on cell phone bills for 911 services, meant to improve the way callers are pinpointed by 911. Hardworking NYers pay for these services. Looks like @NYGovCuomo has been diverting this money to his slush fund for years https://t.co/DGT0g0m38NThe FCC released a report that found NY was wasting money paid for 911 services, diveritng it to non-emergency services. @NYGovCuomo can you let us know where this money is going?

Companies are taking action and changing the lives of everyday employees.Today @NYGovCuomo once again made a decision that’s bad for business.
