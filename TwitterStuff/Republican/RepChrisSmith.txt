On the shootings at Trenton Art All Night: https://t.co/irmWWHxi3zToday’s new CDC numbers on autism regrettably show a greater prevalence—up 20% in NJ to 1 in 34 kids.  This quantifying of prevalence of autism—mandated by my legislation—helps us fight for &amp; secure much-needed fed support for treatment &amp; education of children w/ autism.This morning, I spoke at the signing of the STOP Offshore Oil and Gas Act by Gov. Murphy, in Point Pleasant Beach: https://t.co/3jcAXiMW5ZMy statement on the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush, a woman full of grace: https://t.co/IQ7eGcRmVfThe @HumaneSociety yesterday awarded me as a Legislator of the Year. I have long supported proper funding and strong enforcement of animal welfare laws, and we must ensure that any and all horrifying abuse and exploitation of all types of animals is stopped. https://t.co/PD3iIzUaZyProvisions of my Kevin and Avonte’s Law helping children w/ autism &amp; seniors w/ Alzheimer’s were signed into law as part of the Omnibus.

What happened in Parkland must never happen again--there is no higher priority for us right now than school safety. https://t.co/1vW0h7qDQOThe funding of the Gateway Tunnel in the omnibus is an important start. I will fight to ensure the fed gov keeps its promise. Time is of the essence here.Was happy to host students from Hamilton HS West for a tour of the US Capitol during #PublicSchoolsWeek. We had a good conversation on trafficking and other issues, and I was impressed with the depth of their questions. I am proud of our schools and all our bright students! https://t.co/fN0XPETDTTDuring #NationalWalkoutDay, the House adopted an important school safety bill, HR 4909, that I cosponsored. There is no higher priority right now than the safety of our students—we must do all we can to protect tomorrow’s leaders today.Today's ruling against the monster power line proposed for Monmouth County was a victory for safety &amp; economic concerns of local residents; I opposed this project for those very reasons. Rachael Kanapka &amp; her group RAGE were rock stars in fighting this project.W/ so many rail passengers crossing daily b/w NJ &amp; NYC &amp; the tunnel in need of repair, the time to build the Gateway Tunnel was yesterday. The House approved $900 mil. It’s time for the Admin to do its part &amp; cover half the costs.The internet should not enable human trafficking, &amp; those complicit must be held accountable. I was proud to co-sponsor The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 to crack down on this abuse. The Senate should act quickly to pass this critical bill.Met w/ @SecretaryZinke to discuss NJ offshore drilling. I &amp; other NJ members were clear about it: not now, not ever. The Secretary heard our concerns, &amp; the meeting was encouraging. If the proposal for New Jersey is not already off the table, it will soon be.Our hearts and prayers go out to all the victims, survivors and family members at today’s deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS in Parkland, FL. Thanks to the first responders, police and medical personnel who moved swiftly to help the wounded and save lives.Today I joined, via Facetime, NJ citizens rallying in Hamilton against the Administration’s offshore drilling proposal. I am unequivocally opposed and am working with local citizens and colleagues to make it clear: not here, not now, not ever. https://t.co/oU62GrXPVWViewed 25 student-created apps today at Point Pleasant Borough HS, including “Lunch Buddy,” the winner of the NJ-04 2017 Congressional App Challenge.

Hope those injured recover quickly.I was pleased that the President last night reported new jobs &amp; rising wages &amp; emphasized support for paid family leave, the need to rebuild our infrastructure, address the opioid epidemic, &amp; establish accountability at the VA. Both parties in Congress must address these issues.Today is #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay. The suffering of more than 25 million trafficking victims worldwide—who are mostly women and children—must spur us to work even harder for their rescue, for the prosecution of traffickers, and to end this cruelty.I am unalterably opposed to the Secretary of the Interior’s proposal to open up coastal waters to oil and gas exploration and drilling. This poses serious risks to NJ’s beaches and commercial fishing industry. https://t.co/2MEpvMklpt https://t.co/iMlgCsNQe3I continue to oppose the current tax bills because of the negative impact on New Jersey and will vote No todayWhile I believe Americans are overtaxed and need relief, I must vote “no” this week on the tax bill, H.R. 1, because of its negative impact on both New Jersey and my congressional district. https://t.co/EFVpyTKtXBSpoke at a sobering ceremony opening the “Journeys Beyond Genocide" exhibit at Brookdale College yesterday, honoring victims &amp; survivors of three different genocides.
