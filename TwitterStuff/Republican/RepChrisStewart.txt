Public release would follow the step-by-step process laid out in House Rules.

I expect that that will happen.The House Intelligence memo that everyone is taking about is the result of months of diligent investigation by the Committee.

The Committee is responsible for making the memo available to all members, and is working overtime to ensure every member has a chance to review.Democrats are trying to preclude us from displaying this poster. Hilarious. 

https://t.co/RXTnenadKkMr. Schumer why do you care more about illegal immigration than children's health care. CHIP is important for 9 million children.  Please...open the gov back up!!Hey demacrats...please....all we're asking. Open the government back up.Why won't the Democrats agree to border security? Why is immigration more important than funding our soldiers. Why are the Democrats insisting on a shutdown when they know it hurts American citizens. End the Schumer shut down!!!ICYMI: Utah's four House members voted last night to support a long-term extension for #CHIP, a critical state-run healthcare program for thousands of children in Utah.

This type of modification to a gun should be controlled.I’ve asked the ATF why these devices were approved without restriction in 2010 and again in 2012.Like most Americans – and most gun owners – I wasn’t aware of bump stocks. It is my view that these devices deserve scrutiny.9-12 month background check. Federal registration. Local registration.Ownership and transfer of the remaining automatic weapons is a tightly controlled process.But manufacturing of automatic weapons for civilian use has been banned since 1986.I fully support the second amendment and will not support any bill that threatens our constitutional right to bear arms.I grew up hunting. I shot guns when I was in the military, including automatic weapons. I own guns. I’m licensed to carry a concealed weaponThe first responders rushing towards the concertgoers amid a hail of bullets to save lives.
