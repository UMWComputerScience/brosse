Together, we can make bipartisan consensus on #ClimateSolutions a reality.@DefendOurFuture Whether you're motivated by love of nature &amp; the outdoors, religious doctrine to protect God's Creation, or responsibility to the generations to follow us, we all have the duty to be good stewards of our planet. Something we need to remember all year ‚Äì not just on #EarthDay.@DefendOurFuture Younger generations have the most to lose if we don't act on #ClimateChange. The only way we'll achieve permanent, lasting policy is in a #bipartisan way. To make a difference, advocates need to not only stay informed, but engage both parties on this issue to maintain credibility@DefendOurFuture @EPAScottPruitt Once you've lost the trust of the public, you're no longer able to be an effective official. Add to that his disrespectful and reprehensible misuse of American taxpayer dollars, there's no point in @EPAScottPruitt continuing to serve. (3/3)@DefendOurFuture @EPAScottPruitt But putting that aside, these scandals are an embarrassment, and they make it impossible to give @EPAScottPruitt the benefit of the doubt that his positions have just been based on bad policy &amp; not also on inappropriate influence from outside special interests. (2/3)@DefendOurFuture @EPAScottPruitt I've never been a fan of @EPAScottPruitt's policies. Whether it was his public doubts about basic science regarding CO2 emissions or his misguided comments about evolution, I've had some serious policy concerns for sometime... (1/3)@DefendOurFuture @EPA Absolutely. #SoFla is on the front lines of #climatechange. I'll continue to speak out &amp; rally support from to ensure #FL26 &amp; all of #Florida's federal needs are met. Fortunately, more of my colleagues are joining me to make protecting these programs a priority in appropriations.@DefendOurFuture Finding new ways to de-politicize this issue and providing those in positions of influence with a direct connection to #climatechange and #sealevelrise are the only way we‚Äôll secure meaningful, lasting #climatesolutions. (3/3)@DefendOurFuture Like any issue, different people connect in different ways. Some Republican priorities ‚Äì like fiscal responsibility and national security, for example ‚Äì go hand-in-hand with combating and mitigating for the effects of #climatechange. (2/3)@DefendOurFuture I‚Äôm proud the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus has gotten 36 Republican Members in the House on the record acknowledging #ClimateChange is an issue we need to address and committing to finding #bipartisan solutions. (1/2)@DefendOurFuture There are so many #ClimateSolutions that have #bipartisan support. To name a few ‚Äì building more resiliently to save money on the front end, spurring job growth by supporting American #cleanenergy innovation, investing in and encouraging mitigation among vulnerable communities.@DefendOurFuture @RepTedDeutch Third, we need to be realistic short- and long-term. We need to celebrate every step forward. If our response is always "It‚Äôs not enough," we'll not only discourage those already giving it their all, but also never motivate enough leaders to make this issue a priority. (3/3)@DefendOurFuture @RepTedDeutch Second, we must keep bringing people to the table by explaining these issues in ways that make sense to them. For some it's economics ‚Äì the longer we wait, the costlier it becomes. For others, it's national security and the effects of #climatechange on military readiness (2/3)@DefendOurFuture First, we need to de-politicize the issue. Regrettably, it has became extremely politicized after the 2000 election, and its been an uphill battle since. Fortunately, there's hope in Congress where @RepTedDeutch&amp; I co-founded and co-chair the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus (1/3)@DefendOurFuture Also, dealing w/ threats of #ClimateChange &amp; economic prosperity aren't mutually exclusive. U.S. private sector has already started to reduce their carbon footprint. Without American leadership, we'll miss an opportunity to be on the front lines of clean energy innovation (2/2)@DefendOurFuture Ignoring or denying this issue will only cause more problems in the future. The longer we wait to address #ClimateChange &amp; #SeaLevelRise, the more expensive &amp; drastic solutions will need to be to make a realistic impact to counter already developing effects. (1/2)@DefendOurFuture @EvergladesNPS @BiscayneNPS @FloridaKeysNMS @DryTortugasNPS After receiving a briefing from @NOAAResearch, I knew I wanted this issue to be one of my legislative priorities. So together w/ @RepTedDeutch, I co-founded the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus to work toward de-politicizing #environmental issues &amp; building #bipartisan consensus. (3/3)@DefendOurFuture @EvergladesNPS @BiscayneNPS @FloridaKeysNMS @DryTortugasNPS When I was first elected to Congress, I knew #FL26, the district I represent at the southernmost tip of #Florida, needed their representative to champion combating the direct causes &amp; preparing for the inevitable effects through mitigation. (2/3)@DefendOurFuture I've always had a deep appreciation for the natural beauty of #SoFla. From @EvergladesNPS and @BiscayneNPS to the @FloridaKeysNMS and @DryTortugasNPS, #FL26 has some of the most remarkable ecological treasures in the world. (1/3)@DefendOurFuture It‚Äôs my pleasure.
