We will never forget the millions who suffered under the injustice of slavery. 2/Many of us celebrate American independence on July 4th. However, June 19 is a symbolic date representing the day ALL Americans became free and independent ‚Äì when slavery ended. It started in Texas in 1865 when 250,000 enslaved people were liberated. Now it's called Juneteenth. 1/"When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space.  We must have American dominance in space." -- @POTUS

I look forward to working with President Trump and our Air Force. (4/4)This problem has been studied in depth since the 1980s, yet few reforms have been made and fewer still have taken hold.

For too long, too little emphasis has been placed on space defense. (2/4).@POTUS Trump announced he has directed the Department of Defense to establish the Space Force as a sixth military branch. As part of his national security strategy, the president has said ‚Äúspace is a war-fighting domain, just like the land, air, and sea.‚Äù (1/4)Space defense is a serious issue the U.S. needs to improve ‚Äì it requires just as much attention as air, land, and sea defense.

This means great things for the people of Colorado, particularly in the Fifth Congressional District. 1/The defense spending top line for the FY19 budget which the Committee will mark to is $717 billion -- a much-needed influx of funding our military needs to rebuild and modernize.The House Armed Services Committee (HASC) will be marking up the National Defense Authorization (NDAA) act today.I echo President Trump's gratitude to Israel for uncovering key intelligence that helped in the decision to pull out of the deal, and I also extend the same message of hope to the Iranian people suffering under this brutal regime. 4/4It's a welcome change to have an Administration that takes Iran at its word that they want to destroy our country, our allies, and our way of life. Understanding this threat is the only way we can make our country safe again. 3/4The deal made no mention of Iran's ballistic missiles program and their human rights abuses. It ultimately allows Iran to start proliferating after the deal expires. 2/4Former President Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran gave the Islamic Regime hundreds of millions of dollars to export terrorism around the world and more gravely, a path to nuclear weapons. 1/4The funds appropriated by the FY18 Omnibus are being used to help the military modernize and make smart decisions such as moving General Raymond‚Äôs staff from CA to CO. Colorado Springs is the epicenter of the national security space enterprise. 3/3It only makes sense to relocate Gen. Raymond's within 30 minutes of his work location instead of in California. 2/3The Air Force announced the relocation of Joint Forces Space Component staff to Schriever AFB, CO from California. This means 148 additional personnel will move to the district at the National Space Defense Center, according to the Air Force. 1/3The Palestinians are taking a hard line and they are defying the US.

Next April will bring a lot of relief to the yearly hassle of filing taxes. The new law is designed to enable Americans to file their taxes in a simple and straightforward way.#3: Doubling the Child Tax Credit to Help Families
The new code doubles the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and makes it available to more families across the country dealing with the costs of raising a family.#2: Nearly Doubled Standard Deduction
The new code will increase the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and  $24,000 for married couples ‚Äì nearly double the amounts available under the old tax code. This will protect more income from taxes.#1: Lower Tax Rates for All Americans 
With lower tax rates, Americans in every community will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money to save or spend as they see fit. In fact, a typical family of four earning $75,000 will see a tax cut of more than $2,000.As we bid farewell to the old tax code, here are the top five ways our new tax code, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, will benefit workers and families nationwide:I toured the SNC Dream Chaser with Commerce SEC. @VP did as well on his way to the Space Symposium today in Colorado Springs.

(3/3)It would open the door to a host of so-called chaplains who represent philosophical worldviews and NOT the distinctly religious role of the Chaplain Corps. I applaud the Navy for upholding the truth. (2/3)I am relieved that the Navy has rejected the application of an atheist chaplain for their Chaplain Corps. Appointing an atheist to a historically religious role would've gone against everything the chaplaincy was created to do.

It makes sense for the Bureau to be located closer to the infrastructure it manages. May I suggest Colorado Springs, @SecretaryZinke, as a prime location?I asked @SecretaryZinke at @NatResources last week more about his proposal to move the Bureau of Reclamation leadership out to Colorado. Both go together hand in glove in their mission to effectively manage water infrastructure..@POTUS in California now: "My new national strategy for space recognizes that space is a war-fighting domain just like the land, air, and sea."

I couldn't agree more, Mr. President. Congress must work to ensure America is the leader in space.The chaplain corps is historically a religious institution that should meet the faith-based needs of service members not advance a philosophical worldview.My colleagues and I called on the Navy in a letter to reconsider appointing a secular-humanist chaplain.

It's unacceptable to leave these pilots without jobs and without opportunities. https://t.co/wm8n2dcjdMThank you @realDonaldTrump for fulfilling your promise to rebuild our military by supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act.Pelosi doesn't want to fund our military service members and their families.

 A vote against the budget is a vote against our brave men and women in uniform. https://t.co/VXWLbo1iA9This deal gives our military more of the resources they need, something everyone should support. Spending gaps and stopgap bills do not help our military do their job and hinder their effectiveness. https://t.co/29orsNm1Q1I signed onto a letter to House leadership asking that Right to Try legislation be brought to the House floor for a vote.

The cemetery has a new director, Mr. Paul LaGrange, who will manage it. It's encouraging to see these developments on a project that's been a long time in the making.The #TaxCutsandJobsAct is pro-family legislation because it expands the Child Tax Creditfrom $1,000 to $2,000.

I pledge to work with my colleagues on the @NatResources Subcommittee I chair to improve our nation's parks, highways, and roads. This is important for our economy, our communities, and our people. https://t.co/q36J3Oml6vThe president called on all of us in Congress to defend Americans -- to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. We will heed your call Mr. President. "Because Americans are dreamers too." #SOTUAs a Member of @NatResources, I'm thrilled at @POTUS' commitment to strengthening our nation's extraordinary national parks by rebuilding our infrastructure. #SOTU https://t.co/kvD0gFC5w7We always celebrate our police, military, and veterans.

He makes us all proud to be American. #SOTUThe middle class and small businesses got tremendous relief this year. Since we passed the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses ‚Äì many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Thank you @POTUS for leading the way #SOTU"No people on earth are so fearless, determined, and daring as Americans."
@POTUS recognized the unity we share as people of this country. #SOTUThis bill holds our institutions to a higher standard in the name of protecting young athletes. https://t.co/mkeo0qromAThe House Intell Committee voted to #ReleaseThe Memo.

https://t.co/1kdLfexZNA https://t.co/RyeirPZU0wParticularly excited to see Sam Brownback's confirmation. He's been a consistent champion of religious liberty around the world.

Religious liberty is a cornerstone of all freedom. We must work diligently to uphold it. https://t.co/BhrXlVLWQhThat's why I cosponsored the A-PLUS act created by @RepMarkWalker. It gives states the freedom to fund schools in the best way possible so that our students achieve their goals.School choice is important for many in Colorado. During #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek, let's celebrate the great opportunities our district has when it comes to public, private, and home schools. We want students to thrive! America's future depends on it.

@schoolchoicewk https://t.co/bco49J2nRQSlashing the corporate tax rate benefits American businesses AND millions of American workers. More jobs, bigger paychecks and bonuses, and investment means a stronger economy for us all. Read my point/counterpoint in the @colo_politics: https://t.co/y3wyTCyo5CThank you @POTUS for nationally recognizing the inherent dignity of every life and embracing the common humanity that unites us all. https://t.co/3sBmhjfKEdThe first thing on my mind when @SenateDems shut down the government: the brave service members and the CHIP kids who this hurts most. If they don't get what they need, then I cannot in good conscience accept my paycheck. https://t.co/gy4ioRRqfZI‚Äôm on @740KVOR talking about the irresponsible #SchumerShutdown and calling for its end! Our military, CHIP kids, and the American people deserve better from Senate Democrats.Senate Democrats shut down the entire government, withholding our troops' pay, over an immigration issue that doesn't expire until March. This is irresponsible and totally uncalled for. The #SchumerShutdown needs to end. https://t.co/9TYwiqLz1qIt's been long enough. If this government shutdown continues, 9 million children will lose health insurance and the military will not be paid. 

Enough is enough. It's time for the #SchumerShutdown to end..@SenateMajLdr ‚Äì Get rid of the legislative filibuster for funding bills. 

Senate majority should be able to do what they were voted in to do.

The Democrat minority should not be allowed to block funding for our military and shutdown the government.@SenSchumer's recklessness last night brought us the #SchumerShutdown. Senate Dems filibustered several individual approps bills in order to force a 60 vote requirement on one all encompassing bill. Filibuster should be eliminated. Let democracy have its place.These are real American lives at stake, many of whom call Colorado home. The #SchumerShutdown rests on the shoulders of @SenateDems and @SenSchumer. They made the choice to put party politics over the good of the country. https://t.co/UQOWq6IobcSenate Democrats "oppose a bill they are not even opposed to." @SpeakerRyan made it abundantly clear: their behavior in forcing this government shut down is reckless and puts livelihoods in danger. https://t.co/PaKRjvIRD0The American people are tired of the same old political games from Senate Dems. Their reckless filibustering forced us into a government shut down. As we've seen, this is a massive hindrance to the democratic way.The #SchumerShutdown means 2 million members of the military will not be paid, 100,00 national guardsmen will be sent home, and 50% of the civilian workforce will be furloughed. They will all continue to protect our country, but they won't get a paycheck.Senate Democrats ripped healthcare funding away from millions of American children over an immigration issue. DACA is not on a deadline ‚Äì but 9 million children just lost healthcare they rely on.Current immigration programs won‚Äôt expire until March, yet, this shut down immediately impacts national security, children‚Äôs health insurance, and more, placing a, ‚ÄòClosed for Business,‚Äô sign on our federal government.Senate Democrats stand in the way of a fully funded government and a reauthorized health insurance program for children. They‚Äôre recklessly holding national defense and other federal services hostage in an effort to force changes in immigration law on the American people.Additionally, a new rule will enforce existing conscience protections for Americans involved in HHS-funded program. This protects them from being forced into participating in activities that violate their consciences, such as abortion, sterilization, or assisted suicide. https://t.co/9UHC2CVVxFMore good news: @HHSGov issued new guidance to state Medicaid directors. States will now have the flexibility to decide program standards. They can take actions against abortion service providers. https://t.co/UU5rylwReH@YouTube @March_for_Life#WhyWeMarch: https://t.co/u9AnJAIHni via @YouTubeI read memo and agree with my GOP colleagues that it must be released to the American public.

Read my joint op-ed with @LifeNetworkCO CEO Rich Bennett here --&gt; https://t.co/xpkWiqamFC @csgazetteI applaud @HHSGov for formalizing a division of their office focused on conscience and religious freedom protection. It will enforce federal law that protects the fundamental and unalienable rights we hold as Americans. https://t.co/cZ02mhUanM.@SenatorDole is an exemplary public servant. We honored his commitment and service today. Congratulations on your award, sir, and thank you. https://t.co/H7XpRgxLzIOur military deserves our utmost respect and support.

I stand with him on this issue. https://t.co/es8rMp1k8K"Unlike many places in the world, our government is not prohibited from referencing or accommodating religion, nor is the government compelled to scrub all religious references from the public square."

Insightful words from @drmoore &amp; @SenatorLankford on Religious Freedom Day. https://t.co/LShHNdetXyReligious liberty is an essential pillar of the United States. All Americans enjoy the privilege of equal rights before the law to worship freely without discrimination. https://t.co/dxehVkxmYWWe remember The Dream, we honor the legacy, and we teach a new generation. #MLKDay https://t.co/IavZX7Je3EIn memory of the truth Martin Luther King Jr. shared with the world: https://t.co/wUO41Fy8W5The federal government should uphold federal law. That is exactly what Attorney General Sessions‚Äô revision of the Cole Memo does. If we‚Äôre honest with ourselves, legalizing marijuana has been bad for the state of Colorado, so I applaud Sessions.
