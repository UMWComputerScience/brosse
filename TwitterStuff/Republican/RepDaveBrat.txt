That resulted in a compromise bill being voted on Thursday and not a single Democrat will vote for it.2) Then, the president increased the number and offered 1.8 million kids relief (nearly 3 times as much as Obama), but the Democrats said no.1) In January, Senate Democrats shut down the government over DACA, saying there needed to be a legislative fix. Republicans offered relief for the 700,000 DACA kids in the Goodlatte bill, but Democrats said no.Democrats say they are concerned about the kids, but at four critical points during the last six months, Republicans have offered policy solutions that would help migrant children and Democrats have shot them down.I look forward to working with my colleagues on real policy solutions that address these issues. I will not engage in bantering and empty political rhetoric. So far, GOPs have made very generous compromise offers to Dems, but they have not been willing to show up and play ball.We need tougher border security, and we need to keep families together. These are not mutually exclusive goals. But, they do need to be solved simultaneously, so we don't make any of the current problems with our immigration system worse.

Check out my interview here: https://t.co/c4kQ55PC1v @WBURI hope GOP leadership is serious about passing a balanced budget amendment, and they work hard to whip votes for this measure. This amendment has a steep vote count. If for some reason it fails, we can always try other fiscal moves with less austere requirements.The deficit is expected to rise to as high as $1 trillion in 2019. Right now, even with our mountainous $21 trillion in debt, we are not even headed in the direction of a balanced budget.In the first six months of the fiscal year, revenues increased by $26 billion. On the other hand, spending increased by $97 billion in that same amount of time resulting in an almost $600 billion deficit.The economy is growing and our revenue is increasing, but our spending is growing at four times the rate of revenue.Along with a balanced budget amendment, Congress should pass a spending limit amendment bill. Here's why...And it would decrease the likelihood that Congress will continue on its current path of bankrupting the United States and shackling our kids with our an unpaid credit card bill.It would restore the balance of power away from the executive branch back to the legislative branch.It would codify Congress’s responsibility for fiscal responsibility.I am supportive of efforts to pass a #BalancedBudgetAmendment for several reasons...Statement on @SpeakerRyan announcing his retirement: https://t.co/tLhK5NflVlI am extremely disappointed Gov.

That is not acceptable. The president should demand a change. And believe me this this was intentional to avoid hard work in the Senate.More, the president and the GOP promised a wall. No fences. A wall. Border wall funding is a priority.Congress should comply with the president’s request to defund these rebel cities – they need to do this through a budget.There are large swaths of the American homeland that are in open defiance of federal law.
