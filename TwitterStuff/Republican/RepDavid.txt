If you're in #AZ06, tune into 47.I told @FoxNews = Be prepared for the President's #ImmigrationAction to cost a lot of money. #unintendedconsequences http://t.co/j2ug9a3c3lGlad to see H.R. 4012 pass. Let's continue to fight for transparency. TY for all the support. #publicpolicypublicdata http://t.co/nCX5O4ZPQcDo we all remember our stats 101 class? Data sets are key. Data sets are what we need to see.  #publicpolicypublicdataLet's bring science out of the shadows. Public policy needs to be made with public data.What's so stunningly disheartening here is that if you go back &amp; look @ President's memos he/the Admin demand this same transparency!If you go back 10 yrs, our friends on the left demanded the same thing we're demanding now. #publicpolicypublicdataWe have the confirmation from the EPA itself that they are perfectly capable of blinding any details that are confidential. #secretscience(Cont.) H.R. 4012 is part of that commitment to transparency. #secretscienceIf ur going to make #publicpolicy, do it by #publicdata. Is there anyone, when running 4 office, who didn't commit 2 transparency?Staff will be live tweeting floor debate on Secret Science Reform Act. Look for #publicpolicypublicdata + #secretscience hashtags.En route to the House Floor to talk #secretscience. Glad my wonderful wife is here for the fight for #publicdata! http://t.co/QMCj0BBjqV@bassgod14 thank you for joining.
