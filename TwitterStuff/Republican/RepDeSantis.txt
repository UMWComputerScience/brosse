The Department of Justice has refused to provide documents requested by Congress. Peter Strzok’s blatant political bias has eroded trust in the FBI. Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has a lot to answer for. https://t.co/CvH78crfVSIn case you missed it: last July, I joined Sen. @MarcoRubio in a letter to @POTUS asking that he ensure the Army Corps of Engineers remain neutral as we work to resolve this dispute. https://t.co/YKwbpjKJx8Victory at the Supreme Court today for Florida! Court ruling in Florida v. Georgia is important step towards restoration of Apalachicola Bay.The retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy gives President Trump the opportunity to appoint another excellent jurist — and to solidify the constitutionalist wing of the Court for a long time. Trump has been terrific in his judicial picks and this will be biggest nomination yet!The Supreme Court’s Janus decision represents a huge win for the First Amendment freedoms of public employees. Unions shouldn’t be able to coerce members into paying union dues to fund political campaigns. This decision is long overdue!The concurrence by Justice Thomas was important — he cast doubt on the legal viability of the practice of one district judge issuing an injunction that applies nationwide. As we’ve seen, this practice allows a single liberal judge to nullify national policy on a whim.The Supreme Court has rightfully upheld President Trump’s executive order prohibiting travel from failed countries and state sponsors of terror. Glad the Court affirmed the President’s lawful authority to protect our national security.RIP to Charles @krauthammer, a brilliant doctor and thinker. He was one of the few writers and commentators to make a real difference in the national debate. He will be missed.Peter Strzok’s blatant political bias has eroded public trust, causing significant damage to the institution of the FBI. 

Why is Strzok still receiving a government paycheck? He should be fired immediately. https://t.co/5EIXpQYfoWStarting at 2 PM → chairing a @GOPOversight National Security Subcommittee hearing examining 1996 incident of Hermanos al Rescate humanitarian aircraft shot down by Cuban military, killing 4.

IG acknowledged that FBI employee Peter Strzok’s bias against Trump influenced actions surrounding discovery of Clinton e-mails on Anthony Weiner’s laptop.

Did someone in the bureaucracy deliberately withhold?The following is in the IG report. Why didn’t Rosenstein disclose this to Congress when we asked for the texts?

August 8 2016 Strzok-Page texts

Page: [Trump’s] not ever going to become President, right? Right?!

Strzok: No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.This morning, both @SteveScalise and Matt were back on the field, practicing for tonight’s game. Their warrior spirit is an inspiration to us all.1 year ago, a gunman opened fire on our baseball practice, with a list of Republicans he wanted to kill in his pocket. @SteveScalise &amp; Matt Mika were both grievously injured. By the grace of God, the courage of law enforcement &amp; the skill of their physicians, they both survived.The opioid epidemic has had a devastating effect on the lives of so many Floridians.

This is the only way the American people can achieve accountability. https://t.co/3LoLMXYrZhThe establishment of our embassy in Jerusalem was aided greatly by the superb work of @USAmbIsrael David Friedman. Hats off to David for his tireless efforts — it was an honor to work with him over the past year and to get to say a few words alongside him while I was in Israel. https://t.co/8ZT1Nv3ZwMThe establishment of our embassy in Jerusalem fulfills long-standing US policy as enacted by the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995. It was an honor to be there at this historic occasion! Thanks President Trump for being first president to honor his promise to establish this embassy. https://t.co/LOiVGrIWyMThe only way to deal with a maniacal regime like Iran is from a position of strength. Giving unilateral concessions in the hope of engineering better behavior will not work when a regime is dedicated to a totalitarian and suicidal ideology.The damage done by the Iran deal has been significant, mostly due to the massive cash infusion the deal gave to the Khamenei regime and particularly to the IRGC. Imposing sanctions can reduce the flow of money to the regime.The Iran deal has never been the law of the land because it was never ratified as a treaty by the Senate (or enacted as statutory law by Congress). President Trump had every right to withdraw the U.S. from what was effectively an Obama executive agreement.POTUS has consistently &amp; correctly recognized Obama-Khamenei nuclear agreement as a disaster. Hope he allows domestic sanctions against Iran to be imposed. Won’t fully rectify mistake of the deal but can be start of an approach that holds Iran accountable for malevolent actions.Mike Pompeo will make a great Secretary of State and should be overwhelmingly confirmed. That the vast majority of Dem senators will oppose him just demonstrates that their default policy reflex is knee-jerk opposition to the Trump administration.Looking forward to joining @seanhannity tonight on @FoxNews at 9:30 PM. I hope that you will tune in.Over 100 years ago, the Ottoman Empire forcibly deported and killed over 1 million innocent Armenians. Today we remember the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide and the men, woman, and children who were subjected to the brutality of the Ottoman forces.Referral of Comey due to transmitting classified info was justified and this IG action is probably just the beginning.  By leaking two classified memos for political purposes, Comey will have a hard time demonstrating that his actions were lawful. https://t.co/m4FdIWUJqMTragedy that a special counsel investigation was launched by leaking of the memos (which Comey has admitted). No basis in the memos to trigger a criminal investigation &amp; it is to the discredit of Rosenstein that he caved to the pressure of the media/Democrats &amp; appointed Mueller.Memos paint the picture of an innocent man: Trump was frustrated that Comey kept telling him he wasn’t under investigation yet the public was being led to believe otherwise.  Trump wanted his name cleared &amp; his behavior was consistent with someone who hadn’t done anything wrong.The whole “obstruction” angle was much more a fever dream of the Beltway crowd than it was a serious angle.  The memos don’t provide evidence of obstruction of justice; at best, they show @POTUS making an innocuous lament about the fall of Mike Flynn.The pettiness of the memos is striking.  Comey clearly had it out for Trump from the beginning.Some of the Comey memos contained classified information.  Intentionally leaking classified information is a big no no.  The referral we sent to DOJ regarding Comey has been buttressed.Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez has been hand-picked by Castro regime to maintain its communist tyranny. His “presidency” is illegitimate. The US should not recognize him. https://t.co/ue1YcO9dq3Our letter from yesterday referred McCabe to DOJ for potential false statements and I’m glad to see the OIG follow suit.

Good riddance! https://t.co/xUhuWMV0bWRosenstein needs to produce the Comey memos.  Comey already leaked four of them to his buddy.  Stop stonewalling!Damning report re: Andrew McCabe by the DOJ IG that underscores the dysfunction at the senior levels of the FBI during the tenure of James Comey, who himself has a lot to answer for re: leaks, disclosure of classified information, and lack of candor to Congress and the President.At 2 PM, I will be chairing a @GOPoversight National Security subcommittee hearing on the 'caravan' of foreign nationals expected to seek asylum in the United States.

Tune in to @FoxNews at 9:30 PM.DOJ IG asks the right questions but this review should be in addition to, rather than in lieu of, a special counsel investigation.

I'll be introducing a proposal for a line-item veto very soon.Stuffing more than $1.3 trillion in spending and a number of unrelated policy issues into a single, mammoth bill and ramming it through without any time for scrutiny shows that Congress has hit rock bottom.The 2,232 page omnibus spending bill passed the House after being publicly available for less than 17 hours. This bill was drafted by a handful of members &amp; staffers behind closed doors without the input of rank &amp; file members. Nobody had time to read it, much less understand it.Happening now → chairing a @GOPoversight National Security Subcommittee hearing examining hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.

The latter lacks prosecutorial authority and will take forever and a day to reach conclusions. We need action now!The repeated failures of the Broward sheriff shouldn't let the FBI off the hook for its failures. Congress needs a complete briefing and heads need to roll. We can't let this become another episode of bureaucratic pass the buck.RIP Billy Graham, a good and faithful servant. He fought the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith.Catastrophic failure by the FBI re: the Parkland killer. Protecting society requires a basic level of competence by the authorities. Having members of the public identify threats won't be effective if the authorities fail to act.Terrible day in Parkland with a devastating loss of life.

It’s basically a sloppy, Chewbacca defense rejoinder to the Nunes memo that unwittingly buttresses concerns raised in the Nunes memo.House Intel did the right thing by voting to release the FISA memo. This will answer key questions involving the use of the infamous Steele dossier and other matters.  And it will raise new questions that will need to be investigated.Rabidly anti-Trump lead agent Peter Strzok acknowledged that the Mueller probe would yield nothing.  If even the guy who conjured up the anti-Trump “insurance policy” acknowledged this, what basis was there to appoint special counsel in the first place? https://t.co/poQ5VhJWYuFBI Director Wray needs to provide an explanation for why the FBI deleted six months’ worth of Strozk-Page text messages sent during the Trump transition and early months of the Trump presidency.

We need to pass my Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act so taxpayers get the complete accounting of all settlements paid with their money. https://t.co/8IjVthLMzNThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act conference report represents an improvement over both the House and Senate bills and I look forward to it being signed into law very soon.Reforms included in the bill — the dramatically lower tax rate, the full expensing of capital investments, and the move to a territorial tax system — will better enable US companies to compete with foreign businesses and help stem the tide of companies and jobs going overseas.Moreover, the bill recognizes that America’s business tax structure is antiquated and harms America’s competitiveness.By lowering tax rates, increasing the standard deduction, and doubling the child credit, middle-income Florida families will see their federal income taxes reduced by a significant percentage.Even as the economy has experienced recent improvements, too many middle-income families are having difficulty making ends meet and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide much needed relief to them.Glad that consensus has emerged to stop taxpayer #hushfund payments on behalf of members.  Should include my #bipartisan bill’s other part exposing who has used taxpayer funds to settle sexual harassment cases.Congress needs full accounting of how Russia investigation started, role of the FBI in procuring infamous Steele dossier, whether FBI paid for dossier &amp; way in which the FBI used the dossier, such as using it to obtain surveillance of Trump associates. https://t.co/Je5Ins64DTBoth the House and Senate need to get all these answers and must be willing to do more than just talk.
