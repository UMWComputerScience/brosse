On this Memorial Day, as we gather with friends and family, let us remember our fallen heroes that devoted their lives to protecting our freedom and great nation.I’ve been honored to serve my community in Congress. Cindy &amp; I have decided that I will not seek re-election. 

I look forward to continued public service in my next chapter, where I will return to the practice of law and will pursue opportunities to increase civic education. https://t.co/hI7MDDcjbdToday, I'm honored to attend the ceremony of Rev. Graham laying in Honor in the Capitol. He was a modern day Apostle Paul who converted millions of souls to Christ. Welcome home.

"My home is in Heaven. I'm just traveling through this world." - Rev. Billy Graham https://t.co/zF4zpqV8Fg@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters If consumers really were getting caught in a "debt trap," the data would show consumers "trapped" in the market. 

But Florida, South Carolina, and Illinois each found that payday loan consumers leave the marketplace over time.

That doesn’t sound like a trap.@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters Compare that to reputable studies that bothered to look.

(Economists with the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 did, among others.)

Numerous folks found that over the long term, payday loans provide a net benefit to a consumer's financial situation.@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters Even worse, @CFPB restricted its pool of data by looking at a mere one-year period.

You need a longer period of time  to know how users of these loans behave. Heck, in its own study, CFPB admitted that it needed to analyze data over a longer period of time. It didn’t.@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters @CFPB ignored the abundance of data available from the states, instead taking a broad view rather than a deep dive into the data.

What they did amounted to glancing at several lenders across multiple jurisdictions with different rules and regulations. That’s not a clear picture.@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters Not only does the @CFPB's research fail to establish that payday lending is harmful to consumers across the country in the long term, it also fails to prove that this rule might be effective in alleviating that purported harm.@CFPB If @CFPB is going to regulate, it needs to do so with appropriate data. 

Unfortunately, @SenWarren &amp; @RepMaxineWaters have been misled:

CFPB’s didn’t do anything resembling exhaustive research for five years. They skimmed what little data they cherrypicked.@CFPB First, let’s consider what payday loans mean for the economy: 

12 million consumers use payday loans. 

60,000 American jobs depend on this industry. 

This isn’t a small portion. Many people who need access to credit get it from payday lending.The first words Samuel B. Morse used on the telegraph were, “What hath God wrought?”

I suspect the first 911 call was, “WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!" https://t.co/lFaxYNa79uMy op-ed in the Morning Consult today looks at how @CFPB failed to use accurate and complete data when making its rule on Payday Loans. 

You don’t have to love payday loans to believe that we should be careful about regulating in a way that could hurt low-income Americans. https://t.co/waZH7IUPPRVery moving.

Why are we regulating them out of existence? Watch my debate with @MaxineWaters on the House Floor. 

https://t.co/KXzIlYxI2s https://t.co/e26TMwCeXHThis is such positive news for our economy, and you don't have to view it through a political lens to recognize it: People are in a better place than they were for the last few years.

Properly regulated pay day loans mean people don’t suffer the (higher) expense of a bounced check, a missed payment, or have to turn to less scrupulous lenders. 

State regulators have done this effectively. CFPB took a heavy-handed approach to effectively ban them.Very moving. https://t.co/I1VFWbIyOgThey don’t call him the Secretary of Offense for nothing. https://t.co/jaAnQIJSA3Time to roll back another: CFPB’s de facto ban on Payday Lending. 

Let’s allow low-income Americans to have access to credit when they have unexpected expenses. Join the effort to pass a Congressional Review Act repeal of the rule. 

The alternative, for those in need, is worse. https://t.co/YKtsjpjv7eFor a first-time politician, no less! https://t.co/2PL5pLtFG8Allowing our businesses to invest in their workforce is a crucial part of the tax cut benefit. https://t.co/rJXjbX7kXVAbsolutely right. https://t.co/Y09I0zAw0nI'd tune in, but I think my seatmates will get annoyed. https://t.co/GrMuXwEznFAre you kidding me?

https://t.co/zUV7JswXbjIf you think it's so little (my constituents don't!), then why should it go to the federal government? https://t.co/zUV7JswXbjAre you a student and an aspiring librarian, history buff, or book nerd? @LibraryCongress is looking for paid summer interns.

Such attacks on #taxreform are based on misinformation &amp; rumors. @HouseGOP has been transparent on the new law—it’s great for all Americans, particularly middle class.

https://t.co/ZAaZlQ51Wr https://t.co/cj0m5CFFs4If you’re wondering whether the House got a lot done, here’s your answer. Via @HouseGOP https://t.co/2TK7kOuWpdAnd Congress appreciates you standing up for America and our one of our strongest allies.

This same body voted to equate Zionism with racism &amp; now voted to condemn the U.S. decision that simply recognizes that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.

We will remember. https://t.co/uR77jlybJxDo you think @thinkprogress knows that the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. represents the U.S. to the world, not the other way around? 

Also: Congress approved move of embassy in *1995*. The President's "unilateral" move is (a) based on law and (b) a right of sovereign nations. https://t.co/CboinHNlTJIt's also a mistake to blithely give in to the idea of a United Nations General Assembly that unanimously supports our efforts to help countries liberalize. That's wrong.

Many are actively opposed. Hence the vote against Israel. And why we must hold fast to our principles. https://t.co/2SnmNQ0iLMRemarkable how the Left gets away with actually violent rhetoric, while the Right is held to a completely different standard on normal political language. https://t.co/0P16OTHnLyNever mind that coverage of Obamacare never focused on the delayed impending tax penalties the way that coverage focuses on the sunset provisions in tax reform in 10 years. https://t.co/1OEEViGQFYThrilled to be with @POTUS at the White House following the (second!) historic vote on #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. 

Thanks for all the support, @realDonaldTrump, as we unleash the economy, become more competitive globally, cut taxes for the middle class, and reform our tax code! https://t.co/2rQsKQ0VOBEither way. https://t.co/6YOUVbfl7d@MattYglesias's caricature of GOP position seems completely unaware of what @RepHensarling and @FinancialCmte have been saying since the financial crisis. https://t.co/ASQy0J3Kcz

Stopping financial crises &amp; bailouts is a bipartisan goal. We've been working on it as a committee. https://t.co/S8kopwnRJaReceived a kind letter from @MariaBartiromo.

Sorry, we're just a bit excited about it. https://t.co/R7eEByGvxBI just did a Facebook Live on the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. Tune in and hear why Americans are so excited about this economy-growing bill that we just passed out of the House.

https://t.co/lEEVpeE8PTFYI, I wouldn't try to use that card number if I were you. https://t.co/kT200e6UJhExactly. Americans will see the truth for themselves without the misleading media filter. https://t.co/GzhctoqLS2This promise is about the future: You get to do more with your own money, and you will have more opportunities thanks to the job creating tax cuts we've just passed. https://t.co/AxA9tLR8J7Yes but mine’s correct. https://t.co/uhQdx4ZAupProtesters in House Chamber protest the democratic process by which bills become law, and by which Americans get to keep more of their own money.

I'm working with @SpeakerRyan, @RepKevinBrady &amp; @HouseGOP to make it happen. https://t.co/Jg8Me7HU7f"Most families in that income range would get a tax cut. Dems who spread this claim should delete their tweets, clarify they were in error." https://t.co/LlVWQ3Hjr4Glad to see this. We might have different approaches to policy, but we can't have our own facts. https://t.co/CMOinmeicoWell, at least it’s accurate.

The American people shouldn't suffer under an outdated tax code. https://t.co/eSZmeZ6u2HCount me in. Relief for families and businesses is vital to a stronger economy. This plan is the way forward. https://t.co/yDQ6mO7p3UHere we go. Tax reform. Let’s give relief to American families and businesses. https://t.co/N8zJqUMrfGExactly: This is going to be a boon for American families. https://t.co/Yh60DvxI0uAmerica is a country of great visionaries and innovation. https://t.co/eFAJJYVB2R"People will not look forward to posterity, who never look backward to their ancestors." https://t.co/LIEelNnsEjIt was a great piece, @RepStefanik, and I'm glad to be working with you to advance this legislation. https://t.co/tvMpFjrKYfCanadians are nice people. I'm sure they would be glad to go the extra 1.6km and abide by our U.S. customary units. https://t.co/UGtvdPtzzdNSFW. No, literally. An out-of-date tax code threatens working people. https://t.co/5ArGv19YzJWe should welcome older and retired Canadians who winter in the warm climates of our southern states. Here's a way.
