More: https://t.co/Lnt6IhP7gP1. I voted for the FY19 Defense Approps bill. A critical bill for our national security and servicemembers.

Please call my District Director Felix Ungerman at 402-938-0300 to discuss this.The inability to compromise hurts our country, security, DACA youth, and legal immigration, and diminishes the view of Congress in the eyes of the American people. We should expect more. I certainty do. In this case, perfection was the enemy of progress. https://t.co/Ci15n3KACXI supported the Border Security &amp; Immigration Reform Act that ensures families are not separated and provides a permanent solution for #DACA youth. It combats asylum fraud, provides funds for enhancements to border security, and transitions us to a merit-based immigration system.@Orsuna22 On the contrary... I’m a cosponsor of a net neutrality bill.@JimLangevin is great bipartisan colleague in Homeland Security and the Armed Services Committees. Securing our infrastructure against cyber attacks is necessary, and this bill lays out clear cyber authorizes for DHS. https://t.co/Bjn7vg66zT2/2 We must ensure that our military bases in Europe are not dependent on Russian gas. In a crisis, Russia can turn off the energy supply and put our Forces at risk. I hope my colleagues will put American national security interests first and reject the Huffman amendment. https://t.co/bwAokTHCOC1. The FY19 defense appropriations bill will provide funds to start replacing the 57-year old OC-135 aircraft flown by our Airmen at @Offutt_AFB.

And much, much more...2/2 A major housecleaning is required now. No criminal investigations should ever be tainted by political bias.1. The IG report revealed that at the highest levels of the FBI, officials displayed unprofessionalism, political bias, and untrustworthy conduct. President Trump was clearly right to fire Director Comey. U.S. citizens expect much more from our preeminent law enforcement agency.@d20jarrod There are multiple good options and my bill doesn’t dictate any specific solution. I just know it’s not wise for Euro bases to depend on Russian gas when they are there primarily to deter against Russia.The new and improved LEOSA Reform Act will allow our law enforcement officers who have given their lives to protect our communities, to continue doing so by extending their concealed carry privileges. TY @RepRutherfordFL and @RepScottPerry for your support of this legislation!The LEOSA Reform Act makes improvements to current law by easing burdens and restrictions on carrying for current &amp; retired law enforcement officers. These professionals are in every community and completed extensive training to properly handle a firearm. https://t.co/pFDsP5Dp9oIt’s foolish to make our military installations dependent on Russian gas when they can simply be turned off. I also don’t think it’s wise to use U.S. tax dollars to prop up Putin’s economy. In a time of crisis, we don’t want to depend on Russian gas. https://t.co/mUmZmIv8HzI had the opportunity to attend the unveiling of the #VeteransCreed.
