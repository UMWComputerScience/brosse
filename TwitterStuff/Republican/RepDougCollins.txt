I've advocated for a bicameral, bipartisan committee focused on repairing the process &amp; lowering the nat'l debt. This does that, giving spending &amp; debt reduction a viable path forward in both houses.Grateful for the opportunity to consider how to improve public safety and lower recidivism rates through solutions like the #PrisonReform and Redemption Act. https://t.co/VL7bE5VopsThe digital age demands our vigilance in protecting the privacy and the safety of American citizens.

Republicans are moving for transparency as Congress conducts Constitutional oversight. @FoxNews @HappeningNow https://t.co/FppPNUU22MThe Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act is what it says—a much needed policy update that provides consumers with better nutrition info and business with the flexibility to serve their customers better.

That's why I introduced the Prison Reform and Redemption Act. @BretBaier https://t.co/lkVikHit7uGlad to see the @EPA delaying implementation of #WOTUS rule for 2 yrs while it looks for ways to reduce regulatory burdens.

Check out his response: https://t.co/hP7Js7WEPy @FoxNews https://t.co/6AM8pHwV8yHouse Judiciary hearing will consider the #MusicModernizationAct this Friday. Questions about what it does and who's on board? https://t.co/ucXHOBWi6jI just voted to fund our government, #CHIP, and our military—again. Why? Because Democrats walked away from a bipartisan bill that serves American citizens to focus on non-citizens. That's the story of the #SchumerShutdown.Join me at noon on @FoxBusiness to talk about the #SchumerShutdown—the one in which Senate Democrats refuse to pass a #CHIP extension that saves taxpayer $ and helps 14,791 #GA09 kids access health care.232,050 kids in Georgia rely on #CHIP, which I voted to fund for the next 6 years. Join me on @FoxNews at 7:30 this evening to talk about the #SchumerShutdown and what it means for children and troops.As part of the @AirForceReserve, I find the #SchumerShutdown disturbingly irresponsible. Our military men and women deserve our immediate and unwavering support, which the House demonstrated by voting this week to fund our defense. https://t.co/FDvjboqNPS#SchumerShutdown feels more and more like a shakedown. Who are the losers? Children on #CHIP, men and women who serve in our military, their families, Americans at large . . .Democrats shut down the govt to protect illegals last night. Just to be clear, American troops and the children relying on #CHIP didn't make the cut on the Dems' top priorities. #SchumerShutdownWhile Democrats shut down the govt to protect illegals this week, @HouseGOP voted to keep the government open, support our troops, fund CHIP for 6 years (saving taxpayer money), and protect vulnerable newborns from infanticide. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/lk4yOW6SifThanks to @ShannonBream on @FoxNews for talking about the consequences of refusing to fund our troops. How can Dems say they're being honest about real world problems like North Korea when they're not willing to provide funding for our military service members? #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/6EzVw8DjwtLooking forward to joining @ShannonBream tonight at 12:15. https://t.co/wo3GFZQF9cHouse Republicans voted to fund #CHIP for 6 more years, but children relying on this health care program apparently aren't a priority in the brave new world of a #SchumerShutdown. #prioritiesLet's break down the question of a gov't shutdown. Senate Dems are using the 60-vote #cloture rule to hold American troops and children hostage. Those who support the #SchumerShutdown have some explaining to do to, well, every American. @HouseGOP https://t.co/K9aco7qiakChildren born alive during an abortion attempt are particularly vulnerable, and they should be guaranteed the medical treatment due to any other newborn. #HR4712 #prolife @March_for_Life https://t.co/AC6u5pPgX7Join me on @FoxNews with @JonScottFNC shortly to talk about keeping the government open.The House has a #ProLife bill, HR 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, on the floor today. Here's why I'll be voting yes. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/oG1Ad0fz2nI'm not sure what Democrats are calling "crumbs," but here's what the millions of dollars businesses are pouring into their employees as a result of tax reform mean to #GA09. #gapol https://t.co/OrlxyI54BJMy team is excited to welcome U.S. military veterans in #GA09 to a special benefits fair next week.

America needs statutes that address information security in an increasingly digital and global age, and it’s up to Congress—not the courts—to make smart policy improvements in this space.When did funding #CHIP for 6 years become a "doggie-do" sundae? Didn't Pelosi say "Congress has no more sacred duty than protecting the health of our children"? Is it supporting our troops or keeping the govt open that makes extending CHIP so noxious to her now? https://t.co/F1vP72Q9imCheck out the witty wisdom from #GA09 #FirstResponders who are keeping us safe (and entertained) in tough weather conditions. → https://t.co/kc2TvKoyOxCongrats to @NorthHallHigh on their first-ever wrestling state championship! #GA09 https://t.co/93kOYZ29udNothing like talking to a #GA09 neighbor to brighten a day in DC.
