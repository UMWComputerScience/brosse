Today it’s CVS announcing raises and paid parental leave. https://t.co/WeKewYZe46Combating the drug crisis takes all of us working together, and the members of @CADCA play a critical role. I had the honor of speaking to more than 3,000 CADCA members today about my legislation to stop pill mills and doctor shopping. @gregpuckettwv @MaryBonoUSA https://t.co/9pLdhItX3i.@SenCapito highlighted how WVians are benefiting from tax reform &amp; the five-year CHIP reauthorization in a great speech today. Under the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act, WVians are seeing more money in their paychecks. Thanks, Sen. Capito, for your leadership. https://t.co/6j25Be5LqDI met this morning with Richard Baum, acting director of @ONDCP. ONDCP is making a real difference in the drug crisis, and I’m leading the charge to fund this critical agency. We need programs like ONDCP to help West Virginia fight back against the scourge of drug addiction. https://t.co/7L0v0rDOwcIt was an honor to join @POTUS at the White House last night and speak with him about WV priorities, including the importance of funding our military. While at the White House, I met a West Virginian serving proudly in the U.S. Army, Sgt. Maj. Jason Burkhart of Hedgesville. https://t.co/tzUcQSFXwqI just joined my colleagues in sending the Senate a bill to fully fund our military and community health centers. Now I'm off to the White House to talk with President Trump about West Virginia's priorities. https://t.co/FLRepXK83lLater today, I’ll be talking with President Trump about supporting our nation’s military and community health centers. Thank you @POTUS for inviting me to join you at the White House tonight. https://t.co/RrX3yhPogBThe babies at @LilysPlaceWV aren't Republican or Democrat, but they are suffering through the horrifying aspects of withdrawal. No one should be attacking Lily’s Place because they were featured in a White House video. @wchs8fox11 https://t.co/L2epKLkrSKTax reform is good news for West Virginia’s hardworking men and women. The Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act I helped pass in Congress means over $50 million less will be taken out of state employees’ paychecks in federal taxes. https://t.co/yDOte3uZwYCongratulations to a great American and true hero. Once again, Herschel 'Woody' Williams does us proud! @WoodyWilliams45 @HWWMOHF https://t.co/r4psuieMqWThis @BDTOnline editorial is absolutely right! “The King Coal Highway is critical to the future of southern West Virginia. The sooner construction can begin on additional segments of this vital interstate corridor the better." https://t.co/eL9y4wvy7HGood words from the @heralddispatch today on @LilysPlaceWV. These attacks are disgusting, immature and vile. Lily’s Place shows how a community can come together to fight the opioid crisis. https://t.co/1nv90YAqIAI read the memo once it was made available to members, and I called immediately for it to be made available to the American public. This is a matter of transparency and accountability, and Americans can now read the findings for themselves. #ReleasetheMemo
https://t.co/w2HCPWsZ1fI’m going to bat for West Virginia each and every day. Investing in our roads, bridges, water and broadband infrastructure will create jobs here in West Virginia. That’s why I support President Trump’s infrastructure plan. https://t.co/F0BmLWdTHXVery enlightening talks today from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Secretary Mattis focused on how we can promote peace through strength, while Secretary Chao highlighted how infrastructure investment will grow our economy. @SecElaineChao https://t.co/PcCl9YVSHyAnother day, another business announcing bonuses thanks to the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act! This time it’s @Lowes, who will be giving employees bonuses and increasing their benefits, thanks to tax reform. https://t.co/TxjRGLNIevPresident Trump is here with us in West Virginia. #MAGA @POTUS https://t.co/2cZJGBmqpZWorking with @POTUS, @WVGovernor has turned our state from one of the slowest growing economies into one of the fastest. Gov. Justice is working with us to bring more jobs to WV. I was honored to introduce our governor with @SenCapito to our colleagues at our policy conference. https://t.co/aGasz6l2exI was proud to stand with @VP in West Virginia today as he shared how tax cuts are putting money back into the pockets of millions of hardworking Americans. https://t.co/8eehAXEYsaI stand by @VP @POTUS in their efforts to make WV and our country great again. Saying Sen. Manchin voted no on tax cuts for West Virginians isn’t partisan, it’s the truth. Washington only sucks when members vote against their state’s interests.Mr. Vice President, it's an honor to have you in Greenbrier County today. You and President Trump have my support as we work together to create jobs and make America great again. @VP @POTUS https://t.co/QFHY8Zfxg0Honored to be here at Worldwide Equipment in White Sulphur Springs with CEO Terry Dotson. Vice President Pence will be arriving shortly! @VP https://t.co/HO3cEnVeZxI was not on the train headed to the GOP conference in Greenbrier County; I'm in Charleston right now. My prayers are with my colleagues and the driver of the truck hit -- praying that everyone is OK.President Trump outlined a bold path forward in his State of the Union address, one that will invest in our country and improve our national security. My thoughts on the State of the Union address: #SOTU @POTUS https://t.co/5ut0HCsBvJ"We have ended the war on American energy -- and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal. We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world." President Trump #SOTU @POTUS@VP @POTUS @SenCapito Thanks to yours and President Trump's leadership, we are truly making West Virginia and America great again! Welcome back to Almost Heaven, Mr. Vice President!I’m honored to welcome Vice President Pence to Worldwide Equipment in White Sulphur Springs tomorrow. I proudly voted last month to pass landmark tax cuts for all Americans, and I’m working every day with @POTUS &amp; @VP to create more jobs and opportunities for West Virginians. https://t.co/rfwx1MBZhUThis would have been Huntington native Carwood Lipton’s 98th birthday, and we honor his life and memory today. May we never forget the sacrifices made by veterans like Carwood so we can live free in the greatest nation in the world! @DonnieWahlberg https://t.co/uMwyPJw5xUI’m looking forward to hearing more from President Trump tonight about this $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan and how it will create jobs. What projects would you like to see included in a infrastructure plan? https://t.co/zIuXkK4Ne1I called on the House Intelligence Committee to #ReleasetheMemo, and today, they voted to let the public read this memo for themselves. https://t.co/XkZVXaipWdThe brave voices of 156 athletes who testified against Larry Nassar made it clear how much the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act is needed. I am proud to stand with these survivors and voted today to pass this important bill.Nancy Pelosi said this about tax reform: “If this goes through, kiss life on earth goodbye.” I guess she doesn’t want companies investing billions in America, creating jobs, and giving bonuses and raises to their employees! https://t.co/2KsRJ192USWhen President Trump visits West Virginia this week, I’m looking forward to hearing more from him about his infrastructure plan to invest in West Virginia’s roads and broadband. What do you want to hear? https://t.co/hXxBgqXIEQI look forward to welcoming President Donald Trump to West Virginia later this week. This will mark President Trump’s third visit to my district in the year since he took office – what an honor for West Virginia! https://t.co/b9jPnZg8KKIt's game day in Morgantown! Go Mountaineers! #PressVirginia #CountryRoads https://t.co/0jyHuVtC7mI had the opportunity to join the Milton Rotary Club for their monthly lunch at Shonet’s. It was my honor to be able to recognize Lessie Moses of Milton, a 98-year-old Rosie the Riveter. https://t.co/NYjNqFRimAMore good news thanks to the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act – FedEx is giving out raises sooner than planned, plus bonuses. Tax reform works! https://t.co/BCJeiqa9HOCan't think of anyone more deserving than my friend Woody Williams! @HWWMOHF @WoodyWilliams45 https://t.co/YQvOVEW2PjI met with state legislators in Charleston to update them on the good news about the King Coal Highway. I also shared with them how I'll be fighting in the coming year for policies to help West Virginia. Thanks to @RepMcKinley for organizing this productive meeting. https://t.co/t0SklCz6AsWith President Trump's commitment to building up our nation's infrastructure, this is our chance to get the King Coal Highway done for the residents of southern West Virginia. Watch my interview with @wchs8fox11 for more on a major hurdle cleared for this highway project. https://t.co/rvCOlDOzSaTax reform is putting more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans! Home Depot is just the latest business announcing bonuses for employees thanks to the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act. https://t.co/Ja9xHxak0tAccess to fast, reliable broadband internet service is vital to diversifying West Virginia’s economy and providing more jobs for Mountaineers. I’ll continue to work with President Trump to help us expand broadband so we can invest in West Virginia. https://t.co/KHb55DB21bAfter reading the intelligence memo, I am very deeply concerned and troubled about how the FISA process was used. I’m calling on the House Intelligence Committee to make this memo public for Americans to read for themselves. #ReleaseTheMemoI’m heartbroken to hear of the passing of one of Huntington’s leaders, Chief Joe Ciccarelli. He cared passionately about making Huntington a better, safer place to live. My deepest condolences go out to his family, friends and fellow officers. https://t.co/fQeW3lu5oYOn the 45th anniversary of Roe v.

It is our responsibility to stand up for the unborn who were made in God’s own image. https://t.co/kGo56PYpBaSenate Democrats chose on Friday to vote to shut down the government, but today, they decided to stop holding children’s healthcare, our military and the nation hostage. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/a4BeMylJlJThe House voted months ago to reauthorize CHIP, only to have that bill stall out in the Senate. We've sent them another CHIP reauthorization, which is being held hostage thanks to the #SchumerShutdown. When will Senate Democrats get on board? https://t.co/b9i5kf9E1xDemocrats own the #SchumerShutdown. They’ve said no to policies the American people want and the American people need. Washington is broken. We need to get back on track. https://t.co/Jv9B375OHeSen. Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats are putting politics before what's best for America. Don't believe me? Here's what he said just a few years ago. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/p7ayCrKZiy.@SenCapito, @RepMcKinley and I have a message for @SenSchumer: Work with us to reopen the government. We sent you a bill to do just that and to provide healthcare for children in need -- a program you support. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/b8V0dJVXSZAs long as our men and women in uniform are not receiving pay for their service to our nation and my constituents are not receiving the services of the federal government, I will not accept any pay for the duration of this shutdown. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/a2PPeIWwwuThe #SchumerShutdown succeeded: Senate Democrats have voted down critical legislation to keep the government open, provide for our national defense, and reauthorize CHIP. https://t.co/DU6WEcVLC6There are 51 Republicans in the Senate, and it takes 60 votes to keep the government open, not a simple majority. That means Senate Democrats need to get on board to prevent a shutdown. They've asked for a CHIP reauthorization and the House has sent it to them -- twice. #WV3CHIPThat’s a total of 7,147 children in WV-3 who rely on CHIP. We have a solution in the Senate to protect CHIP. It’s time for a vote. #WV3CHIP @SenSchumer #SchumerShutdownWyoming County has 296 children on CHIP. #WV3CHIP @SenSchumer #SchumerShutdownWebster County – 100 children depend on CHIP. #WV3CHIP @SenSchumer #SchumerShutdownWayne County is home to 394 children on CHIP.

@SenSchumer #SchumerShutdownGreenbrier County is home to 580 West Virginia children on CHIP. This 6-year reauthorization will give these families much-needed peace of mind. #WV3CHIP @SenSchumer #SchumerShutdownFayette County – 641 children who rely on CHIP. #WV3CHIP @SenSchumer
#SchumerShutdownWe have 916 children in Cabell County who depend on CHIP. Cabell County includes my hometown of Huntington.  #WV3CHIP @SenSchumer #SchumerShutdownBoone County has 234 children enrolled in CHIP. #WV3CHIP @SenSchumer
#SchumerShutdownWest Virginia has 21,391 children who depend on CHIP. Every half hour, I’m going to highlight the impact of CHIP in each county in WV-3. #WV3CHIP @SenSchumer #SchumerShutdown21,391 West Virginia children depend on CHIP. That’s why I helped send the Senate a bill to reauthorize CHIP for six years – the longest renewal ever. Will Senate Democrats protect these children today? @SenSchumer #SchumerShutdownI'm headed to the floor to vote to keep our government open and pass the longest reauthorization of CHIP in the program's history. This is a vote for what's best for West Virginia. https://t.co/EH0DfyjSGpHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is telling her members to vote NO today on critical legislation to keep the government open &amp; extend CHIP for the next 6 years (longest reauthorization ever). https://t.co/As5gIbXdPIMore proof that the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act is working – Apple says it will bring money back to the U.S., pay $38 billion in taxes, and create 20,000 jobs. Investing in America pays off! https://t.co/7EfhYw5JHWSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer just called the House’s bill to reauthorize CHIP for six years “a loser.” Providing health insurance for WV’s children is a priority, not “a loser.” https://t.co/RRHicbh3LEMore good news thanks to the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act! Our economy is growing again after years of uncertainty and overregulation. https://t.co/6upEAuJdC6West Virginia’s families depend on CHIP, which is why I’m asking House leaders to include a long-term CHIP reauthorization in any government funding bill. I voted in November to help pass a five-year CHIP reauthorization in the House, but sadly, the Senate hasn’t taken action. https://t.co/tclAlXzdiGTax cuts are putting more money in the pockets of American workers and their families!
