https://t.co/KvI8Gx9ZPN@neilparekh_uww @UnitedWayBCKR @UnitedWay_SWMI @OttawaUnitedWay @AnnaMurphy66 Thx so much for coming in!UPDATE: Thank goodness this ugly practice is ending. As it should. Now we must re-double our efforts to fix a broken immigration system.@Malicedog I first released a statement on Monday: https://t.co/0zJ2aOhEGj@colbythegrey Yes - we'll look into this - thanks for letting us knowMr. President, you can stop this madness. End the ugly family separation practice NOW.#Taxreform has helped spur economic growth and investment for our nation‚Äôs manufacturing sector and enabled the build-out of more energy infrastructure.Since the passage of the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act, utility companies in 48 out of 50 states, &amp; DC, have taken action to pass their tax savings on to their customers. In my home state, several utilities have publicly announced their plans to pass on their savings to Michigan families.This is not just partisan political rhetoric - we are actually seeing the benefits of tax reform across the United States economy. Since the beginning of 2018, the country‚Äôs GDP has risen by 2.2 percent.The new tax law is the most comprehensive rewrite to the tax code in more than three decades. Across the country, its impacts on our economy are already evident, in the form of reduced tax burdens and more money in the pockets of middle class Americans.WATCH NOW: #SubEnergy hearing on the benefits of #taxreform on the energy sector and consumers -&gt; https://t.co/LXwvqrqDgoIt‚Äôs time for this ugly and inhumane practice to end. Now.

Enough finger pointing. Time for action and solutions. #MI06It‚Äôs never acceptable to use kids as bargaining chips in political process. For some time, I‚Äôve said that separating young, innocent children from their parents is the wrong approach. The right approach is legislation to address the root issues.It‚Äôs time for this ugly and inhumane practice to end. Now.Here's my statement on family separations occurring at the U.S./Mexico border: https://t.co/0zJ2aOhEGj@EmENickerson Statement here: https://t.co/0zJ2aOhEGjWhat a tremendous, tragic loss for our community. Lori was a wonderful mother, wife, &amp; friend. Her legacy of dedicated public service will live on &amp; for that we are all grateful.

Tune in &gt; https://t.co/EvoZOpfDCOMay marks #MilitaryAppreciationMonth. Thank you to all of our brave men &amp; women, &amp; their families, for their service &amp; sacrifice for our country. https://t.co/8DURXx8h1SThanks to tax reform enacted this year, we‚Äôve seen historic investment in our local economies, tax cuts, &amp; more money in worker paychecks. Now, with Opportunity Zones we‚Äôre seeing even more opportunities to build more businesses &amp; create more local jobs.In good news, The U.S. Treasury &amp; IRS recently approved the state of Michigan‚Äôs application for Opportunity Zones. Michigan was one of only 18 states approved. This first set includes cities and townships throughout Michigan ‚Äî 24 designations in #MI06 alone.Next, tax benefits are offered for reinvesting prior gains into Qualified Opportunity Funds. These funds must hold at least 90% of their assets into Opportunity Zone properties ‚Äì everything from a local startup to an affordable housing project.Here‚Äôs how it works: Governors identify a limited number of Opportunity Zones in areas most in need. States are required to consider local economic development initiatives &amp; successes with other programs to ensure Opportunity Zone designations equal LOCAL results.Despite these efforts, communities in Michigan &amp; across the country still lag behind in business &amp; job growth. It‚Äôs time for new innovative approaches to bring investment to these areas. That‚Äôs where Opportunity Zones come in.For many years the tax code has provided various tax incentives to encourage economic development in low-income communities. In my neck of the woods down in #MI06, local development groups have a strong track record of leveraging these programs to benefit our communities.Opportunity Zones are economically distressed rural &amp; urban areas eligible for tax benefits aimed at spurring private investment, econ growth, &amp; local jobs. The goal is to bring long-term, private-sector investment to the places &amp; people who need it most.ICYMI via @DetNewsOpinion -- ‚ÄòOpportunity Zones‚Äô on their way https://t.co/hdK7hxd0jR48 States, including Michigan, seeing lower utility bills following tax reform https://t.co/KVlbob0Dx9Great visit to the Coca-Cola North America Paw Paw plant yesterday.
