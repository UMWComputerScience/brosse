We are duty-bound to help our neighbors in need shift back to society. #SOTUThe opioid epidemic has a heartbreaking impact on thousands of our families. Out of the darkness of opioid and heroin addiction, there is  hope. #SOTUIn 2015, 392 Arkansans lost their lives to drug overdose. We're losing our friends, classmates, and family members to the grip of prescription drugs and illegal substances. We must continue to fight against drug and opioid addiction. #SOTUOur current immigration and border security issues have been inherited from past Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations. I'm committed to fixing our broken immigration system by securing our borders, enforcing our immigration laws, and reforming our legal immigration. #SOTUI agree @realDonaldTrump - "One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States." We must work hard to reduce high drug costs in our country. #SOTUI’m grateful that @realDonaldTrump and Congress are working together to roll back and rightsize Obama-era regulations that block Arkansan and American entrepreneurs’ ability to launch and grow businesses.Proud of our dedicated men and women in uniform who bravely defend our country every day, and for all those who have served in our nation's military. Thank you - you deserve our unwavering support! 🇺🇸 #SOTUWe worked hard to cut America's corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Since then, businesses are coming home, creating new jobs, and raising wages for hardworking Americans. #SOTU2018We've seen the biggest tax cuts and reforms in history after Congress and @realDonaldTrump worked together to enact #taxreform for hardworking Americans. #SOTULooking forward to hearing @realDonaldTrump deliver his #SOTU tonight. https://t.co/SHQ1dcrl2AThe American people deserve to read the FISA related memo outlining their investigation discoveries about the actions of the FBI and DOJ officials, and I’m glad to see the House Intel Cmte vote to make it public. #releasethememoGood to see @exxonmobil joining the growing list of companies bringing investment and jobs back to the U.S. since the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Visit https://t.co/QdfnvPvahm for additional updates on tax reform.Wishing my friend @SpeakerRyan a very happy birthday! 🇺🇸 🧀#WPS at #WarMemorial https://t.co/7naaaMqUAqThank you @academicsplus for the tour of your new school in Maumelle.

The 120,000 kids in Arkansas say thanks. #SchumerShutdownIt’s shameful that the other side of the aisle is using our men and women in uniform as political bargaining chips. https://t.co/hlUYnBtSgc #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/lcR3tEWfP5#SchumerShutdown https://t.co/WnhTGUOZY6@SenSchumer, check your facts. The most days of a government shutdown were a total of 57 days over the course of 4 years during the malaise presidency of Democrat Jimmy Carter with Democrats controlling both the Senate and House. #SchumerShutdownIn pursuant to a letter I sent with @RosLehtinen, @RepCicilline, &amp; @RepTedDeutch and 71 other members, I’m happy to see @VP discussing the persecution of Coptic Christians and religious minorities in Egypt. https://t.co/TWcYh0Lt8NGood to talk to @kwelkernbc on @MSNBC about the #SchumerShutdown.

Vote for cloture at 10 p.m. #SchumerShutdown@seanhannity, you're right - we need to #releasethememo. I read it today and I believe the American people would greatly benefit from reading it.The surveillance memo regarding FISA abuse prepared by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence should be declassified and released to the public, so that all Americans can read it. #releasethememoThe @WorldBank’s extravagant and unaccountable spending practices have been in conflict with the values of Arkansans and Americans for far too long. I appreciate @RepAndyBarr and @RepHensarling's leadership on this critical legislation that passed the House. https://t.co/UWGTvKXwsvMore good news due to #taxreform.
