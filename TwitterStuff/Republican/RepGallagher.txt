Thanks to @ATWairport's continued growth, @airwisconsin is expanding its operation and creating dozens of new jobs. https://t.co/njFlo4JtFmToday’s conversation is just one of many that I will be having with the administration, and my colleagues in Congress, to help prevent Northeast Wisconsin from getting caught in the crossfire of any trade disputes.The health of our economy in #WI08 depends on local farmers and manufacturers being able to sell their goods abroad and on a level-playing field. This is why we should be working with our allies to open markets and get tough on countries like China who cheat the system.I also urged Ambassador Lighthizer to continue pushing Canada to get rid of its unfair trade barriers on our dairy products.During our meeting, I urged the administration to re-consider any policy changes that risk forcing great Wisconsin companies, like @harleydavidson, to produce less in our state and more overseas.THREAD: Today I met with @USTradeRep Robert Lighthizer to share directly the concerns our farmers and manufacturers in Northeast Wisconsin have over the state of tariffs and trade in the U.S. https://t.co/VLSnu20ZhEAmerica stands proudly alongside the Iranian people as they challenge their corrupt and tyrannical regime. https://t.co/24Jbf15rap.#PerkinsCTE is critical to addressing the skilled worker shortage we face in WI and nationwide, which is why we passed it over a year ago in the House.

And yes, that means cancelling the August recess if necessary.Congress has a constitutional duty to legislate and fix ambiguities in the law, secure our borders, and protect those with legitimate asylum claims in the land of the free.These sweeping policy changes that occur with each new administration are the result of Congress, over the course of decades, ceding too much of its lawmaking power to the executive branch.In just ten years, we have swung from one end of the pendulum to the other; from catch-and-release to needlessly separating children from their parents at the border.Proud to see our community working together in the fight against the opioid crisis.

From the bottom up, what are the best solutions we can come up with? What can we do in our own communities here in Northeast Wisconsin to help solve this crisis? https://t.co/r1fhkC9IU0A year ago this month Otto Warmbier died. He was killed by the Kim regime. I’m not naïve. I recognize that sometimes we have to talk to unsavory people, but future negotiations should minimize pageantry &amp; maximize focus on KJU’s abysmal human rights record.https://t.co/bXl4PDi3tfMan I hope I’m wrong. I want @POTUS to succeed. Toward that end I’ll be pushing Congress to 1) play an active role in the negotiations; 2) reject any deal that doesn’t achieve CVID; and 3) ensure US forces in SK continue to be an enduring force for peace and stability in NE Asia.5) Of course media and many politicos are drowning in hypocrisy if you compare their past positions on Iran and Cuba. But to be intellectually honest, those of us critical of the Iran deal must also apply the same standards to these negotiations.4) A year ago this month Otto Warmbier died. He was killed by the Kim regime. I’m not naïve. I recognize that sometimes we have to talk to some unsavory people, but any future negotiations should minimize pageantry and maximize focus on KJU’s abysmal human rights record.3) Our presence on the Korean Peninsula is non-negotiable and should not be a part of denuclearization. KJU must be made to understand his regime’s survival depends on dismantlement. It’s not easy but it is simple.2) While the suspension of our military exercises is easily reversible, we shouldn’t be stopping any joint exercises with our allies. These exercises are important to countering China’s regional aggression, in addition to Kim Jong-un's hostility.In fact, a few things seem obvious causes for greater skepticism:
 
1) Any drawn-out process plays to North Korea's and China’s advantage, as it saps energy from the maximum pressure campaign and allows Kim to create pressure for peace at any price.But unless the subsequent Pompeo-led negotiations compel the Kim regime to make new &amp; concrete concessions, count me a skeptic when it comes to whether yesterday’s agreement advanced the ball down the field toward CVID in any meaningful way.We all want to see the North Korean crisis resolved diplomatically and the administration deserves enormous credit for the maximum pressure campaign. In the last 16 months alone, @POTUS has designated more North Korean entities for sanctions than in the previous 8 years.BIG news for #WI08. @GreenBayPkging announced a $500 million expansion project, the largest single business development project in Brown Co history. The new facility will add 200 new jobs and will be home to the first new paper mill in the US in 30+ years.
https://t.co/uffAgm5ApJThe key to tomorrow's #SingaporeSummit is being willing to walk away if it’s clear that Kim Jong-un is not willing to fundamentally change his country and commit to denuclearization.

As a new member of the committee, I will work as hard as possible to ensure Northeast Wisconsin’s transportation and infrastructure needs are addressed with responsible and common-sense legislation.
https://t.co/Rs8khF0edf.@POTUS deserves credit for walking away from this summit. All too often, negotiations with rogue regimes create self-fulfilling pressure to reach a deal at any cost. As I said in April, it's time to recommit to a campaign of maximum pressure against Kim. https://t.co/xqrqpLYk47In just two months from now, we will once again adjourn for a month-long recess without getting our work done. This is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues: let's cancel the recess, stay in session, and do our job. https://t.co/9eLl9QrKhWImportant piece that underscores the need for congressional reform.

Through both limiting our screen time and thinking twice before we hit send on that comment we wouldn’t want our parents to see, we can all play a more positive role.I understand the irony of saying all this on Twitter (and candidly, this is something I struggle with). While I value the role that social media plays in helping me hear from and connect with #WI08, I also know it can help drive the ugly and divisive discourse we see too often.This report reminds us that now more than ever, we need to set down our phones and computers, and have more meaningful conversations with our friends, family and community.In the digital age, we’ve seen historic growth in connectivity. So why then are people—especially younger generations—feeling so alone? This report begs the increasingly important question of the role played by social media and the internet in our nation’s mental health crisis.“The overall national loneliness score was alarmingly high at 44 on a 20-to-80 scale, but the prevalence of social isolation among those ages 18 to 22 raises even more concern." https://t.co/1NeFZhk2SUEstablishing term limits would be a complete paradigm shift.

As @SpeakerRyan put it in his new op-ed: "...more money and less hassle." https://t.co/hlpucgnpXfMost importantly, the new tax code allows families to make choices on how they spend their money, rather than laundering their money through special interests in Washington, D.C.

On #TaxDay next year Wisconsinites will pay taxes under the new code with: lower individual rates, a nearly doubled standard deduction, an expanded child tax credit, and a lot less hassle. https://t.co/ENzBxObSVmThis week I want to ask you guys about congressional reform and other efforts to “drain the swamp.” Watch below for some of my initial thoughts and questions, and let me know what you think in a reply. Look forward to following up with everyone later this week. https://t.co/u6t73wqGqaI appreciate you guys stopping in to talk more about programs that support healthy lifestyles and our agriculture community. https://t.co/2ko9v94fM1Some of our nation's most innovative companies are located in places like #WI08, and they have a vital role to play in strengthening our national defense. HR5517 is key to helping increase supply chain security &amp; bring local innovation into our defense industrial base. https://t.co/aoaQdGi0zB"This time next year, Americans will file under a new, modern tax code that catapults our nation's competitiveness forward." New op-ed from my colleague @RepKevinBrady ↓ https://t.co/LkTUEHE4kNIn light of last night's strikes, I'm re-upping my @foxnews interview laying out my thoughts on Syria. https://t.co/ssnDnABqMuA big thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts, opinions, and personal stories on the mental health crisis video I posted earlier this week. Here are my follow-up thoughts: https://t.co/e6rDtCN1R6Honored to participate in Safe Haven's groundbreaking ceremony in Shawano as it begins expanding its shelter for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Its effort to make #WI08 a safer place to live is inspiring, and is a true testament to the goodwill of our community. https://t.co/gacjxXpa2dAs we learned from the Obama Administration, there are costs to inaction in Syria. I spoke with @BillHemmer this morning on @AmericaNewsroom about those costs and why we can't make the same mistakes again. @FoxNews https://t.co/UcuXxwPnWwCOMING UP: Joining @BillHemmer on @AmericaNewsroom to discuss the escalating situation in Syria. Tune in to @FoxNews at 9:40am ET.Lots of innovation and entrepreneurship coming out of #WI08! Congrats to this team of students from @LawrenceUni whose idea for the "WellBell," a wristband device for emergencies and wellness alerts, won first place in yesterday’s The Pitch competition. https://t.co/9Gdk7SgUBQMany of you have expressed specific concerns on school security in #WI08, and I agree—keeping students and schools in our community safe should be paramount. Here are some of my thoughts after attending today’s @HouseHomeland briefing on securing our schools: https://t.co/Ftt76LkMBwMy full statement on @SpeakerRyan: https://t.co/0oRTtg7yqXI look forward to voting on the Balanced Budget Amendment tomorrow, a measure I've long supported. If we’re ever going to confront the institutional problems affecting Congress &amp; drain the swamp then this is one of the most basic steps we should be taking. https://t.co/oHIt4FJagoJoining @hughhewitt at 7:35 AM ET to talk news of the day.

With 75% of kids owning smart phones these days, it's critical that they understand internet privacy and how to better protect themselves online. https://t.co/RSFQFo4t1ZYour #GhostFleet article of the week is a must-read look at China's comprehensive technology transfer strategy. Protecting our technological superiority is now one of our most vital national security imperatives. https://t.co/BOT6vIuWT0We've seen time and time again in our history that when we fail to lead abroad, it actually endangers our safety and drags us in to unnecessary and costly wars over the long term. https://t.co/IEEp75ZZb1As I wrote in @RCDefense this week, Putin's kleptocratic regime is uniquely vulnerable to sanctions on the oligarchs who profit from corruption. Today's actions are an important step in pushing back on Russian aggression. https://t.co/5vP0OLQ6ZL https://t.co/dSNZzPc4PIGreat to sit down with @USGLC at @FoxValleyTech discussing the importance of American leadership abroad and its benefits here at home in #NEWI https://t.co/b5MtbSEZsRToday we pause and reflect on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Rev.

Looking forward to working on a strong 2018 #FarmBill that supports Wisconsin farming and timber. #FarmBillFriday https://t.co/OVLUczENjoExcited to see @GovWalker taking advantage of a provision in the #TaxReform bill that allows for the creation of Economic Opportunity Zones in WI— a tool to revitalize some of our most distressed communities. He announced 120+ zones throughout the state, including in WI-8. https://t.co/kxnKtOyehzRussia can't help us solve problems -- it instigates them. Just this week, reports highlighted how Russia-based Kaspersky exposed a longstanding US counter-terror cyber op. This isn't the behavior of a government that takes fighting terrorism seriously. https://t.co/x1aXNPaXHgI'm deeply concerned with how the insolvency crisis will impact the thousands of Wisconsinites depending on their pensions for retirement. This is why I’m urging action to find a fiscally responsible solution that keeps the promises made to our seniors. https://t.co/wWmWZODCGzAccording to a recent report, the multiemployer pension program is expected to be insolvent by 2025. As a result, over 10 million Americans and thousands of Wisconsinites will receive benefits significantly lower than their promised amounts.Joining @hughhewitt at 7:35am ET to talk news of the day. Listen live here: https://t.co/LRh7xagb5KFor too long our farmers have been paying into the MPP without getting the results they need. As Congress begins debating the #FarmBill, we must work to make the program more effective in meeting challenges farmers face in an increasingly volatile market.
 https://t.co/f9c99Ccu7ZThis misguided logic threatens to undermine readiness. The BBA only came about because we were able to educate our colleagues on the readiness crisis. Pretending everything is okay doesn’t make our military more ready—but it does make it less likely Congress sends reinforcements. https://t.co/hE9ALZiXsJHappy #NationalAgDay! Thank you to our hardworking farmers &amp; ag producers in Northeast Wisconsin who work hard each and every day to put food on our plates. https://t.co/iAB0dhnkUdA great look at some innovative changes taking place in #WI08 to improve health outcomes. https://t.co/iUDSHi0G4VICYMI: I joined @EricShawnTV on @FoxNews yesterday to discuss Mike Pompeo as the next Secretary of State, and the upcoming meeting between @POTUS and Kim Jong-Un.

Best of luck! https://t.co/LsD4tCaSSB.@FLTonetteWalker and I have committed ourselves to promoting trauma-informed care because we believe it has the power to help improve the lives of children and families across Wisconsin. Please read and share our op-ed below to help us raise awareness. https://t.co/wlLxclf787Honored to be presented with an award this morning for my support of community health center funding. These centers are absolutely critical to the 24,000+ people in Northeast Wisconsin who rely on them for healthcare. https://t.co/c4GZ7tq9pjMore than sixteen years after 9/11, a new @DeptofDefense report shows we're at war in seven different countries. It is long past time for Congress to review and update the legal framework through which we conduct counter-terror operations abroad. https://t.co/nwQsX3MPufCheck out this blast from the past.

Thanks for coming in! https://t.co/b5UvmS7ar9Joined @hughhewitt this morning to discuss terrible @Browns trades, Tillerson's odyssey (complete with Homeric references), &amp; North Korea diplomacy. Also challenged @connorlamb to a pullup contest.Great to see trauma-informed care starting to gain national attention. We need to continue raising awareness of the incredible power that TIC can have in helping people overcome trauma and lead healthier lives. https://t.co/QI8jfLd5JdSad to see @JordyRNelson leave. He's a class act who will always be a part of the Green Bay community. https://t.co/cVHh0AlaqyThank you to the staff and patients at @FreseniusKC center in Kaukauna for taking the time to meet with me. It was great learning more about the quality care patients in Northeast Wisconsin are receiving at your facility. https://t.co/fuk4yOuqBJ.@SecAzar is spot on; prices are available for almost everything EXCEPT our own healthcare. This is why @RepPerlmutter and I have introduced price transparency legislation-- a critical step in helping lower costs, improve outcomes and increase competition in healthcare. https://t.co/j7TIbPZ2lYThe @DeptofDefense has had it backwards recently; it is precisely because of the scale of the challenges before us that transparency is more important than ever. I worry that by failing to discuss problems, we will only ensure there is no public pressure to fix them. https://t.co/XPCCo81DZpLegislation must be brought to the floor as soon as possible to renew the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund before it expires in September. It's not just vital to our economy, but also to our way of life in Northeast Wisconsin. https://t.co/cj5ikiki7QICYMI ↓ https://t.co/jF47cXrRKxCongrats to Liam Herbst of @sb_schools on earning a FULL tuition scholarship to Iowa State. That's incredible news. Keep up the great work!
https://t.co/TM1t6lV6CmHere’s what it looked like from aboard the @USCG cutter Mobile Bay. Every spring cutters Mackinaw and Mobile Bay clear paths for shipments of fuel products going to the Port of Green Bay. https://t.co/eD9G8Ws5PyI had the honor of spending time aboard the @USCG cutter Mobile Bay last week to see firsthand the process of clearing paths on Lake Michigan. Their work is critical to keeping commerce moving on the Great Lakes during winter.
https://t.co/w8xGxcmIt3We need to adjust course instead of potentially decimating local industry in Northeast Wisconsin, like our beer producers and dairy farmers who could effectively be unable to sell their products abroad.Rather than punishing the Chinese like they were intended to do, I’m afraid these catch-all tariffs will hurt hardworking Wisconsin families and businesses.These tariffs will also have downstream impacts on other Wisconsin goods—from our manufacturers, all the way to beer cans. Early estimates show the tariffs will cost the beer industry over $300 million... a cost that will be passed on to the American consumer.As history has shown—as recently as 2002—this type of indelicate protectionism rarely, if ever, works. Already we have seen the EU threaten reciprocal tariffs on Wisconsin goods, such as dairy and cranberries.I have serious concerns with the administration’s overly broad tariffs on steel and aluminum, which is why over 100 of my House colleagues and I urged the President to reconsider this decision.Great discussion today. Thanks for stopping by, @PFFW! https://t.co/uD5Zh42I0UTrauma-informed care is really starting to gain momentum.

Tune in! https://t.co/LRh7xagb5KToday, we heard Sec. Mattis' starkest warning yet about the dangers of failing to fund our military. After the House once again passed full-year defense spending, it is up to my colleagues in the Senate to act decisively to give our troops the resources they need.Sec. Mattis ends with a stark warning to @HASCRepublicans: "Congress must take action now... I ask that you not let disagreements on domestic policy continue to hold our Nation’s defense hostage."As we debate government funding this week, I hope my colleagues keep in mind Secretary Mattis' warning to @HASCRepublicans: "We all know America can afford survival."More Sec. Mattis @HASCRepublicans: "Congress mandated this National Defense Strategy—the first one in a decade—then shut down the government the day of its release."Sec. Mattis @HASCRepublicans hearing: servicemembers "are putting themselves in harm’s way, in effect signing a blank check payable to the American people with their lives. They do so despite Congress’ abrogation of its Constitutional responsibility to provide stable funding."Happening now → Chairman @RepMcCaul delivers the State of our National Security Address at @gwcchs.

This failure is unacceptable and we cannot continue this constant cycle of careening from one budgetary crisis to the next.I’m disappointed by Senate Democrats’ reckless decision to do the opposite and hold all our nation’s priorities hostage to DACA—an important issue, but one that should be negotiated separately.Two days ago in the House, we did our part to keep the U.S. government open, and work toward an agreement that will get us out from under budgetary dysfunction.Your #GhostFleet article of the week is from the remarkable new National Defense Strategy, which finds, "Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security." https://t.co/JGyy1tdwFLLast night we voted to fund the gov't for just 28 days. Whether or not the Senate votes to shut it down, it's irresponsible for Congress to go home for 9 of them. We should stay here and get our work done for the American people.

Lock us in the Capitol until we do.Could not agree more @SpeakerRyan. As the @DeptofDefense said in its FY18 budget request, "Years of budget cuts and budget uncertainty have led to a depleted military and it will take a number of years to undo the damage."

We need to get this done. Our troops are counting on us. https://t.co/BeLL2xpYSYPowerful piece on the heroin epidemic that is destroying families, communities, and lives in Wisconsin. This is a must-read. https://t.co/NWuM5x3m9o"...the strongest quarter since 2010 and underscoring a resurgence in manufacturing that’s primed for further advances." This is excellent news for manufacturing districts like #WI08. https://t.co/TG952a7cPkJoining @hughhewitt now.

Praying for Kasey Vang, her family, and her safe return home. https://t.co/aqMDt69PXaProud to see Bay Shipbuilding hard at work on the Winter Fleet. Small and midsize shipyards like Sturgeon Bay are critical assets for our industrial base. https://t.co/hjHQiqXEnnI will continue to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: end the partisan stall tactics, work together and pass a budget that does right by our constituents. https://t.co/bJvWWauWVLThis #MLKDay, let’s honor his life and legacy by breaking through the vitriol in today’s public discourse, and restoring civility and humility to both our words and actions. https://t.co/TfWalAZP4bThis is a good example of how China uses economic power for coercive political ends. Growing Chinese assertiveness will raise, not reduce, the costs of doing business in China. https://t.co/vcMx5ksCqCThis week my bill that seeks to strengthen the United States’ counterterrorism efforts passed the House unanimously. I sat down with @DCDailyNews to discuss the details of the legislation.

This constant cycle of careening from one budgetary deadline to the next is irresponsible &amp; embarrassing. Only in DC is a basic task like keeping the lights on considered such a difficult achievement. https://t.co/RCPUOBOYrMProud of what my office accomplished for #WI08 in 2017. Don't hesitate to reach out and let us know how we can serve you! https://t.co/XcjCFVv605 https://t.co/xlOoOyPbjCIn the face of increased terrorist threats at home and abroad, my bill is a common sense step toward streamlining information sharing between federal agencies and the military. https://t.co/kWcsIPlSiwHappening now: speaking on the House floor, urging my colleagues to support my @HouseHomeland bill, the Counterterrorism Information Sharing Improvement Act. 

Watch live here: https://t.co/fpZOBkitPDThank you to the brave men and women of law enforcement for all you do to keep our communities safe. We are grateful for your service and protection. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/ZoNvnr9u7bThe shortage of skilled trade workers in the US is concerning. This is why I sponsored legislation that helps strengthen #CTE programs, and helps workers in Northeast Wisconsin succeed in these in-demand, high-skilled jobs. https://t.co/wte1Kxuym3Thank you for having me! I look forward to coming back. https://t.co/jNuhm0C5qz
