ACA RELIEF. Finally, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we were able to repeal the crippling "individual mandate" embedded in the Affordable Care Act. This was a totally unfair tax, it was ineffective, and people shouldn't be forced to buy government-mandated health insurance.3. The new tax code doubles the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000, which helps people all across the country care for their family, while also protecting the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and Adoption Credit. This is great news for families.2. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act nearly DOUBLED the standard deduction. Specifically, the new tax code will increase the standard deduction from $12,000 to $24,000 for married couples, which will protect more folks' income from being taxed. #TaxDay #TaxCutsandJobsAct1.

The West Shore flood control project was in the STUDY phase for 42 years before proposed for construction.  And construction still hasn't started.The fact that we call the Mississippi River bridge that was built before I was born as "new" is the best indicator that something needs to change.There is no doubt we need more money to support infrastructure in the capital region but we can't keep spending money in the same system that got us to this point.Brand new four lane roads in areas that don't have traffic don't make sense when there isn't enough investment in the capital region - some of the worst traffic in the US.The current infrastructure prioritization system in place today is flawed. Project development needs to be metric based and objective.We don't have years of infrastructure investment to catch up on. We have decades.Tax reform - not just important for take home pay, but also making the US more competitive in the international marketplace. https://t.co/i1w79Lg5mSWe're changing the game. For every one regulation, we're cutting two. While we're changing the game and setting conditions for success, we have to ensure our workforce is prepared to compete.More investments are returning home.

√ Eliminate “Duplication of Benefits” prohibition on grant funds for flood victims
√ Provide several hundred million dollars for Louisiana to build back stronger
√ Tax relief for flood victims
√ Path to COMPLETE the Comite flood prevention project https://t.co/05zwHvm5ihCritical relief for Louisiana disaster victims on the way.  https://t.co/XOI9IJn8NiIn addition the bill includes a change that may result in a small increase in coastal restoration and hurricane protection funding for Louisiana by amending offshore energy revenue sharing law.La wins in the bill: our flood and other disaster victims get the tax breaks we’ve fought for all year long, we preserved tax incentives uniquely critical for community development, historic preservation, economic reinvestment and higher education.Finally, this bill helps eliminate the strategic advantage that foreign companies hold over America’s small biz by providing competitive tax rates. It provides opportunities for Americans by creating jobs here in our country not overseas and helps to increase $ for our families.This means that Washington takes less while individuals, families and job creators keep more. That’s a good thing! https://t.co/j2OJIbKbwXThis bill will lower taxes across every income tax bracket, nearly double the standard deduction and give people back their freedom to make healthcare decisions without having to pay a government-imposed penalty and lifting some of the tax burden on our small businesses.Today I voted yes on "game-changing" tax reform legislation that finally puts what’s best for people – not government – first https://t.co/6ZrrZHIXPnPassage of these landmark policy changes represent major movement toward regional flexibility, tailored management strategies that favor local over federal control, better data collection and enhanced responsiveness to the needs of recreational anglers and mixed use fisheries.Our Modern Fish Act and two other common-sense amendments were also approved Wednesday as part of broader committee action to reauthorize and modernize the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the fishing law of the land.This bill will also preserve existing commercial and charter fishing protections under current law and further protect the average angler’s ability to enjoy fresh red snapper at home or in a favorite restaurant. https://t.co/dyWgp5Fsw8This bipartisan bill is intended to give every day Americans a more sustainable access to saltwater fishing than current restrictive model and is conservation- based to allow states to work with fed fishery managers to expand access 25 miles or to a depth of 150 ft into the Gulf. https://t.co/dyWgp5Fsw8Graves Advances the RED SNAPPER Act of 2017

The bill also funds a “surge” of building inspectors to help address permitting and assessment activities that typically delay rebuilding and recovery.The DRRA establishes a new program where rebuilding and recovery efforts can include resilient construction to help prevent repetitive losses and to prepare for future disasters…The amendment also makes food banks eligible for FEMA repair assistance.T&amp;I unanimously adopted our amendment requiring FEMA to more closely collaborate with food banks like the Greater Baton Rouge Area Food Bank, St. Vincent de Paul, and Long-term Recovery Groups like Rebuild Louisiana, Samaritan’s Purse, and others.It’s important to invest federal dollars in projects that will prevent these disasters from happening in the future.Like the Comite River Diversion Canal. #DRRAOur amendment also clarifies the flexibility to states and local governments to complete MUCH needed flood mitigation projects…For example, the DRRA will eliminate the very flawed “duplication of benefits” policy that prevents LA flood survivors from gaining Restore LA grants.Several of mine and Congressman Richmond’s policies were included in the bill…The DRRA represents an important move toward the federal government taking a more proactive approach to disaster preparation, relief and recovery which is something that I have advocated for a long time.Can better prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against floods, hurricanes and disasters of all kinds. #DRRAAnd It cuts through bureaucracies when disaster strikes so that families, individuals, small businesses, and state and local governments…This bill makes critical reforms to FEMA’s disaster response and recovery programs to provide on the ground help…Yesterday The Disaster Recovery Reform Act was unanimously approved by the Transportation and Infrastructure committee. #DRRAPresident Trump signed our FEMA Accountability, Modernization and Transparency Act of 2017 into law last week. We authored this bill last March in an effort to modernize the way FEMA administers assistance and responds to survivors.  https://t.co/7KnJxRNHUEalong with Lt.
