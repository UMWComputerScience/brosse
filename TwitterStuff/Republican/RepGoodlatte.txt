Next SCOTUS justice should have a true respect for the Constitution‚Äôs place in our system of government and the limited powers it grants.I'm encouraged that we have 223 Republicans willing to do the right thing, and now we need to do the hard work of finding the right combination of these two bills that can get a majority of votes in the House. #ImmigrationReformBetween the two immigration votes, 223 Republicans voted for legislation to secure our borders, restore the rule of law, reduce chain migration, and provide a solution for the DACA problem.#ImmigrationReform is a very complicated, difficult, and emotional issue. While the failure of two immigration bills in the House is disappointing, what is most disappointing is that not a single Democratic member voted for either bill.The @HouseJudiciary Committee needs to interview Strzok first, but there will also be a public hearing soon. https://t.co/lJz7jKNcuxWhat @PressSec experienced in Lexington last night is very unfortunate and doesn‚Äôt reflect accurately upon the kind and caring people of Lexington that I know.
