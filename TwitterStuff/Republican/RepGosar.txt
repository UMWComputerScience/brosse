Drilling and tooth extraction is surgery. No Med midlevel does surgery. This population of tribes and veterans deserve quality care not “any half assed care.” Agree to disagree on this.@TomJenneyAFP, my conservative street cred is beyond dispute. It’s not a “conservative” or “liberal” issue regarding dental therapists.  It’s a public health and safety issue. The dentists want highest quality dental care which comes with years of education. https://t.co/aHz1uhvOAfMy first read of the day.
