Join @MariaBartiromo &amp; me on @FoxBusiness @MorningsMaria in just a few moments. https://t.co/HhsCsiCKoPHappy Birthday to my great friend, @VP Mike Pence! https://t.co/wTAMm6BtrQMy iPad continues to be awash with reports that our national debt is unsustainable. This is just one more sobering reminder – something that is unsustainable one day stops. There is only one solution and it is to reform entitlement programs for future beneficiaries.Furthermore, for the first time in almost 40 years, Social Security’s cost will exceed its income. Both of these troubling reports are further evidence that as a nation we are continuing to spend money we do not have and we are passing the bill to future generations.We have two ominous events occurring because of failing entitlement programs. A new report from the Medicare trustees projects that the Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted three years earlier than previously reported.The Administration may be correct in claiming that the existing steel and aluminum tariffs have been helpful to some workers and jobs, but it’s hurt other businesses that use these metals. It’s going to be a tax on all consumers.Protectionist policies typically are another version of crony capitalism with the government picking winners and losers.I strongly disagree with the decision to move forward with the implementation of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Mexico, Canada, and the EU under the guise of national security concerns.It is my sincere hope that you will take time to reflect upon the service of our fallen heroes. On this Memorial Day and every day, I ask that you join me in praying for those we have lost and their loved ones. #MemorialDayThere are not enough words to describe how grateful I am to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice serving our country in the military. I am always reminded that freedom is not free, and it certainly cannot be taken for granted.I again call upon the President and his administration to exercise extreme caution and focus on the nation states that violate the actual trade rules and force transfers of our technology and intellectual property.All of the great gains President Trump has made with generational tax relief and bureaucratic regulatory reforms – the reforms that are fueling our economy – can be wiped out overnight if we end up in a global trade war.Trade laws designed to uphold critical national security measures should never be used as an excuse for raw protectionism.The Honda Accord is not a threat to our national security. However, taxing it with trade tariffs is a threat to the economic security of millions of hardworking American families.Thank you for your leadership, @VP. https://t.co/XH5pt7PRyTTune in to @BloombergTV now. @kevcirilli and I are having a great conversation about what’s next for @FinancialCmte &amp; what we are doing to protect community banks and small biz. https://t.co/5J15rFth4yJoin me on @FoxBusiness @MorningsMaria in just a few moments! We’re discussing Dodd-Frank and the Senate Banking bill.In about 5 mins, join me on @SquawkCNBC @CNBC. @JoeSquawk, @BeckyQuick, @andrewrsorkin, and I are talking about the Senate banking bill which will provide much needed relief for hardworking Americans &amp; community financial institutions. https://t.co/QhDBnIuocQGreat to be with @POTUS today at the @WhiteHouse as we roll back yet another Obama-era regulation. (Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead) https://t.co/bycJoMNOevGreat to be at the @WhiteHouse for the ceremony to overturn the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection's auto lending guidance. This rogue bureau harmed the very people it claimed to champion. We are working together to put an end to these unchecked powers. @POTUS @BCFPDirector https://t.co/x7zMQp8S4LIn turn, we are closer to making sure taxpayer money doesn’t ever indirectly fund abortions facilities. #TitleX #prolife https://t.co/0mA9PCpl3rThe Trump Administration is taking a big step to protect life by aiming to prevent federal funding for groups like Planned Parenthood that have their family planning clinics under the same roof as their abortion clinics.With the help of a fairer, flatter, simpler, and more competitive tax code, the American people are seeing more jobs, fairer taxes, bigger paychecks, and a healthier economy. #TaxCuts https://t.co/7MJqCXAPgpAs our friends continue to protect their heritage and future generations from adversaries, I wish our sister country, greatest ally, and U.S. Embassy the very best as they continue their work in the Holy City. #EmbassyOfFreedom @Israel @IsraeliPM https://t.co/8tHCT4pyoFThis is a powerfully historic moment in time. Along with the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s rightful and eternal capital, the dedication ceremony that took place is an enormous milestone in history not only for Israel but for America as well..@POTUS sent a clear message. He is ready to take a different direction &amp; put America’s nat'l security interests 1st. I stand by our President &amp; his decision to withdraw from the bad Iran deal &amp; seek a meaningful agreement w/ Iran that will ensure a long-term solution, stability.It is an understatement to say we cannot afford a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. President Obama made a dangerous agreement packed with serious shortcomings – it was a good deal for Iran and not a good deal for the American people.Most of all, Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. Furthermore, the deal is dangerously flawed as it expires and seemingly did not shut off Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon. A deal in need of a permanent solution was answered with temporary measures, and that is unacceptable.From the beginning, Iran has not followed the spirit of the so-called ‘nuclear’ deal. They call for the annihilation of our ally, Israel. They continue to develop and test missiles.Our economy is on the path to success, and I applaud @HouseGOP, @SpeakerRyan, and the Trump Administration for this accomplishment.Our economy is booming under President Trump’s leadership. With today’s announcement of the unemployment rate falling to 3.9 percent, we are seeing the lowest level of unemployment since the year 2000. In addition, the Labor Department reports show we have added 164,000 jobs.My family and I are praying for @DallasPD Officer Crystal Almeida, the @HomeDepot employee, and the loved ones of Officer Rogelio Santander after the senseless shooting that occurred near Lake Highlands. https://t.co/5k877mRVM9While she may no longer be here with us on earth, we can be certain she is with our Heavenly Father – her memory will continue to live in the hearts and minds of the American people.Barbara Bush had an unparalleled style and grace. Not only was she our First Lady, but a fiercely loyal wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother.Great read from @POTUS in @USAToday on #TaxDay. I couldn’t agree more: ‘America's economy is back and roaring and its people are winning’ https://t.co/S5BBfNPNcHThank you for having me on your show, @MariaBartiromo. In case you missed @FoxBusiness this morning, here is a clip of our conversation on @MorningsMaria. https://t.co/rE9jVUlEmWThis Tax Day is a historic one, as Congress and the White House successfully worked together to fix our broken system. #TaxDay https://t.co/CNpqBwVBsrConsumer confidence is up, jobless claims are down, and customers in at least 39 states are seeing lower utility bills. While some benefits will not be realized until next year, over four million people are already seeing bonuses in their paychecks.Next year, we will see the individual health care mandate disappear, 90 percent of Americans will see greater take-home pay, and the standard deduction will nearly double because of #TaxReform.While our citizens are still coping with the headaches and frustration of the outdated 32-year-old tax code, they can rest assured that a new day is on the horizon.This time next year, many Americans will be able to file their taxes on a form much simpler than the one they are having to deal with this tax season.Looking forward to speaking with you on @BloombergTV after the @FinancialCmte hearing today. Viewers, tune in around 3:40 p.m. ET. https://t.co/jPfHBSSv6DIn a little over 5 mins, I’m joining @MariaBartiromo and a panel on @FoxBusiness @MorningsMaria.

Barbara, your poise and kindness serve as an inspiration for people across the world.

He has been an invaluable member of @FinancialCmte – particularly on flood insurance reform – where I know his insight and dedicated service will be greatly missed.His contributions to public service will have a long-lasting imprint, and he will not be easily replaced. I will always treasure and value his friendship and look forward to the remaining tenure of his Speakership. Thank you, @SpeakerRyan.I am so grateful for his leadership on many important issues – but most especially reforming our tax code and showing the way to save our nation from bankruptcy through innovative entitlement reform.I am very saddened to hear the news today that @SpeakerRyan will not be seeking re-election. He is one of the great conservative leaders and visionaries within the Republican Party, and truly an intellectual tour de force.Join me on @MorningsMaria on @FoxBusiness in a few minutes. I’m speaking with @dagenmcdowell about today’s hearing with the Acting @CFPBDirector Mick Mulvaney.It took 60 Senate votes to fund our military but it only takes 51 to cut the wasteful spending in the omnibus. I highly encourage GOP leadership to bring forth a robust rescission bill immediately. https://t.co/CnWrC9PjUaI applaud the administration’s plan to utilize the National Guard at the border – our citizens’ safety absolutely must come first. While America is a nation of immigrants, those seeking entry must respect the rule of law. @POTUSAs any Texan can tell you, our national borders are not secure enough. After so many years of failure with our country’s immigration system, it is refreshing to see the Trump Administration take bold action to protect our national and economic security.From my family to yours, Happy Easter.

I urge the President to be surgical in his approach and limit any action to what is absolutely necessary for our national security. #tariffsThe last time steel tariffs were imposed, it cost American jobs. I’m already hearing from constituents who fear this will seriously harm their businesses. I applaud the President for working on better trade agreements, but the imposition of wide-ranging tariffs...President Trump’s first year in office has been one that invigorated the economy with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and regulatory reform, but I urge the President to exercise extreme caution here as these tariffs could affect some of this economic growth.Did you hear the latest positive economic news?
