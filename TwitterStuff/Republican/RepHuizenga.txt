We continue to communicate with them to stay up to date as the situation develops. This must change! https://t.co/8zmrzUvh42The Admin must end the policy of separating children from their families immediately. If it is unwilling to do so, then the House should immediately pass narrowly tailored legislation to end separations. There  is broad bipartisan support to put an end to this inhumane policy.What is happening at the border is heartbreaking. I'm committed to leading a bipartisan, bicameral effort to find a humane solution that ends automatic separations and keeps families together. Tonight’s meeting with Pres. Trump provides an opportunity to work towards a solution.Happy 243rd Birthday to the @USArmy!

https://t.co/xICbOqun3eNobody denies dealing with the DACA situation is important, but literally putting our national defense and fully funding our Govt for the year on hold, as Pelosi advocates, is a huge mistake.4 hrs into Govt shutdown and Nancy Pelosi takes the floor to advocate denying our troops their much needed resources until she forces a vote on DACA. Huge mistake holding our troops hostage by voting to delay this bipartisan funding bill. #PelosiShutdown https://t.co/G7Vxv5eXVjI'm happy to see bipartisan support for my legislation (The Mortgage Choice Act) that passed the House today to help low &amp; moderate income families attain a QM while experiencing the benefits and convenience of one-stop shopping. https://t.co/7yOgzHMIyqCongratulations to Lucas on being named the next #Gerberbaby!

There were 5 Dem votes for the last solution, not including either of our Mich Senators. Not House or POTUS. Again, #SchumerShutdown.@erowekamp @WOODTV See above... NEEDLESS SHUTDOWN.@slefebreHHS @WOODTV As you know, the current Senate rules require 60 votes for spending bills. The House sent ALL of the spending bills to the Senate in September and a stand alone CHIP bill in Oct but the Minority Leader refused to allow a vote.  Now we find ourself in a NEEDLESS shutdown.@rfischer @WOODTV With all due respect Ross, this is a completely NEEDLESS shutdown caused by the Senate Minority  leader who can deliver the votes. We are dealing with DACA (which expires in March) but it is more important to keep the Govt open &amp; our military funded NOW. Hence: #SchumerShutdownGoing live on @WOODTV at 6pm to discuss the #SchumerShutdown and my hope for a solution.@brooksblanton @SpeakerRyan even the New York Times and Bloomberg see this for what it is  #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/aJwWKz0haw@randybuist @MLive Wrong. It happened multiple times under the Carter Administration. #SchumerShutdownHere are simple facts:
@HouseGOP passes 5yr stand alone CHIP bill Nov 3, 2017. All Govt funding bills voted out of House by Sept 14. ZERO action by the Senate due to Sen Dems &amp; 60 vote rule. Now, CHIP expires &amp; military sequestration hits. DACA? Expires March 5. #SchumerShutdownThe #SchumerShutdown has occurred... still waiting for action.Very disappointing votes cast just now by Michigan’s two senators. This was a moment for real leadership in keeping the government open. Instead they chose to play politics and follow the #SchumerShutdown playbook.So pleased to see @ConsumersEnergy is passing along 100% of the tax cut benefit to its customers.
