Proud to celebrate #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek #mn02Joined .@LizClaman to discuss positive steps in the Senate to end the #SchumerShutdown. Looking forward to Democrats joining me in funding the govt and #CHIP #MN02 https://t.co/WgwEupNbNXAbout to join @FoxBusiness to discuss the shutdown and the Senate getting back to work — tune in ! #Mn02#TaxReformBonuses in Burnsville ! Great to see this happening for #Mn02 https://t.co/kXw5bTya9dKeep an eye on the roads &amp; follow any travel advisories, stay safe #MN02 https://t.co/zeAu7ydmNYSenator Schumer just objected to the Senate taking another, compromise vote to fund the government. Almost as disappointing as the #Vikings game. The #SchumerShutdown continues #MN02#Skol go #Vikings! #BringItHomeOur Minnesota delegation frequently works together in a bipartisan manner- and we can all get behind the #Vikings! 

Now we just need the rest of the Democrats in the Senate to join the House in supporting #CHIP and funding the federal govt by ending the #SchumerShutdown. #MN02 https://t.co/wi8TbO6NKKI'm still working hard in DC to end the #SchumerShutdown while our Vikings are in Philly defending the North Star State and getting ready to 'spam' the Eagles! Skol Vikings!

https://t.co/NNTVR2TNaG #MN02In his own words... #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/jhdXfEfp9CHere's what's happening in the #SchumerShutdown- the media are recognizing that #SenateDemocrats blocked government funding and #CHIP. Hopefully Democrats will come work with us instead of keeping the government shut down and playing amnesty politics with #CHIP #MN02 https://t.co/YBP5meJ7HiTHANK YOU to our Capitol Police who work hard every day to keep us safe. Thank you for your service to this community and for being here during an unexpected weekend of voting.
#MN02 https://t.co/qwb5cHdChoUPDATE FROM DC- I'm here and ready to work if #SenateDemocrats decide they are ready to join me in supporting CHIP, and end the #SchumerShutdown #MN02 https://t.co/7lyG7jshYjThe NYT actually has it right - Senate Democrats blocked passage of this bill to fund the govt and fund #CHIP #MN02 this will be a #SchumerShutDown https://t.co/VivZWaSEnTAt 10pm ET tonight, we will see if Senate Democrats will block funding for the government and children’s healthcare. The families of the millions of kids on CHIP will be watching #Mn02I’ve told you repeatedly about my concerns over unwarranted FISA wiretaps (one reason why I voted against reauthorization). Now after reviewing classified intel memo regarding possible abuses, I am more troubled than ever. Transparency demands that we #releasethememo. #MN02I’ve voted 4 times to support the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Yesterday I voted for a SIX-YEAR reauthorization of CHIP, with a ‘clean’ CR funding the govt. Almost every Democrat voted against.

Senate Democrats refusal to join will lead to a #SchumerShutdown #MN02#SchumerShutdown - Senate Democrats have the balance of power here and should use it to support CHIP and govt funding. https://t.co/lnLidgfoGMWe need CHIP and responsible government funding… Senate Democrats won’t give us either. #SchumerShutdown #MN02 https://t.co/vfLZvDFuX9Even if every Republican in the House and Senate voted 'yes' on the CR &amp; CHIP, it wouldn't be enough to pass.

In that case, NINE Senate Democrats would still have to also vote yes.

Don't forget the filibuster rule greatly affects GOP 'control' of the Senate #MN02I want a deal on DACA and think there's a sensible compromise to be reached. The DACA deadline isn't til March. Government funding and CHIP need to be reauthorized TODAY. Senate Democrats need to decide whether they will shut the government down over immigration or not. #MN02Important note for #MN02- the GOP doesn't have 60 votes in the Senate. This bill requires 60 votes. Democrat support is needed to reach 60 &amp; fund CHIP, as well as the federal govt. I just voted to fund #CHIP and the govt, and call on Senate Dems to follow suit https://t.co/KCS3sWuEJ7My statement on supporting govt funding and the Children’s Health Insurance Program — if Senate Democrats want to vote ‘No’ on a bill that needs 60 votes, they will be responsible for shutting the govt down. #SchumerShutdown #MN02 https://t.co/AwriDIoNkqGreat to speak to our seniors from #MN02 about the impact of tax reform and to take questions on social security and medicare on my recent telephone townhall! https://t.co/GRAr2GZqBI#Skol ! https://t.co/jseA2fxwP4Joined @TeamCavuto to show my support for the @Vikings and make the point that responsible government funding should not be held hostage to immigration debates #Mn02 https://t.co/K1glI3S01UGreat to be on with you talking govt funding- and of course, the @Vikings ! #MN02 https://t.co/UkwXmY5gd8Reminder that @BobbyScott and I are working hard with my friend @ChuckGrassley to get Juvenile Justice Reform passed through a House-Senate conference!
