A highlight every year is seeing folks from the SC Children‚Äôs Hospitals during their visit to Washington. Thanks for meeting with me this week and sharing your stories! https://t.co/Iapo0xRyhDGreat to see so many folks in #SC03 yesterday to celebrate the retirement of Sonny Kinney after 34 years of service with NHC. Congratulations, Sonny! Thanks for all you have done! https://t.co/cC4xRjvaGmCongratulations to this year‚Äôs #SC03 Congressional Art Competition Winner, Elizabeth Moody! Elizabeth‚Äôs excellent piece of art will be hanging in the U.S. Capitol for an entire year. I hope everyone has a chance to come see it! üñåüé® https://t.co/Onr4o9K1IsJustice Gorsuch‚Äôs nomination shortly after President Trump was sworn into office was nothing short of a complete victory for the Constitution, and I am confident that the President will select someone of similar legal qualifications and values to replace Justice Kennedy.Nominating justices to the Supreme Court is one of the most important responsibilities of any president. In fact, it is alarming exactly how important the courts have become in recent years ‚Äî often attempting to legislate from the bench and overstepping their bounds.Another great day for freedom! #1A #SCOTUS https://t.co/X0L4OwCVOMThe fact that Democrats are rallying around candidates running on abolishing immigration enforcement in this country shows just how far removed they are from mainstream America. Americans do not want open borders.Strong words by Justice Kennedy from today's ruling on National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) v. Becerra.  California‚Äôs law was mean spirited, vindictive, and disrespectful to all those who believe in the sanctity of life. https://t.co/NbPuhuEYWlHUGE win for free speech today! #NIFLAvBecerra #SCOTUS #GiveFreeSpeechLife https://t.co/WdfkI7zxXKHuge wins at the Supreme Court today regarding the President's travel ban and protecting freedom of speech for pro-life pregnancy care centers.

If they spend the month confirming the President's nominees, I believe that would be time well spent, and a huge benefit to the President's agenda and the country.‚ÄúThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc.

We will always remember the bravery and courage. https://t.co/iGHgafDzAbThis is the right thing to do, and I hope the Senate follows through on their plan. There are 503 House passed bills sitting in the Senate waiting for a vote, along with hundreds of judges and executive branch nominees that still need to be confirmed! https://t.co/oECX82FMrZ@CoryTruax I also can't help but think that had this been a 7-2 ruling in support of an issue they were generally more agreeable too, that it would have been pitched much differently.@CoryTruax I understand the scope of the ruling. I also know that oftentimes people just read the headlines. The Post wrote a terrible headline, and they aren't alone. They could have written something clearer, one that referenced a consensus ruling with a narrow scope. They didn't do that.Since when are 7-2 Supreme Court rulings considered "narrowly" decided? When the court rules in favor of Christians and religious freedom? When the mainstream media disagrees with the ruling? What gives @washingtonpost? https://t.co/1HCWHCKAQbIt's always a good time at the Laurens Electric Co-op!

Hoping to inspire!Isn't it amazing that some in government care more about what President Trump says about MS-13 gang members, than they do about combating the gang itself? I for one am glad President Trump isn't in the business of worrying about offending rapists, murderers, and criminals.@MaryCaitlinByrd and "requires players to stand if they are on the field during the performance."I have no idea why it took the NFL so long to adopt this common sense policy, but I'm glad they finally got the message from the American people. https://t.co/xDseuHUGuG@JustinRakey Posted about it on facebook this morning.

There are so many questions related to the Clinton e-mail investigation, and the FBI's probe for the Trump campaign that need answers. https://t.co/fIk0MF8iqSNancy Pelosi apparently supports putting law enforcement officers in danger, and wants to help people break the law.

Equally important is that it was negotiated separately from the upcoming talks, and that it didn't involve giving a dangerous country a plane load of cash.@docshanep Great! And good luck!President Obama had a responsibility to build a consensus on the Iran nuclear deal before moving forward with the agreement. He failed. Miserably. In fact, there were few issues that united Republicans &amp; Democrats in opposition to him than that particular agreement.If anyone's to blame for undermining US credibility abroad via Iran deal it's Obama. There was bipartisan opposition to the deal. He should have never moved forward with it. The American people can not be expected to honor a commitment that they never supported to begin with.This withdraw should be a cautionary tale for future administrations   seeking to bypass and disregard Congress while negotiating international  agreements. https://t.co/MaMJ8WqLYoPresident Obama brokered this agreement in spite of intense bipartisan opposition in Congress. The deal never had the support of the American people, and for the good of the country, President Obama should have never proceeded on his own.While I'm sure this decision will be met with disappointment by some of our  allies, their disappointment should be directed at the Obama Administration, not President Trump.The deal also gave valuable resources to the world‚Äôs greatest financier of terrorism, without any concessions from Iran on ending their nefarious activities. The agreement also lacked any real enforcement capabilities to ensure that the Iranians were living up to their promises.The Iran Deal broke decades of national security precedent by commingling the issues of prisoner releases and sanctions relief, endangering every American in the process.I applaud President Trump for keeping his word, honoring his promises to the American people, and recognizing that for the sake of international security, we can and must do better.In fact, the Iran Nuclear agreement was so poorly conceived and negotiated that the Obama Administration‚Äôs motives for entering into such an deal deserve questioning.At the end of the day, President Obama trusted the word of a rogue nation over the wishes of the American people. From its conception, the Iran deal faced extensive bipartisan opposition and lacked vision.@PersistentThorn Like this one? https://t.co/RX7M4e5t2RHad a great time in Oconee County this afternoon visiting with hundreds of constituents!

Still much more to do.I have read the Dem memo, and already said publicly that I support its release as well. I‚Äôm on the side of keeping the public in the know. https://t.co/pAEq2e8w4G@mythdebunker have I ever said who appointed the FISA judge? My concern is that the FBI withheld information from the judge when seeking a FISA warrant.@DocHeatherB It needs to follow the same process that this memo followed, but I've read that one as well, and I have no problems with it being released.This memo rightly shakes Americans‚Äô confidence in their government. The challenge will be conducting the proper amount of oversight, implementing the right reforms, bringing violators of the law to justice &amp; promoting an era of transparency &amp; openness to regain the public trust.Finally, there needs to be a discussion as to whether the Mueller investigation is truly needed, seeing that the main premise that launched the investigation turned out to not be credible and was both directed and funded by political opponents. #FISAMemoThe revelations in the memo necessitate the public release of findings related to the Clinton email investigation, and whether a new investigation needs to be launched to determine whether crimes were committed. #FISAMemoThere must be a review of past FISA warrants and unmasking orders to determine whether there are other instances of the government knowingly submitting faulty or biased evidence to the court in order to get secret warrants on American citizens. #FISAMemoThese revelations require an extensive response by all three branches of government. The Department of Justice along with the FISA court must determine whether crimes were committed by government officials withholding necessary information from the court. #FISAMemoThe entire basis of the investigation into possible collusion with the Trump campaign and the Russians, along with the corresponding media coverage, was based on false information spread by political and ideological allies to Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.By intentionally withholding vital information from the FISA court about source credibility, background, &amp; clear political bias, these activists within the government betrayed their oaths of office &amp; helped launch an entire false narrative directed at delegitimizing the PresidentIn this case we see tools that were intended to keep our nation safe become weaponized by people with a political &amp; ideological agenda.In a broader context, the memo confirms what many of us in Congress from both parties have said for years ‚Äî that the surveillance tools currently available to the government are susceptible to abuse and pose a risk to people‚Äôs constitutional rights.Corruption thrives when people are left in the dark, which is why I have always championed for transparency in government and why I felt so strongly that the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence memo should be released to the public.Remember to take this Memo in conjunction with who‚Äôs wife works for FusionGPS, the text msgs between FBI lovers, missing emails, tarmac meetings, Comey press conferences, who wrote Comey statement, McCabe‚Äôs testimony on FISA warrant, private servers, unmasking #ReadTheMemoAnd keep in mind Folks, American citizens who were incidentally caught up in this FISA warrant approved surveillance were subsequently ‚Äúunmasked‚Äù at the bequest of Susan Rice &amp; others - possibly violating their 4th Amendment rights.In reading #TheMemoIsOut one needs to focus on the names of the people who signed off, multiple times, on the FISA warrant requests which used the fabricated Steele/FusionGPS dossier as evidence to spy on an American citizen. #ReadTheMemo#TheMemo is out: https://t.co/HrDS9RumXw@MidnightRideYC He has been clear - waiting on an audit to be completed, lest you have a skewed opinion before it is complete.@AmeriWify @SaraCarterDC I think Wray is a good guy. But he, too, is institutionalized!  This looks like a CYA momentFBI Calling for names to be ‚Äúredacted‚Äù in ‚ÄúThe Memo‚Äù defeats the purpose of ‚ÄúThe Memo‚Äù in providing the transparency into the rogue actions of those named! Seems like FBI in total CYA mode after Wray read Memo
#Transparency #ReleaseTheMemo #AmericansHaveTheRightToKbow@GovMikeHuckabee @Earl26518683 And that, folks, is another reason we need a wall on the southern border!Having read ‚ÄúThe Memo,‚Äù the FBI is right to have ‚Äúgrave concerns‚Äù - as it will shake the organization down to its core - showing Americans just how the agency was weaponized by the Obama officials/DNC/HRC to target political adversaries. #ReleaseTheMemoGreat #TaxReform news keeps rolling in #MAGA #NotCrumbs https://t.co/2ePoYXVYQq.@TGowdySC will be missed both by the South Carolina delegation and by  his constituents in the Upstate whom he served with great distinction.  However, I know Trey will be just as successful and impactful in his next endeavor..@TGowdySC is an enormously talented interrogator and jurist who has helped reinvigorate the critically important oversight responsibilities of the legislative branch. He is the very embodiment of fairness and thoughtful deliberation..@TGowdySC has been a great friend and colleague since we first came to the House together back in 2011, and his retirement from Congress is a blow to the entire institution.One of the most powerful moments of the evening. There were tears in people's eyes. https://t.co/ILRabtiopc#MAGA https://t.co/5ESMwHLt7M@frere66 @ercitall @cspan Yep. I was. What is wrong with that?Simply put, he has put America first, which is something we had not seen in years. I look forward to working hand in hand with the President as we continue to Make America Great Again for each and every citizen of this great country. #SOTUI was also excited to hear the President take the closure of the terrorist detainment center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay off the table. This was an issue I have long championed because like the President, I believe that no state should become a terrorist dumping ground. #SOTUAfter eight stagnant years, President Trump has ushered in a renewal of the American spirit &amp; the American economy. The nation has greatly benefited from historic tax cuts, a booming economy, remarkable job creation, a  record-setting stock market, &amp; low unemployment #SOTUWe have someone in the White House who gets it - someone willing to move power from Washington back to the people where it belongs. #SOTUPresident Trump‚Äôs bold State of the Union address to Congress was an  excellent display of leadership and vision. It's refreshing to have a President who has made the people‚Äôs priorities his own and who resonates with the goals and aspirations of the country. #SOTUSorry man. Wouldn't wish being mistaken for a Member of Congress on anybody. https://t.co/van8xVsWW8@JaCoryC "The world's largest maker of heavyweight motorcycles has struggled to reverse a four-year sales slide, with growth overseas somewhat helping offset a decline in the U.S. bike market."Congratulations! https://t.co/PRmYAvVfkxIf these reports about former Sec. John Kerry actively undermining the US abroad are true, then his actions are incredibly unpatriotic at best, and a violation of the Logan Act at worst. https://t.co/cmcRp2G2qlTime to:

And
#ReleaseTheMemo

#MAGA@ladyluck_g pls call my office and ask for Thomas. My phone number is 202-225-5301. Hope we‚Äôre able to work it out and let us know if you need any help in DC.@swilliamssc1 @Win_Ott I do represent all. If you need help with a federal issue, I am here to help. I ... https://t.co/2hi83X8mxqMore #winning https://t.co/tjNvO20KET@swilliamssc1 I also received bipartisan support from the district for my vote against the FISA reauthorization. So I believe oversight of this issue is extremely important to many folks I represent.@swilliamssc1 many of my constituents are concerned about the memo. To put it in perspective, over the past few days my office has received more constituent messages on the memo than on the government shutdown.@JarrodWiggins Tell you what:  I will focus on
‚úîÔ∏èSecuring the border
‚úîÔ∏èEnforcement of the law
‚úîÔ∏èEnding Sanctuary cities
‚úîÔ∏èmaking sure legal status isn‚Äôt conferred to criminals
‚úîÔ∏èand then we can debate immigration reform in its entirety
While upholding the Constitution
#AmericaFirstNow that #SchumerShutdown is over, can we get back to #ReleaseTheMemo &amp; see how Obama Admin militarized govt agencies &amp; courts to target their political foes, violate Constitutional rights and sell a lie abt Russian involvement to the American people? #MAGA@TomCottonAR Well stated SenatorDems forced a #SchumerShutdown on Friday night, only to vote to reopen it today for practically nothing? They are playing with real lives and livelihoods here! American government doesn‚Äôt operate with an Open &amp; Closed sign hanging in the window.Day 3 of the #SchumerShutdown and @SenateDems still won't support funding for our military. https://t.co/ZSe2Kk7uk8@cbdharmon the Senate had a majority vote for the CR. Democrats filibustered. #schumershutdown@knoll_rob a majority voted for the funding bill. Would have passed if schumer wouldn‚Äôt have filibustered.@wamcmanus No, actually I work for the American citizens and lawful, legal residents. I pledge to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States and that means supporting the laws of the land. #SchumerShutdown is about Dems helping illegal non-residents.@PamWarrennn no. I‚Äôm a co-sponsor of a bill that grants them legal status in exchange for immigration enforcement reforms. Key is that Congress needs to do it, not the executive branch unilaterally like under Obama Admin.Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a vote in Congress. Chuck @SenSchumer Schumer does. #SchumerShutdown #OpenTheGovernmentChuck #ThisShutdownIsOnYouChuck #StandUpForOurMilitaryThe DACA program is illegal. If President Obama would have followed his oath of office, the program would have never existed. Presidents don‚Äôt make law on their own. A former constitutional law professor should know that. #schumershutdown https://t.co/fMmJsbEGCmPresident Obama created the DACA crisis by unilaterally creating an illegal and unconstitutional program without the consent or approval of Congress. Also, House Republicans funded CHIP months ago. This is a #schumershutdown https://t.co/769ivsVK0tThanks for reaching out, but what you failed to mention is that the funding bill managed to receive majority bipartisan support in the Senate. Only Schumer‚Äôs filibuster led to the #schumershutdown https://t.co/UpKDVcT9gs@PerryBullock yes and I support it being made available to the public.#SchumerShutdown @SenSchumer https://t.co/0YugU6l4Fv@studiocafebleu Ok! Well, actually we did!  The House-passed CR is actually a piece of legislation which the Senate failed to even bring up!  So how about directing you Tweets to @SenSchumer since it is his #SchumerShutDown@MichaelGunnSC So - you do realize that the House has been working on comprehensive reauth via E&amp;C Bill which is in this CR? Sure I care - about doing it right - not a rubner stamp
