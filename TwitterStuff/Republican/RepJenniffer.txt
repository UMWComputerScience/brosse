‚Ä¢ Y m√°s de $18 millones en actividad econ√≥mica.En Puerto Rico, las peleas de gallos ya son una industria de juegos altamente regulada. La Ley 98-2007, cre√≥ la Oficina de Asuntos Gall√≠sticos bajo el Departamento de Recreaci√≥n y Deportes de Puerto Rico.Hoy, me opuse tenazmente en el Hemiciclo Federal a la enmienda n√∫mero 28 que busca prohibir las peleas de gallos en los territorios. https://t.co/fB3OyTnFFXWe have not been given the opportunity to discuss nor debate this issue. My constituents deserve to be heard and, if there are any concerns, they should originate at a state level, according to what the people of Puerto Rico- which I proudly represent- decide.Additionally, an abrupt prohibition of cockfighting will transform a highly regulated industry into an underground industry, bringing back the fights to our streets where there is no control.The proposed prohibition of cockfighting in the territories would distress even more the economy in Puerto Rico by not only reducing economic activity and jobs, but also the revenues the government collects from licensing and penalties.These numbers may seem insignificant within the context of the Mainland, but in a depressed economy like Puerto Rico‚Äôs, $18 million is a significant amount.According to the latest statistics from the Puerto Rico Cockfighting Affairs Office, this industry represents:
‚Ä¢ Approximately 27 thousand direct and indirect jobs between 82 venues.
‚Ä¢ And over $18 million in economic activity, counting only the gaming side.Originally regulated in 1933, the industry is covered by local Act 98 of 2007, which created the Cockfighting Affairs Office under the Puerto Rico Department of Sports and Recreation, which issued Regulation No. 7424.This amendment is based on the premise of establishing more Federal regulation over activities in the territories.   In Puerto Rico, cockfighting is already a highly regulated gaming industry.Today, I rise in respectful opposition to amendment number 28 to H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, introduced by the gentleman from the 6th Congressional District of Illinois, Mr. Peter Roskam.I‚Äôll be on the @HouseFloor discussing my opposition to the amendment banning cockfighting in the U.S. territories. Follow along here: https://t.co/llqHS5neZiI want to congratulate the 75 students who chose to serve our Nation‚Äôs Armed Forces and whom we delivered certificates and were accepted to @USArmy @USMC @usairforce @USNavy @uscoastguard @NationalGuardPR #OurCommunitySalutes https://t.co/aDUfCTG5oIDecisions that are this important and delicate should not be subjected to guess work but be based on updated facts.  I also want to share that these amendments, as drafted, do not increase mandatory spending. https://t.co/88QxB1FAISAs PuertoRico‚Äôs sole Representative in Congress-it is my responsibility to make sure we have the tools at hand to collaborate w/state officials and make the decisions that will continue to help families maintain proper access to a quality diet &amp; therefore a proper quality of life https://t.co/xp2n3AKbljMy amendments essentially seek better facts and better data on the nutritional benefits my constituents receive and depend on. For many families on the island, this is the main source of nutritional assistance. https://t.co/A4Zl06GPBaAn updated study will allow us to have recent data to properly consider making this decision along with the Government of Puerto Rico.In view and preparation for this, we might start considering if a transition to SNAP is feasible and if so, what would it mean for my constituents in terms of benefits. https://t.co/fq5qAsV2JtAs approved in the previous Farm Bill, Puerto Rico‚Äôs cash portion of benefits obtained through NAP will gradually be reduced by 5% every year until 2021, when all NAP benefits will then be available through the Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) system. https://t.co/MgDs8BZxm6That report indicates the percentage of households that would receive nutritional assistance and what the average monthly benefit per household would be if Puerto Rico were treated under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). https://t.co/eAoct8ZvUAMy second amendment requests the Secretary of Agriculture to produce an update on a 2010 report previously generated by the Food and Nutrition Service Agency at the USDA https://t.co/sJEUN30600This will allow my office and the Department of the Family in PR, which administers NAP benefits, to make an educated decision on how to move forward in terms of acquiring benefits and addressing factors that reflect increases in the costs of food items found and purchased on PR https://t.co/z0YYoKlmd6My amendment requests the Secretary of Agriculture to produce a report on the feasibility and impact of Puerto Rico having its own Thrifty Food Plan. https://t.co/ASr4EDCAeIPuerto Rico is currently included in the Thrifty Food Plan of the 48 contiguous states. However, Puerto Rico imports most food items sold in stores, which increases the cost families pay when purchasing foods included in their diet.My first amendment aims to take a deeper look onto the Thrifty Food Plan and how it influences the amount of funds currently calculated for nutritional assistance block grant provided on the island through the Nutritional Assistance Program (NAP). https://t.co/uaHXvl4SveI‚Äôll be on the @HouseFloor soon speaking in support of my amendments to H.R. 2 #FarmBill. Watch here: https://t.co/llqHS5neZiGreat meeting today w/ BG Dustin Anne Shultz, Commanding General of the 1st Mission Support Command @1st_MSC.

I must urge FEMA and the Corps in the strongest terms to maintain intensity of effort. The job needs to be finished. https://t.co/uYE9qIIvV9I must request of FEMA and the Corps to extend the mission, so crews can remainon the job full time in ALL affected communities, until the system is fully restored and secured, and to ensure there are material and human resources in place for any contingency. https://t.co/mTPLnevrWUThe current electrical restorationmission through FEMA and the Corps of Engineers, and the contracts under it,expire this Friday May 18.  This is alarming when there‚Äôs only sixteen days until the next hurricane season. https://t.co/bE3UlQQbOLThe Federal support for Puerto Rico power restoration must continue until full completion.  We still have twenty thousand homeswithout service, mostly in hard to reach rural communities. Customers still have an unstable system that suffers massive blackouts. https://t.co/DS7zTJSRY6Great meeting today with the National Association of Realtors @nardotrealtor.
