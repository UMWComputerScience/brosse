I'm disappointed the Senate failed to include my amendment repealing the WOTUS rule in its farm bill. The Senate bill also lacked reforms to strengthen work requirements. I hope the conference committee addresses these provisions in the final package. https://t.co/YuSjo9d3sKWhile I’m glad to see Fort Wayne attorney Holly Brady is ultimately another step closer to a U.S. District Court seat, I am disappointed that Democrats on the Judiciary Committee would oppose her just because she is a Trump nominee. https://t.co/1lISGljHFECongratulations to Lt.

I pray for the victims and their families. It’s also a reminder of the important work journalists do every day in communities across America. Tonight we say thank you.Huawei’s leaders are worried that their efforts to infiltrate America’s intellectual institutions are being exposed. I’ll wear this personal attack as a badge of honor and stay focused on defending America’s national security. https://t.co/rnoiwVHYF4 https://t.co/PL1IH7ELewThe most important responsibility of Congress is to provide for the national security of our country, and I urge my Senate colleagues to follow suit and use regular order to fund our military before the end of the fiscal year. https://t.co/Jz8eZUNP0hThis week, I joined my fellow Hoosiers in Congress to share what tax reform means for families, workers, and small business owners across Indiana.

I’m grateful for the opportunity to serve on the bicameral conference committee as we consider this historic piece of legislation that boosts funding for our military and reverses Obama-era cuts. https://t.co/hJDkB50E8kSeveral important SCOTUS rulings this week with votes of 5-4 show the importance of having justices who will uphold the rule of law and the Constitution. With Justice Kennedy retiring, the American people deserve a justice in the mold of the late Scalia.  https://t.co/8ahZzZ69xe#Huawei feels threatened of exposure so this “lash out” isn’t surprising. Our intelligence community has been warning us for years of this snake in the grass. https://t.co/85J8VelLXfGreat to meet with new @FTWUL1 CEO Dr. Cosette Grant-Overton today to discuss how we can work together in #IN03. https://t.co/TJ36ZG5x9zMoving people back into the workforce and removing burdensome regulations are two important priorities for Congress. The Senate farm bill should strengthen work requirements and include my provision to repeal WOTUS like we did in the House. https://t.co/WKl3kmq24cDropping the @USArmy’s tuition assistance waiting periods will allow some of our nation’s bravest and brightest to pursue higher education opportunities. Ensuring our warfighters receive quality education will ultimately make our country more secure. https://t.co/KJFkmwrcHEOnce again, Indiana was ahead of the federal curve. Former Governor Mitch Daniels reformed government union rules in 2005. Glad that SCOTUS recognized the right of government employees to decide whether or not to pay union dues.

This bill would help nearly 90,000 blue water veterans who were exposed to toxic chemicals during the Vietnam War receive the benefits they deserve. https://t.co/KooE28iPF4All across northeast Indiana, I am constantly hearing good news as a result of tax reform. It’s no secret why this is happening – Washington is finally taking a page out of Indiana’s playbook. https://t.co/803AB1Zh5xToday we remember the #KoreanWar and honor those who fought for South Korea’s freedom @USForcesKorea. Thanks to the leadership of @POTUS, we look forward to bringing home the remains of the brave American soldiers who sacrificed it all during the war. https://t.co/SXvPeZaAm0A recent report on college readiness shows Indiana’s education reforms are working. More students are earning college credit in high school while the percentage requiring remediation is declining. Other states should follow Indiana's lead. https://t.co/VrxB952bUmWhen Congress debated tax reform six months ago we were told 3 percent growth was impossible. Now not only is it within reach, the U.S. economy could even exceed it. https://t.co/19tzkY0c2MEvery day, 20 veterans die from suicide.

It’s the key to our nation’s economic success, and it’s the reason that, six months into tax reform, Americans are more hopeful about their future.” @RepKevinBrady https://t.co/odefEOPsOOSix months ago #taxcuts were signed into law. Since then we’ve seen record economic growth https://t.co/Gp39BdXJT0The federal government should do more to help our veterans have a smooth transition to civilian jobs.

WOTUS gave unelected bureaucrats the power to broadly interpret what is a navigable waterway in a way where even a puddle could be subject to federal regulation. 2/4Today the House passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which included my amendment to permanently repeal the Obama-era Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. 1/4I’ll be live with @WOWOpatmiller in a few minutes.

The safety of our Hoosier children must be our top priority. (2/2)The alleged failure of Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers to protect minors from sexual abuse is horrifying and should be investigated immediately. (1/2) https://t.co/ZovBIJDc6hSchumer and the Democrats would rather play politics than work on a real solution. They’re pushing a bill that would prohibit the arrest of anyone with a child within 100 miles of the U.S. border, incentivizing human trafficking and illegal immigration to continue.We can enforce the law and keep families together at the Southern border with the Protect Kids and Parents Act introduced by @SenTedCruz — the bill would expedite hearings as well as double the number of immigration judges. https://t.co/qCUej8wpdvCongratulations @ParkviewField on becoming the first stadium to win the @ballparkdigest Best of the Ballparks fan vote twice.

Denuclearization does not happen overnight and we must continue pressuring the Kim regime until verifiable concessions are made. #TrumpKimSummit 1/3For the first time in over a decade, the House used the rescission tool to cut nearly $15 billion. Using this tool to do a targeted "spring cleaning" is the exact opposite of an earmark and a serious effort to cut wasteful spending. https://t.co/umI1mVve5d (3/3).@POTUS signed into law the VA Mission Act, which will provide more options and better choices for our veterans.

(3/3)As we work toward a solution, our nation’s immigration laws must be enforced both at the border and throughout the country, which means no amnesty, ending the visa lottery program and ending chain migration.  (2/3)Republicans are united in the belief that our current immigration policy is outdated, our system needs reformed and the border must be secured.
