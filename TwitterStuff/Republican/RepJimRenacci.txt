At a community level, we must make a priority to identify and treat mental health conditions.I saw @BetsyDeVosED asking to have an honest conversation, and Congress has to lead it, and I agree with her. We must stop throwing accusations across the aisle and start bringing in thought leaders to have hearings so we can fix this problem correctly… not politically.According to a poll by @NFIB, optimism among small businesses in the US rose more than forecast in January, close to November's reading, which was the highest in monthly data to 1986.

#TaxReformTuesday https://t.co/1AAksgbaY6As we continue to talk about budgets &amp; spending, shouldn’t legislators be informed about the fiscal state of our nation before making these decisions?

It kicks the can down the road on the debt ceiling by once again raising the debt ceiling w/out addressing the long-term drivers of our national debtThis legislation will bust through the funding caps without providing for a full offset in the increased spending. Over the next few years, our national debt will grow by hundreds of billions of dollars. 1/2 https://t.co/jRZvmrbSiM@MseverXRC @BradCromes @STERIS I pushed for permanent on both corporate and individual and then signed on to a bill to make it so.The easy path is to vote in support of increased spending even though I know that our country is on an unsustainable fiscal path.
