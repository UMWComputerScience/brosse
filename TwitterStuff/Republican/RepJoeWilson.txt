In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, &amp; unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.” #SOTULooking forward to the #SOTU! https://t.co/gri8MRUXDrCuba was one of Latin America’s wealthiest countries when Communists seized power, but now “the Castro regime- like any socialist government- is a machine of squandering subsidies.
