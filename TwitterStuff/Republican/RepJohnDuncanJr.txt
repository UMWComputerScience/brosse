It was so great meeting with Abby and Jack in my D.C. office today before votes to hear how Cystic Fibrosis impacts the lives of our young people. https://t.co/PTumLabDOxIt is really sad to see, hear, and read about all the hatred coming from the hearts and minds of many on the far left today. I hope you will read @PatrickBuchanan's latest column which is now on his website. https://t.co/NrEqClJTluI am so sad to hear of the passing of John Ward. He had such a positive influence on countless students, players, and fans during his over 30 years of broadcasts. My prayers are with his loved ones as we mourn the loss of such an iconic legend and fine Tennessean. @Vol_FootballIt was so great visiting with these awesome young people! I really enjoyed visiting with them and showing them around the Capitol yesterday. https://t.co/dhFy4J79WXAs we join together to celebrate the history of Our Flag today, I want to share information about a service my office provides to constituents.

Happy Flag Day! https://t.co/opsLsaIKSXI really enjoyed spending time with you all for this year's Safety Patrol in Washington. Hoping everyone has a great summer. https://t.co/VHNjBNiUv6@Ncrye1 Hi Neil- thanks for reaching out. I am excited for you and your wife to visit our historic Capitol. Please call my Washington DC office at 202.225.5435 and we will get you taken care of. Looking forward to hearing from you!I want to wish a very Happy Birthday to a Blount County resident, Roy Huskey, who is celebrating his 98th year today.  He served Our Nation during WWII and was wounded in action during the Normandy Invasion. Please join me in celebrating him. Happy Birthday Roy! #WWII #Veterans https://t.co/Umtnk7WLheI want to share this story about a Vietnam Veteran in my district who selflessly serves our community every day through his actions and prayers. I am so amazed by Lou Volk's passion for our neighbors and our lands.
https://t.co/6w7mwHyLfoThese students did such a great job for representing Farragut Middle for @KnoxSchools. I hope all of our East Tennessee students continue to learn and grow their skills.

I think he has done a good a job as anyone else in what has become an almost impossible role. I feel certain he will be called on to serve Our Nation on some other high level for many years.I always enjoy reading @PatrickBuchanan's articles. https://t.co/RQJdxcPHh9On Friday, I voted against the omnibus appropriations bill for many reasons.
I think it is ridiculous to increase federal spending when Our Nation has just exceeded 20 trillion dollars in debt. Our bloated government spending today increases the burden on generations tomorrow.I'm pleased that my colleagues voted to pass my bill that names a Foothills Parkway bridge after the late and great Dean Stone. He was a WWII Veteran who passionately advocated for the completion of this project. I wish he was here with us today to see this. @GreatSmokyNPS https://t.co/OxVbDNc2kkhttps://t.co/GtDPsyptn0I am so proud of my son, Zane, for authoring a tribute Governor @BillHaslam that appeared in today's @knoxnews.
