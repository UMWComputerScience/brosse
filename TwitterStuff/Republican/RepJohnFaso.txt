Another perspective on why this legislation is badly needed: https://t.co/znYbD1eP5vNew York’s Scaffold Law impairs Habitat for Humanity’s mission &amp; ability to build new affordable housing in our state. Today, the @HouseJudiciary Committee is scheduled to mark up my bill to make New York a better place for Habitat to perform its mission. https://t.co/2NUG8yYo80Ahead of infrastructure reform, I am working to make New York a more attractive place for federal investment. See why Habitat for Humanity of New York is supportive of my effort: https://t.co/6xFe12reLvRe-authorizing CHIP was a great step for New York families. However, we must continue to make bipartisan efforts to ensure New Yorkers have access to quality care by delaying #MedicaidDSH cuts and robustly funding community health centers.Join me before the State of the Union from 4-5pm tomorrow for a live conference event. I will be answering questions from Washington, D.C.

Please join me in taking a moment to remember those who were the victims of Nazism. #WeRemember https://t.co/Uugs4fgDWrMy Scaffold legislation is scheduled for a markup in @HouseJudiciary. This legislation ensures that every federal dollar invested in New York infrastructure projects goes further for construction and repairs, not insurance policies. https://t.co/4euFBJ6PypI spoke at the Ulster Co. Chamber of Commerce breakfast and urged a moderate, practical approach to many of the issues our country faces. These issues, such as immigration reform, health care, and infrastructure can be solved on a bipartisan basis. 
https://t.co/8BWCuk5SVUDACA can be addressed without shutting down the government. I am optimistic that Congress will come to a permanent solution that allows Dreamers to continue contributing to America, while also strengthening our border security. https://t.co/eBj2V983aII will be hosting a Veterans Resource Fair in Kingston on February 9th from 12 pm – 2pm.

Be sure to tune in! https://t.co/4xtMtdFu9GThank you @ShopRiteStores in Liberty for allowing me to tour your store to learn more about the grocery industry and meet your employees. Many of the issues discussed are part of the Farm Bill. https://t.co/5RaWWxkGdlOur infrastructure is in desperate need of repair. By creating a national infrastructure bank, we would have a self-sustaining funding mechanism to finance worthy projects across the nation.
https://t.co/7O9Zp2lluVA national infrastructure bank would be a privately funded and managed entity to finance worthy projects across the nation. Learn more about the idea and why it should be one tool to utilize in upcoming infrastructure discussions: https://t.co/7O9Zp2lluVAmerica’s infrastructure is falling apart. Along with my colleagues in the Problem Solvers Caucus, I helped develop a plan to rebuild our infrastructure in an effective and bipartisan manner.
https://t.co/qAl3UmoHhhI am pleased to see the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) re-authorized. This re-authorization will give families long-term peace of mind that their children can access quality medical care.I voted in support of ending this government shutdown. Now it is time for Congress to work together on important issues like finding a permanent legislative solution for DACA and investing in our crumbling infrastructure.My statement on the Senate cloture vote: https://t.co/IGBlFrWmIvDue to this completely avoidable and unnecessary shutdown, four national historical sites in the region are closed until the Senate comes to an agreement to reopen the government.

The next one is February 9th in Kingston. https://t.co/rGbsmwKFEiSenate Democrats continue to hold the government hostage over non-budgetary issues already being productively negotiated in good faith. As long as government funding continues to be held up, here is an article that answers some questions on a shutdown: https://t.co/jHX4Rurd4hMy full statement on the failure of the Senate to approve a responsible continuation of government funding passed by Republicans in the House: https://t.co/Pu28h808baIt is reckless by Senate Democrats to force a government shut down. No single issue is so important that we wouldn’t pay our troops, process veterans disability applications, or continue all the vital services millions of Americans are relying on.https://t.co/FcN1lNKNriI had the opportunity to visit with three young men who attend John Coleman High School. They traveled all morning to Washington for the March for Life and a cause they believe in.

I hope to participate again next year. https://t.co/Z2hyIKkfISI am disappointed that we once again have to revert to a short-term funding package. However, we must not shut down the government and deny critical national security funding. My statement: https://t.co/u47kVcvCx7I joined a bipartisan coalition of my colleagues in introducing legislation to allow individuals who paid any or all of their 2018 property taxes in 2017 to deduct them on their current 2017 tax bill, regardless of when the taxes were assessed.

I supported re-authorization of this program in November and am encouraged a final bill will be enacted into law soon. More: https://t.co/Mwu19RSMVUGov. Cuomo’s budget plan relies too heavily on tax increases and not enough on spending restraint and gov't reform. Taxing health insurers with a new surcharge and confiscating money from non-profit health insurers will inevitably cost consumers more. https://t.co/FI5YBkvOXNTremendous news on @Apple bringing home profits earned outside the USA. This was a great provision put in place with the new tax law. https://t.co/LSlVBnMRwuI joined over 40 of my colleagues in introducing the bipartisan USA Act. This proposal is a permanent legislative fix for Dreamers, while also strengthening our border security with 21st century technology. https://t.co/sKGGoYdwnW https://t.co/vV8PTeoXP1Protecting our nation requires that we provide necessary funding to our military forces.

New York residents continue to flee seeking lower taxes and more jobs. In his State of the State, I hope Gov. Cuomo recognizes the need to reverse this trend.New York is the only state in the U.S. to still have a law like the “Scaffold Law.” My bill allows projects using federal funding to utilize the same standard as every other state. Every federal dollar will go further for NY infrastructure projects. https://t.co/LuqQJUX8M6Thank you to the Otsego Co. Chamber of Commerce for hosting their ‘State of the State’ breakfast.

https://t.co/POHVWTTWBDIt is an option to pre-pay 2018 property taxes before the end of the year.
