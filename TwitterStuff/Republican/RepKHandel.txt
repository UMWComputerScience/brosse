I urge the Senate to swiftly take up that nomination and not let side issues or politics get in the way so that we can have a full bench as soon as possible.A little over a year after the confirmation of Justice Neal Gorsuch, we can see that @POTUS’ nomination was a resounding success. I am confident that the President will conduct a thorough search for a thoughtful and accomplished jurist and nominate a strong candidate.For thirty years, Justice Kennedy has dutifully served the Supreme Court and our great country. He was often at the center of many of the toughest and most pressing constitutional questions confronting the court, and we thank him for his service and jurisprudence.Congress needs to act on these issues, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting commonsense solutions in the future.Importantly, the bill also would have prohibited the separation of children from parents at the border. The status quo is unacceptable. Doing nothing perpetuates lawlessness at our border and results in de facto amnesty.Extremely disappointed that the House could not pass a sensible, long-term solution to our broken immigration system. Today’s bill included $25 billion in advanced funding for the border wall system &amp; other border security &amp; addressed @POTUS’ “Four Pillars” of immigration reform.Did you know about these resources available to you through the federal government?

I look forward to his testimony. @HouseJudiciary @GOPoversightIt is imperative that the Attorney General take immediate and substantive action to begin to repair the reputation of the FBI and regain the trust of Congress and, most importantly, the American people.Worse, according to the report, the IG was unable to definitively say that certain actions were free from bias. The report presents troubling facts that shake the confidence of the American people in the ability of the FBI and DOJ to conduct thorough, fair investigations.It is deeply disturbing that our country’s lead investigative arm was coopted by politics and bias.  It is abundantly clear from the IG report that the Obama Justice Department and FBI blatantly disregarded protocol during the Clinton investigation.Happy Birthday, @realDonaldTrump!

American families and manufacturers should not be collateral damage in a global trading war.Today’s actions — and the inevitable retaliatory moves by these countries — will hurt working Americans, negatively affect our economy, and do not further the goal of fostering more equitable trade.Existing jobs &amp; the creation of new jobs depend on the ability of U.S. companies to sell more American-made products and services. Mexico, Canada, and Europe are important allies and historical trading partners for #Georgia and the nation.I support President Trump’s goal to renegotiate agreements with our trading partners and champion the “America first” strategy, so that our farmers, businesses, and workers have a level playing field.With lower taxes and relief from onerous regulations, the U.S. economy has been reignited. The administration’s decision to levy tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico, Canada, and Europe threatens to dampen this recent progress.#NDAA, with largest pay raise in nine years, passes the House with overwhelming bipartisan support.

Bush, and to the entire Bush family, especially her 17 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.First Lady Barbara Bush was a leader in her own right whose strength, determination, and grace inspired a generation.Thank you to @RepOHalleran for joining me in introducing this bipartisan legislation.

Watch my remarks on H.R. 5440 from this afternoon here:
https://t.co/aNkDEeXtCwI was proud today that H.R. 5440 passed the House. It will hold the IRS accountable for putting its customers - U.S. taxpayers - first, ensuring help is available when one of the 300+ Taxpayer Assistance Centers across the country is closed.This time next year, in addition to most Americans paying less in taxes, taxpayers will find the process of filing their returns easier and less daunting. 

But Tax Day will still come in April 2019 &amp; people across the country will still turn to the IRS for help with their taxes.There's good news, though. This is the last time any of us will file using the outdated code.Tax Day could be a day of anxiety for families across America, particularly for those who owe money to the IRS. 

Either way, it's a day of frustration. Americans spent roughly $100 billion complying with IRS regulations over recent years.The last Tax Day using an outdated, inefficient code designed for the 20th Century.

In #GA6, the average family of four is making an extra $4,420 this year, using the standard deduction. https://t.co/BXy0yTT4wjToday is the last day Americans will file under a broken, 20th century tax code.

Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, nearly 9 of 10 Americans will be able to file in a simple and straightforward way-starting Tax Day, 2019.

Already, 90% of Americans are paying lower taxes in 2018. https://t.co/vF3P02bwV0Thank you Maj. Gen. Jarrard for the time spent discussing these and various other issues. And may God bless and protect these brave men and women - and all of our troops in harm's way.Our National Guard is always on call as a critical component of America's natural disaster response and recovery efforts.

Those bills range from increasing treatment access to developing improved methods for the disposal of excess pills.Opioids claimed the lives of roughly 60,000 Americans in 2016. That is completely unacceptable. 

The opioid epidemic is a national problem. Solving it requires bipartisan cooperation.I enjoyed visiting with and speaking to the Johns Creek Chamber of Commerce on Thursday morning.

These words, his words, are how I will remember Reverend Billy Graham.As Speakerl Ryan said this week, "Billy Graham woke up every day &amp; shared his love of God. That love had no end. That love had no barriers."

Graham worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. &amp; other Civil Rights activists fighting for racial equality in America in the 50s &amp; 60sIn his 99 years of life, Billy Graham preached the Gospel to an estimated 215 million people.  His sermons were translated into 48 languages and broadcast across more than 185 countries.Reverend Billy Graham is just the fourth private citizen to lie in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.

One of the best 3B and switch hitters ever- and a @Braves hat on his plaque!@finkedith Last night's vote reauthorized CHIP for 6 years - the longest reauthorization in CHIP's history.

On November 3, however, I also voted for, and the House passed, a 5-year CHIP reauthorization. It passed 242-174, with the support of 15 Democrats, and failed to move in the SenateBut that is not enough. Now, we need a long-term budget that funds our military and the rest of the government as we continue to work towards a responsible solution on the immigration issues we face in this country.This unnecessary shutdown put in jeopardy health insurance for nearly 9 million vulnerable American children, while delaying pay for more than 2 million U.S. troops as they fight to defend this country all over the world.

The shutdown did not need to happen. Tonight, it is over.Tonight, after Senate Democrats ended their filibuster, the Senate passed a CR to reopen the government. Just hours later, I voted in favor of the same Continuing Resolution.The Senate has taken a step closer to reopening the government by voting 81-18 to begin debate on its spending bill.

I urge them to act swiftly to pass the CR, reopen the federal government, and end the #SchumerShutdown as soon as possible.Shutting down the government, putting millions of our troops - and 230,000 Georgia children reliant on CHIP - in danger because of demands unrelated to the federal budget is reckless and irresponsible.In 2013, Senator Chuck Schumer said this regarding the shutdown of the federal government:
 
"The basic line is: No matter how strongly one feels about an issue, you shouldn’t hold millions of people hostage… That’s wrong and we can’t give in to that.”Tune in to @TimBryantRadio now to hear me discuss our work to end the shutdown, and some other things going on in Washington. Listen here:
https://t.co/qDKKvj2hAxFunding for our troops is literally being held hostage because Senate Democrats would rather protect 690,000 unlawful immigrants.That’s money that will come straight from their own pockets.When the shutdown began at midnight Saturday, these men &amp; women became responsible for costs they incurred traveling to cancelled trainings.Because of the #SchumerShutdown, 90,000 National Guardsmen and 20,000 Army Reservists have had their training cancelled this weekend.The #SchumerShutdown won't prevent our active duty military men and women from continuing their work across the world. 

It will just prevent them from being paid until Senate Democrats remember who they work for in Congress.The #SchumerShutdown is totally unnecessary, and Senate Democrats need to stop holding the govt hostage over issues unrelated to the budget2 million military members-particularly reservists-won’t be paid until the shutdown ends &amp; 50% of the civilian workforce will be furloughedI read the surveillance review memo from House Intel early this morning. The memo is disturbing, to say the least, and I believe it should be released to the public. #ReleaseTheMemoIf Senate Democrats succeed in shutting down the government, 9 million children will lose access to their health care and over 2 million military members will not be paid. All because of a made up DACA deadline.
 
DACA expires in March. Let's not ignore tonight's real deadline.Today, as thousands of Americans take part in the #MarchforLife in D.C., I was proud to help pass a bill that protects babies that survive an abortion. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act ensures that any baby born is protected by law &amp; is recognized as a human being https://t.co/cF5zSL93dNThe House voted tonight to keep the government &amp; military funded, and to extend the CHIP program. The #SchumerShutdown threatens all of that https://t.co/T3C6Y4MApkIf Senate Democrats fail to do their job and keep our government open, the American people will remember the  #SchumerShutdownSenate Democrats are threatening to shut down the government over unrelated issues and because of deadlines that don't exist.

We should not be playing these games. We should pass this continuing resolution and address real deadlines, like extending CHIP and funding our military. https://t.co/PN1lpV6UrRApple also reaffirmed its commitment to building a new U.S. campus and joined a long list of companies awarding bonuses in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

Tens of thousands of non-senior level Apple employees in America will receive a $2,500 bonus in the coming months.Yesterday Apple announced that it will pay the U.S. Treasury $38 billion in taxes on money it's bringing back into America.

Those are dollars that would have stayed overseas without the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Claim #1: "My Taxes are Going Up."
Reality: Here’s the truth: 8 in 10 Americans will pay lower taxes next year. 
The average family of 4in GA-6 makes $132,066. That family sees a tax cut of $4,658 in 2018 https://t.co/BKn4iUsban"The bill fixes our broken tax system by simplifying the tax code, lowering rates, and retaining deductions and tax provisions that encourage growth and investment in American business." https://t.co/vQ4lqqTXQXThese are the tax cuts American families &amp; businesses have needed since 1986

Republicans ran on a promise to bring tax cuts to the American people
 
Now, that kept promise will give the typical American family of 4 earning the median family income of $73,000 a tax cut of $2,059. https://t.co/O2buASrIDgThe #TaxCutsandJobsAct will save the typical American family of four making the average of $73,000 annually $2,039 per year.

And a special shout out to #72!Thank you to the conferees of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct.Excited to give tax cuts to all groups of Americans &amp; pass this bill into law next weekFinally, the #ProsperAct strengthens America's workforce development programs by prioritizing industry-led earn-and-learn programs that lead to high-wage, high-skill, and high-demand careers. 

Ultimately, a 21st century Economy demands a 21st century education system.Critically, the #ProsperAct also increases options to non-traditional career &amp; work study programs. It does this, among other things, by doubling current funding for Federal Work Study program and by lifting restrictions on students receiving training at private sector companies.As tuition rates continue to skyrocket across the U.S., outstanding student loan debt has exceeded $1 trillion. 

At the same time, we have 6 million unfilled skills-based jobs, a number expected to reach 11 million by 2022.

Above all, the #ProsperAct aims to fill those gaps.This week in the House @EdWorkforce Committee, I helped pass a bill designed to bring our higher education system into the 21st Century.
The #ProsperAct streamlines all federal student aid-simplifying FAFSA &amp; injecting transparency regarding tuition affordability into the processFrom the beginning, reducing the tax burden on hardworking Americans and middle class families has been our number one priority. And nothing has changed. https://t.co/dEALdJOQQxHappy Hanukkah to everyone beginning the celebration tonight! https://t.co/ApNW7vPuwBJerusalem has been - &amp; will always be - the undivided capital of Israel.

On a trip to Israel last year, Taylor was killed in a suicide attack by a Palestinian terrorist. Today, the Palestinian Authority pays a monthly pension to the family of Taylor's murderer through its "Martys Fund" ... (1/3)Tonight we voted to go to conference on #TaxReform. We're working towards a bill that will jumpstart the economy, simplify the tax code and, most importantly, cut taxes on working Americans and middle-income families.

https://t.co/olA1WStCh5We still have some steps to go. Ultimately, however, I am confident the final bill that passes the House and gets the President's signature will be a net positive for working families and business owners of #GA6, creating stronger growth, more jobs and higher wages.In the coming weeks, there will be conversations about changes to improve the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct as work to find compromise btwn the House &amp; Senate. One change was already made, restoring the adoption tax credit for families opening their homes to children from around the world.I was proud to support the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct, which passed the House by a 227-205 vote. With this bill, we're lowering income rates for all lower &amp; middle income Americans, doubling the standard deduction, increasing the child tax credit, and preserving the adoption tax credit.The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct is about more than tax cuts - it's about simplifying a tax code that is 75,00 pages long, that favors specific industries over another, and that has distorted economic decision making in America for decades. The status quo is simply not good enough.Additionally, 26,877 taxpayers in #GA6 are impacted by the AMT every year. That's nearly twice the national average. The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct eliminates the AMT.According the @USChamber, the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct will lead to the creation of an additional 975,000 jobs across the country, and will generate economic growth sufficient to increase federal tax revenue by 1 trillion dollars.The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct nearly doubles the standard deduction. That means the first $24,000 in annual income will be tax free for every married couple that files using the standard deduction.According to the @USChamber, the average family of 4 in #GA6 makes $132,066 per year. The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct will put $4,658 more annually in that family's bank account by using the standard deduction.In #Georgia, the @USChamber projects the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct will create an additional 29,521 jobs. WHAT'S MORE... in #GA6, the average family of 4 will take home an extra $4,658 per year by taking the standard deduction rather than itemizing when they file their taxes.Roughly 72,050 taxpayers in #GA6 have small business income. The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct lowers small business taxes to their lowest levels since WWII. With these tax cuts, we're working to spur growth of small businesses, which account for 64% of all new private-sector jobs in the USAnd the fact that the Child Tax Credit IS a credit – rather than a deduction – means this money goes in your pocket whether you itemize or not.The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct increases the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 per child - and it raises the credit’s income threshold from $110,000 to $230,000. Over 40,000 taxpayers in #GA6 already claim this credit, and even more would be able to use it if this bill becomes law.Such great, tireless work @RepKevinBrady and his entire team at @WaysandMeansGOP have done as they've sought to craft a bill that lowers the tax burden on the average American at every income level. And that's exactly what the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct does. Thank you all. https://t.co/fSuNFGYUTZGreat to be a part of this event on Tuesday!
