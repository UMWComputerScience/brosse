I am hopeful that this week the House will pass a bill that keeps families together, strengthens our borders, and reforms our broken immigration system.I have been working with House Republican leadership to resolve this in a way that protects our borders and our values. I, along with my colleagues, met with President Trump and he said he is 1000% with us and agrees these children must be protected.After my personal experience of traveling to the border and to the countries where most of the immigrants were originating, it was clear to me that we had a humanitarian crisis on our hands.  I will say again what I said then, this urgent crisis must be dealt with immediately.In 2014, I led a Border Crisis Working Group to understand the facts of the situation at the southern border.People in my District are very concerned about this issue and so am I. There needs to be a better way to secure our borders that doesn‚Äôt tear apart families. These children did not make the choice to cross the border and shouldn‚Äôt be punished for it.My statement regarding family separations at the United States/Mexico border -&gt;

Importantly, the rescissions package on the floor today no longer rescinds Ebola funding. Sadly, that horrible virus has recently returned to the Democratic Republic of Congo.As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I understand more than most that President Trump‚Äôs proposal rescinding nearly $15 billion is necessary.
It‚Äôs common sense that money sitting in federal coffers and not being spent should be returned to the treasury.We must always be careful stewards of the taxpayer‚Äôs hard-earned money. That‚Äôs why I was proud to sign on as an original co-sponsor of President Trump‚Äôs rescissions package.This afternoon, I spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in support of H.R. 3, President Trump‚Äôs $15 billion rescissions package. https://t.co/2of5eh2tvt"This bill continues the progress we were able to make in FY18.

I urge other countries to follow the Unites States‚Äô lead and locate their embassies in Israel‚Äôs eternal capital.I would like to commend President Trump for moving our embassy to Jerusalem.

Even though it did not pass, that doesn‚Äôt mean I will give up on the fight to control wasteful spending.We have to get serious about changing the way money is spent in Washington. I have voted for a Balanced Budget Amendment in the past and was proud to support it again yesterday.My statement on the on the failed passage of Balanced Budget Amendment Resolution-&gt; https://t.co/cA045NDmgbMy Statement on the Historic FY18 Omnibus Funding Bll https://t.co/tL1WlufhU0Thank you all for your support of this vital legislationAfter talking with Secretary Mattis, we included new flexibility for @DeptofDefense to ensure that these funds were able to be spent in the smartest way possible while still maintaining stringent oversight.By the time this agreement is enacted, @DeptofDefense will have around 5 months to spend the money. I was very concerned that this short time frame could lead to poor spending decisions.We also funded programs to protect and defend Israel including: 
‚úîÔ∏èAnti-tunneling initiatives; and 
‚úîÔ∏èThe Israeli cooperative missile defense programs.Our military must be ready for future threats.  The @DeptofDefense must look five, ten and twenty years ahead to make sure we have the weapons systems we need.This agreement funds 14 Navy ships, including:
‚úîÔ∏èOne carrier replacement,
‚úîÔ∏è3 littoral combat ships, 
‚úîÔ∏è2 guided missile destroyers, 
‚úîÔ∏èTwo attack submarines, and 
‚úîÔ∏èFull funding to continue the Ohio replacement submarine program.This agreement makes investments into vital aircraft including:
‚úîÔ∏èJoint strike fighters
‚úîÔ∏èSuper hornets
‚úîÔ∏èApaches
‚úîÔ∏èChinooks
‚úîÔ∏èLakotas
‚úîÔ∏èV-22 ospreys
‚úîÔ∏èBlack hawks, and 
‚úîÔ∏èC-130sThe omnibus provides a total of $654 billion for fiscal year 2018. This is $23 billion above the president‚Äôs request, and $61 billion over last year.I worked closely with Secretary Mattis to ensure this bill provides him with the resources he needs to implement the new national defense strategy and restore our military.Since becoming chair, it has been my goal to ensure that this bill reflects the needs of our defense and intelligence experts so that they have the resources needed to combat the threats of today and in the future.As chair of the Defense @HouseAppropsGOP Subcommittee, I want to start by thanking all of you who voted for the budget agreement that enabled us to make the largest investment in our military in 15 yearsCongress‚Äôs number one responsibility is to provide for the defense of this nation and this agreement enables us to fulfill that most fundamental constitutional duty.The STOP School Violence Act incorporates key elements from legislation I introduced earlier this month, the Securing Children in Schools Act of 2018 (H.R.5135).

This is also a common-sense solution that goes beyond the debates over mental health and guns.  Let‚Äôs focus on stopping criminals with guns from entering our schools.  This plan will do just that.My plan will: 
*Provide federal grant $ to school districts seeking to install metal detectors;
*Require any school receiving $ to limit entrances so that metal detectors provide protection;
*Require any school applying to work w/ local law enforcement 2 qualify for the grant.When we decided to make airports safe from armed terrorists, we installed metal detectors and dramatically increased safety. It‚Äôs time we did the same thing for our schools. By helping local schools purchase metal detectors we can stop the scourge of violence in our schools.Yesterday, I announced plans to introduce legislation that will encourage local school districts to buy and install metal detectors at all local schools -&gt; https://t.co/NjSzyq6UqsOver his lifetime, Rev.

Read my full statement -&gt; https://t.co/F9G9kg2yl2It also provides for our veterans by helping to reduce the maintenance backlog at the @DeptVetAffairs, repeals parts of ObamaCare, includes money for opioid addiction programs, invests in infrastructure, provides extra funds for @NIH, &amp; authorizes CHIP for 10 years.This agreement also includes additional disaster relief for Hurricane Harvey recovery.The budget deal reached yesterday is a win for our military. I‚Äôm thrilled the Pentagon will finally receive the money that it needs. https://t.co/F9G9kg2yl2Thank you to all who have expressed concern about my safety. I had a breakfast appointment in Washington, D.C. this morning and drove to the GOP retreat. Please pray for the family of the deceased and for the safety of those injured in this tragic incident.As you may have heard, this morning a train carrying Republican lawmakers to a conference in West Virginia collided with a truck. Sadly, it appears that at least one person has died.I share the president‚Äôs determination to rebuild our military forces. All federal dollars are not the same. We need to prioritize our national security in an increasingly dangerous world. #SOTUAs Chairwoman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I Iook forward to working with the president to give our military leaders the sufficient, sustainable, and stable funding they have told us ‚Äì over and over again ‚Äì that they need. #SOTUMy bill provides more than $60B more for our nation‚Äôs defense than we spent last year. It also takes care of our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen by fully funding a 2.4 percent pay increase. In an increasingly dangerous world, we need to prioritize our national security.This afternoon, the House passed my bill to fully fund our nation‚Äôs armed forces at levels recommended by our military leaders. This is the third time we have passed this legislation. It's past time that this essential, must-pass funding bill for our military be enacted into law.House Again Passes Bill to Fund the Department of Defense https://t.co/bHJ6Ot6nXMThis is a very challenging time for our country, and Chairman Frelinghuysen will leave tough shoes to fill. I will work hard to earn the support of my colleagues, and I look forward to a spirited race.Since Chairman Frelinghuysen announced his retirement, people have been encouraging me to seek the Appropriations Committee gavel.Today, I am announcing that I‚Äôm running to be chairwoman of the @HouseAppropsGOPI wish @USRepRodney and his family all the best in his retirement. He is leaving a legacy of honesty and commitment to the nation.I‚Äôve worked with Chairman @USRepRodney for many years. He is a dear friend and colleague, and a tireless advocate for rebuilding our nation‚Äôs military. I have valued working alongside him on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, where he preceded me as chairman."Congress‚Äôs number one responsibility is to provide for the defense of this nation. It is this bill that fulfills that most fundamental constitutional duty." https://t.co/mKD4k6uUhtSince 1993, the United States has celebrated Religious Freedom Day on January 16th. This commemoration marks the passage on January 16, 1786, of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, authored by Thomas Jefferson. https://t.co/qnLVRJ1iPUThis statute served as the inspiration for the Constitution‚Äôs first amendment, guaranteeing the freedom of religion. As Americans, our commitment to religious liberty should serve as a beacon to those around the world who are persecuted for their faith.This Martin Luther King, Jr. Day we honor a great American who dedicated his life to freedom, opportunity, and equal justice for all. https://t.co/GgNyIUj38XMerry Christmas to you and yours https://t.co/BU7d51dVEdCongress has finally delivered on the promise of tax reform, and I am proud to have supported this historic tax bill.There has been a lot of mischaracterization of what this bill does, but the American people will know the truth when they start to see more money in their paychecks as early as February of next year.Businesses will be able to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment to improve operations and enhance the skills of their workers.This legislation delivers real relief to businesses by lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, down from 35 percent. In fact, it reduces taxes on small businesses to the lowest they‚Äôve been in 40 years.It also allows Texans to write off up to $10,000 of their property taxes.With this bill, the typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of $2,059. The bill also expands the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children.The bill nearly doubles the standard tax deduction and reduces loopholes, while preserving important tax breaks such as the teacher tax deduction for classroom expenses.In addition, this legislation not only protects current American jobs but also encourages companies who have moved overseas to come home and bring jobs back to Texas.Today, the House passed the most sweeping, pro-growth tax reform since President Reagan. These tax cuts will ensure Texans keep more of their hard earned money.The Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act is a game-changer for every day American families. That is why we are determined to send to @POTUS‚Äôs desk by Christmas ‚Üí https://t.co/xUKkMLewCY #2059moreA hard working family of 4 earning a median income of $73,000 a year gets #2059more back in their pocket each year. https://t.co/xUKkMLewCYSee what‚Äôs new in the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act:
‚úî Significantly increases the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year
‚úî Expands the child tax credit to $2,000
‚úî Lowers the corporate tax rate to 21%
