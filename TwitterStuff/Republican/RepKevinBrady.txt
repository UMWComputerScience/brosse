Great philanthropist - sheltered Harvey victims in his stores! #MadeInAmerica https://t.co/BYFw49cGWgWhy are Democrats in Congress ignoring Harvey and Maria victims in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida? Stop blocking $81 billion disaster aid in Senate. DACA important, sure, but more important than hurricane victims? #WrongPriorities #StopDelayingHarveyHelp https://t.co/UwF80uLrj4Enjoyed talking #taxreform benefits for our small businesses with folks from the @tomballchamber. Great people doing great work. https://t.co/hU85LkzRCLGreat visit to @FreseniusKC.

We hit the ground running this morning. Thanks for having me @TrinityJobs and @ConroeChamber. https://t.co/ElznIdtqcBRelieved Senate DEMS reversed course. Joining GOP to end #SchumerShutdown. Our troops, Harvey victims &amp; kids no longer held hostage. Shutdowns never good for the American people. Lets work together.  #ReasonPrevails https://t.co/PRv3FNv2K221,950 children in our congressional district harmed by #SchumerShutdown. Funding running out for TX kids. Democrats blocking CHIP renewal in shutdown. Regardless of UR view of DACA,  is that more important than health care for 21,000 local children and pregnant women? https://t.co/WWY8Bk2bAr#SchumerShutdown hurting Hurricane Harvey victims in our community. Delaying critical help. Regardless of your view, is unrelated DACA more important than thousands of Harvey families and victims? Open the government, Sen. Schumer.  #WrongPriorities  #StopHurtingHarveyVictims https://t.co/0vdH2CAtbBOur children, our veterans, and those serving our country in uniform - many in harm's way - deserve better. @SenSchumer and @SenateDems... open the government. https://t.co/kmZ2O8E4ESSen Schumer, aren‚Äôt their lives more important than partisan politics? Be reasonable Sen Schumer - open the Government. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/jusgDqMBKoWhat we know this moment: around globe American troops and border guards defending us without pay.  Be reasonable Sen Schumer - open the Government. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/DmScJrOtPqSenate Dems vote to ‚Äòshut ‚Äòer down‚Äô as promised. Cheer turning backs on military, children‚Äôs health care and U.S. jobs. Expect more political stunts. #Shameful #ShumerShutdown #HurtAmericaSenate Dems preparing to shut down govt. Our soldiers must defend us with no pay?!! Just wrong. #ShumerShutdownIt's incredibly powerful to see all the people standing up for life and the preservation of family at @March_for_Life. #LoveSavesLives https://t.co/ZSby7zmIbTWhether you‚Äôre pro-choice or strongly #ProLife as I am, we can all agree that children who are born alive deserve the same protections of law the rest of us are entitled to. I am proud to have voted for such meaningful legislation that advances pro-family protections. https://t.co/ZaJiTrv3DzTexas Democrats vote to shut down government, delay important Harvey relief aid that Texans need now, and stop healthcare for children. But find time for impeaching @POTUS? #PrioritiesWrong https://t.co/S7kx5EX97ZI‚Äôm hopeful and expect to see more announcements of this type in the future.  https://t.co/EnQQLR6diSOur troops and the millions of children who rely on CHIP don't deserve to suffer because of partisan politics. 

I hope Senate Democrats think long and hard about the damage they will do to our country by shutting the government down.I urge my Democrat colleagues to stand with Republicans on behalf of children and families and workers ‚Äì keep this government open. https://t.co/St7VhK8B7Q
