Praying for the victims of the shooting yesterday in Annapolis and proud the Capital Gazette was able to publish today.Today would be my Grandma Edna’s 107th birthday. She passed last year at the age of 105 - and I miss her everyday. Below is a picture of my grandma along with my Grandpa Orie and me circa late 1970s. https://t.co/an6pqXduZtEnjoyed showing Allison Park, this year’s Congressional Art Competition winner from our District, and her family around the Capitol. Her artwork is now on display in the halls of Congress for all to see, including me each time I walk to the House floor. Congrats again Allison. https://t.co/tkpVnf955IThank you to Justice Kennedy for your decades of service to our nation and the immense impact you have left on our history. I look forward to the President selecting a replacement who will uphold the rule of law and follow the constitution.H.R. 6 will help in our overall efforts to advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and bolster our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl.Front page reminder that we must do more to save people like Stephanie and opioid addiction. The House recently passed H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, with my support. https://t.co/joJPRUDovqCongratulations @BVSWDebate! As a former high school debater, I know the amazing competition you faced. You all should be proud. https://t.co/QKJMwOBLjbCheck out my weekly newsletter below to learn more about what I’m doing to reunite families at the border, how the Quindaro Landmark legislation in advancing, and more. https://t.co/auSVH7P2RuThese vets have been denied the benefits they deserve for too long, and today’s bill was a bipartisan solution to help them get the VA care they need. I’ve cosponsored this bill for several years, and I will continue pushing to get H.R. 299 through the Senate and signed into law.Tonight I was proud to vote in favor of H.R. 299 the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act to bring long-overdue fairness for Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange while serving at sea.Thanks for showing me around today @TSA_Pekoske - very impressive! https://t.co/3ISbjpdepzAs Chairman of @DHSgov @HouseAppropsGOP, I took a tour of the TSA Systems Integration Facility where TSA conducts testing of screening equipment for the checkpoint and checked baggage to keep Americans safe. https://t.co/V8qNt80AgGToday, I asked for moment of silence on the House Floor for Wyandotte County deputies, Theresa Sue King and Patrick Thomas Rohrer, who lost their lives last Friday. God bless Deputy King and Deputy Rohrer, and may they rest in peace. https://t.co/kepHN3que0Congress should take up the Family Reunification Act immediately, and if not I will work to see the language is included in my must-pass DHS funding bill.

https://t.co/bpdgkwWiiKI’m glad the Administration has heeded my calls to stop separating families and has already worked to get about 500 families back together. We must still finalize long-term solutions to fix this problem permanently and reunite the remaining families.RIP Charles Krauthammer. He was an intellectual heavyweight who was admired by conservatives and progressives alike. His voice will be greatly missed.Let’s pass the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act, which includes my HR 392 language in addition to fixing DACA and making much-needed investments to secure our borders. The American people want action, it’s time for Congress to step up to the plate and deliver.Tomorrow is the day we find out if Sunayana Dumala and hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came here legally will get out of their 70-year green card backlog. Immigrants enrich the diversity and culture of America.Marvin and I also met with other lawmakers, including Missouri Representatives Lacy Clay and @repcleaver, to discuss my bill. They are both cosponsors of the bill, and I appreciate their support! https://t.co/IhU2JVOeuKTogether, we presented the case for why Quindaro deserves to become a National Historic Landmark. With its unique combination of Bleeding Kansas, Underground Railroad, and African American history, the site is worthy of one of our country’s most prestigious designations.Excited that my Quindaro National Historic Landmark legislation received a hearing in the House today. It was an honor to have Quindaro native Marvin Robinson on hand to provide testimony to the subcommittee. https://t.co/8yOX7lFJHXThey're facing the same problem as dreamers, but aren't getting nearly the attention. Sri's plight is one of the reasons I'm fighting to pass my bill, HR 392, that puts an end to this injustice.

Sri is the face of the green card backlog.Because of an injustice in our immigration laws, she might have to leave the U.S. – the country where she has grown up - in 6 months. She's 1 of about 600,000 young people who grew up here as children of legal immigrants who are going to age out of our system in the next 10yrsI had the pleasure of meeting w/ Sri, a software engineer working at Microsoft. She grew up here in America, graduated from the University of Iowa, and is a remarkable young woman. She was brought here by her parents, who immigrated to America legally on a high-skilled work visa https://t.co/DAcvtSEGCMAbout to join @ej_becker and Ellen on @KMBZradio to talk about pushing the Administration to suspend family separations and the road forward legislatively in Congress on immigration. Tune in to 98.1 FM to listen live.The trauma inflicted on these kids is too big a price to pay. I left feeling positive and am pleased to see executive action is imminent. I want to thank Secretary Nielsen for listening on this.I made the case to Secretary Nielsen yesterday that Congress is working on a long-term solution to give her the tools to secure our border while keeping families together at the same time, but that the Administration should suspend the practice while we completed our work. https://t.co/LFh735RsmpThank you for the support @Mark_Shriver. Congress is working to fix this. https://t.co/X1otbDazse.@SenatorDole is an American hero and even in his 90's, continues to make a powerful impact. A wonderful read from @washingtonpost. https://t.co/3dBJmhEZjzAppreciate the kind words from my former #LegBranch Ranking Member @RepTimRyan - a true class act. https://t.co/8ItTeTxgZlThat’s why I’m demanding that Attorney General Sessions halt the practice of family separation at the border immediately as Congress works toward legislative solutions. https://t.co/4Ep86WJfRUAs the son of a social worker, I know the human trauma that comes with children being separated from their parents. It takes a lasting, and sometimes even irreversible toll on the child’s well being.Tonight we honor @WycoSheriff Deputies Theresa King and Patrick Rohrer, and all law enforcement. Our strong community has gathered to show our support for good over evil. https://t.co/KtyPDtcsCLHappy daddy hair salon day! https://t.co/S82uG3iWRgHappy Fathers Day to my dad Wayne who taught me many lessons - hard work, dedication, and most importantly to love the Kansas Jayhawks. https://t.co/EJd2Kt8l1OI have personally shared my sympathies with @WycoSheriff Don Ash and his team. Please keep our law enforcement and their families in your prayers.A terrible tragedy. Praying for their families. https://t.co/T8ZGyXp8rrThis is tragically not the first time our community has been reminded of the ultimate sacrifice our men and women of law enforcement stand ready to make every day. We owe our police force, their families, and their loved ones a debt of gratitude we will never be able to repay.We are all shocked and saddened by the death of one of the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Deputies today and are praying for the safe recovery of the other.Praying for our first responders and their families. https://t.co/RF2e2IW41AHonoring #FlagDay at my District Office in ⁦⁦@DowntownOP⁩ .

I'm working with @repcleaver on the Jason Flatt Teen Suicide Prevention Act, to require teachers, principals, counselors and other school officials to receive youth suicide awareness and prevention training in schools. https://t.co/cStws4PrssThat funding should be rolled over in the appropriations process to ensure CHIP can help low income children who need care and can’t afford it. Our government spends far too much, but CHIP isn’t the place to cut.I voted no on the rescissions package last night. Clawing back funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program just a few months after providing it with the longest reauthorization in history sends the wrong signal about our priorities.WATCH: My interview today with @HARRISFAULKNER on @OutnumberedOT about securing our border and coming up with a bipartisan compromise on immigration: https://t.co/NSghTU4ToDTune in to @OutnumberedOT on @FoxNews - about to join @HARRISFAULKNER to recap my fact finding mission to the US-Mexico border and what we need to do to secure the border and keep America safe.Remembering #DDay and the words from Gen.

As Chairman of @DHSgov @HouseAppropsGOP I support these education efforts and voted for STOP School Violence Act providing grants for school security.Addressing @DHSgov and @SecretService National Threat Assessment Center training for school resource officers &amp; counselors and local law enforcement today in OP. https://t.co/E4xxd3Q4btKansas Ag producers who have quietly lost half of their income in the last 5 years are they exact forgotten men and women the President is trying to help.

House passage of NDAA will rebuild our military and fulfill our Constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense. https://t.co/E62acboW7ZNo parent should ever have to endure the pain and sorrow of Greg and Missey Smith. Law enforcement needs the tools to prevent these tragedies and make sure what happened to Kelsey never happens again. @SenPatRoberts and I are ready to deliver those tools. https://t.co/iOSeY30BJoAs for the reports that foreign journalists remain in North Korea, I’m confident @SecPompeo and others in the Administration have contingencies in place to ensure they will not be detained or harmed. If not, I would urge them to do so.The United States will continue to apply maximum pressure on North Korea and Kim Jong Un until he ultimately realizes he must give up his nuclear ambitions.The President is right to walk away from the table if the North Korean regime is balking at basic demands and continuing with provocative and dangerous rhetoric. The surest way to achieve peace is through strength.Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was never going to come easy, so today’s development shouldn’t come as a surprise. Making a deal for the sake of making one doesn’t achieve real peace, as we saw with the failed JCPOA with Iran.The Fourth Amendment is clear, if the federal gov wants to access Americans’ digital content, it must get a warrant. Yesterday, I urged my colleagues to support the inclusion of the #EmailPrivacyAct in the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act. https://t.co/xlGc2dO1E6This is an approach that is based on evidence, rooted in compassion, and represents another plank in our economic agenda to help move our country forward and improve life for all Americans.That’s why I was proud to vote in favor of the FIRST STEP Act today. This legislation will reform and modernize the federal prison system and help prisoners return as productive members of society through new job training, mental health, and educational programs.Unfortunately, former prisoners are to too often left without the tools or resources they need to be successful, and two-thirds of released prisoners will be rearrested within three years.Each year, around 650,000 people are released from federal or state prison, beginning a difficult transition back into society.Proud of this effort and there’s no better partner than @SenPatRoberts to have leading the charge in the Senate https://t.co/1VhuyEXTx2My bill to solve it has 324 cosponsors. 

“Will Congress Ever Solve The Long Wait For Green Cards?” via @forbes https://t.co/G3MmijwGdxHonoring our military &amp; veterans yesterday on #ArmedForcesDay in Overland Park. Thank you to Paul Chapa from FISH - Friends in Service of Heroes - for putting on today’s event. #ArmedForcesDay2018 https://t.co/DKm1xjw4htI will continue to work with Americans on both sides of the gun safety debate as we work to come up additional common sense reforms that help get at the root of the problems we face.Those who choose to politicize these tragedies only sow further division and discord, setting back our efforts to come up with lasting, bipartisan solutions to these problems.We should build upon the bipartisan bills this Congress &amp; Administration have already passed into law,  including fixing the background check system, lifting restrictions on gun violence research at CDC, increasing funding to improve local school security, &amp; banning bump stocks.As we learn more details about what happened we will continue our work to make our schools and communities as safe and secure as possible.What happened earlier today in Santa Fe, TX was a horrific tragedy. Brooke and I are praying for the victims and hurting for the parents who have lost their children.Looking forward to seeing this work of art in the Statehouse by KCK artist Michael Young, recognizing this historical decision. https://t.co/VWTbStXCD5This is great news.

I am excited to be joining these dedicated preservationists in the fight to protect Quindaro and increase investment in the site. https://t.co/R9J0aFP9qoI will continue to work with the @USArmy to expedite the process. Johnson Countians deserve this land back for productive use. https://t.co/dLAtKvJx9hThis has been a guiding principle for President Trump on foreign policy and it holds true today as his Administration has followed through on this promise where his Republican and Democrat predecessors had failed.And we must be strong in our actions and our words in fulfilling the commitments we make as a nation to ensure our allies trust us and our enemies fear us - particularly as we seek diplomatic solutions with North Korea and Iran.Radical groups like Hamas won’t take this move lightly, as we’ve seen with the violence on display today. But in the face of terror and violence, we must be even more resolute in our support for freedom and liberty in Israel as the only democracy in the region.Today’s opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem finally fulfills a commitment that has been made for decades by American presidents from both parties. As @netanyahu said at the opening ceremony, the relationship between the US and Israel is stronger than ever.Nice to see front page update today on @VCP_HQ Veterans Village.

Every person who hears her amazing story knows they must do their part to make the world a better place. https://t.co/xM2wSUbMciSonia’s message of love was heard by a bipartisan group of Members of Congress, including @RepLeeZeldin and @RepEliotEngel, @SenSasse, staff, family, and many others including Dr. Carla Hayden, @LibnOfCongress https://t.co/gsrWanik2wLast night, I was proud to host Holocaust survivor and now movie star Sonia Warshawski of Prairie Village at the US Capitol for a panel discussion and special screening of @bigsoniamovie https://t.co/PTaegF3cshWe must never forget the horrors, the suffering, and the loss endured in the Holocaust so many years ago. Each year, we pause in remembrance on Yom HaShoah to think of the six million innocent lives lost and to celebrate the survivors and tell their stories.Today on Holocaust Remembrance Day, I’m honored to have Holocaust Survivor, Sonia Warshawski, at the U.S. Capitol to share her moving story and message of love with Congress. https://t.co/gpF6IRlQStLet’s all follow @MindyCorporon example and create a wave of positive change for the future. Let's make a ripple and change the world. @GiveSevenDays https://t.co/XfZHBWnKWLProud of these great Kansans &amp; looking forward to Mike Pompeo receiving the same bipartisan confirmation vote for Secretary of State he received as Director of CIA. He will serve our nation with honor &amp; distinction in his new role &amp; provide a strong voice on Iran, NK, &amp; Russia. https://t.co/fB2rqyT9u1I’m confident our majority will be in good hands moving forward as we continue to fight for the American people and their priorities.I want to thank Speaker Ryan for his service to the people of Wisconsin and to our nation. His strong legacy of leadership on tax cuts for middle class families, record job growth, and rebuilding our military will not be forgotten.Recognizing @GiveSevenDays this week in my office and thinking of my friend @MindyCorporon, an amazing example of kindness, as we all work to "Make a Ripple, Change the World." #GiveSevenDays https://t.co/VRiZQvGULECheck out my latest weekly email newsletter below, where I discuss the harmful trade war, commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s legacy, announce that the film Big Sonia is coming to the Capitol for a special screening this week, and more.

It’s a story about survival, a true example of the American Dream, and a wonderful tribute to Sonia and her message of love.I've known Sonia for years as a friend and customer. Now she is a local celebrity. I’m proud to bring @bigsoniamovie to the US Capitol to share it with my colleagues in Congress. https://t.co/qoYIJTdl4MAs I've said before, the Administration should not go down this course.These latest round of retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese government on each of these sectors will only do harm to our economy and jeopardize the enormous gains we've made on jobs, wages, and stock market growth over the last year.Soybeans, beef, and aircraft are three of the top five commodities and products Kansas farmers, ranchers, and businesses export for sale abroad. Combined, they made up nearly $4 billion of our $11.25 billion in exports last year and supported tens of thousands of Kansas jobs.Great to meet w/ my Veterans’ Advisory Committee to discuss issues that affect our active military and veterans w/ special guest @RepDougCollins. To conclude the meeting, I had the honor to present Gerald Tremmel, Jr. w/ medals his father earned during WWII that he never received https://t.co/AMgNdrtwxb@repjohnlewis It was a rare moment of unity in our divided political times, but remembering that day gives me hope that we will continue to work together as Americans to make our country a better place for our children and generations to come.Today’s tragic anniversary of Dr. King's assassination reminds me of one of the most humbling and fulfilling experiences of my life, spending time with @repjohnlewis at the 50th anniversary of the march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama:

1) No pay increase for Members of Congress

2) 12% less spending on Congress than when Democrats ran the House in 2010 https://t.co/rX4aTjITr4Proud to have authored provisions in today's spending bill to reject pay increases for Members of Congress and to provide Congress with 12% lower spending levels than when Nancy Pelosi ran the House in 2010. https://t.co/jVDakYoPuNOnly in Kansas https://t.co/PgPXUffPKzOverall @NIH funding for medical research is increased by $3 billion to $37 billion total for FY18.

For more information on the competition, please visit: https://t.co/uCQSkrINU5 https://t.co/GONOBzkHuGGreat meeting with PTA constituents and talking about federal edu policies and school safety measures. On the same day I met w/ PTA, I voted in favor of the STOP School Violence Act, which will provide increased federal resources to schools and localities to make schools safer https://t.co/bTiLdUESdQPiper HS senior Alexander Falk shadowed my office as part of a project on how Congress passes legislation. I was impressed w/ his draft House Resolution on the importance of teaching civics to K-12 students &amp;his desire for young people to be excited about the legislative process https://t.co/QabvLngUCTCongrats to Bruce Weber and the @KStateMBB team on making it to the Sweet 16 for the 17th time in school history with their win over @UMBC_MBB last night. #EMAW #MarchMadness https://t.co/Uli9HLzzATRock Chalk Jayhawk - congrats to Bill Self and the @KUHoops team on making it to the Sweet 16 for the 31st time in school history and 10th time under Coach Self #MarchMadness https://t.co/lS1QDSuCXWFor those planning a trip to Washington, my DC staff is happy to provide @uscapitol tours free of charge, help you organize @WhiteHouse tours &amp; give helpful hints for best places to visit in DC. If you'd like more information, click here: https://t.co/Z01WP9sCVK.On Wednesday, I met with both the Williams family from Fairway and the Stoltz family from Leawood before their tour began. It was a pleasure meeting with you all – and I hope everyone who came to my office this week had a great trip! https://t.co/nqDx7QfL8fI always enjoy running into Kansans from my district while in DC visiting the nation’s capital. This week alone, we had 37 different groups from all over the district, including Overland Park, Kansas City, Fairway, Olathe, Lenexa, and Shawnee in my office for U.S. Capitol tours.We talked about the importance of increased funding for the @NIH which I am fighting hard for in the House. I was inspired by these two Kansans who are fighting to improve the lives of those living with type 1 diabetes, and I am proud to join them in this effort.It was a pleasure seeing constituents from @JDRF, a global organization that advocates for funding type 1 diabetes research. Marlo Martin and Kerri Lindsay are two moms from the 3rd District who have kids with diabetes. https://t.co/HVFnePtmyfWhat happened in Parkland was a massive breakdown in the system where we missed so many clear warning signs. This bill takes important steps to prevent that from happening again.We passed the STOP School Violence Act, which provides federal grant funding for evidence-based training to prevent school violence. It gives needed resources to local law enforcement, school staff, and students to help identify and prevent violence against themselves or others.I’ve said since the horrific shooting in Parkland that doing nothing is not an option, that we must act to secure our schools and provide a safe learning environment for our children. Today, the House of Representatives did something.Congratulations to my friend and former House colleague Mike Pompeo on being nominated as the nation’s 70th Secretary of State - and first Kansan to ever serve in the role. We are grateful for his continued service to our country.To learn more information on the internship program, please click here: https://t.co/7tZiW78bKY.Attention all college students - applications are due TOMORROW for my summer internship program in DC. It's a great opportunity to learn about the legislative process, the various functions of a Congressional office, and the way things work on Capitol Hill. https://t.co/Nu6d6gqbaFWhile I’m encouraged tonight, we should keep up that pressure while pursuing a diplomatic solution that will leave the United States, its allies, and the world safer and more secure.It’s a direct result of the pressure the President, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Congress have been putting on the North Koreans over the last year.Tonight’s announcement of Kim Jong Un’s desire to meet with President Trump with a commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is nothing short of historic.Go Jaguars! https://t.co/dbHKnUHHeRThat’s why I’ve returned money to the treasury every single year I’ve been in office, and why I’ll keep fighting to save the taxpayer money in my own budgets and in my role on the Appropriations Committee.When it comes to being a good steward of taxpayer dollars, I’ve always believed it’s important that my office set an example. Kansans have to make tough decisions on how to spend their paychecks every month, and Congress needs to be doing the same.
https://t.co/roWcdMh6cTThis morning I stopped by the RareKC Townhall Event to talk to constituents about rare diseases. KC is a leader in this fight to find a cure &amp; organizations like @RareKC. research institutions like KU Med and Children's Mercy, &amp;others are working to make headway in those efforts https://t.co/WwoxkofYRzTariffs and trade wars are a loser for the American people, driving up costs on working families. Kansans and our agriculture sector that’s already seen its income cut in half over the last half decade will be hit especially hard. @POTUS should reconsider this course of action..@KCPLConnect &amp; @WestarEnergy  are passing on 100% of their savings to Kansas ratepayers https://t.co/HAOx0rdwF7Don’t forget to #CheckYourCheck https://t.co/lzF8RKaGDK@POTUS @VP If you happen to be visiting Washington, DC today, the Rotunda will be opened to the public for a viewing line starting at 1 PM ET.

Rev Graham's family, members of Congress, and @POTUS and @VP will all gather for a service to pay their respects. Watch live here: 
https://t.co/I8oCNeERwtThree takeaways from my meetings last week with workers across #KS03 about the benefits they're seeing from tax reform. https://t.co/tOGq6jn4KTIn Washington this tends to be a philosophical debate sometimes about what good tax policy is. But back home in places like Kansas, this means bigger paychecks and greater opportunity for our constituents. https://t.co/BPYn9zat0UI'm joining @SpeakerRyan, @GOPLeader, @SteveScalise, and @cathymcmorris for the @HouseGOP weekly leadership press conference this morning in about 5 min.

I stopped by today for a visit and to see how they have expanded over the last year plus. https://t.co/3xZSPLb2bxMeeting with @Walmart employees today. #TaxCutsandJobsAct means:

✅ up to $1,000 bonuses
✅ $11 minimum wage
✅ $5,000 for adoption costs
✅ 10 weeks paid maternity leave
✅ 6 weeks paid paternity leave https://t.co/2CYPGCwG6wToday I visited a local @Walmart in Shawnee and met with employees to talk about the benefits they’re receiving because of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct - some of the more than 1,000,000 hourly workers around the US who are seeing these benefits ⬇️⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/wCh1AH1lQpFellow Haven Grade School grad (only a few years behind me) @HomeDepot manager “Coop” https://t.co/3re2Q4oZ5PReally enjoyed touring and learning all about the products @HomeDepot has to offer, especially how they prioritize products made here in the US and even nearby in Kansas. https://t.co/8fGXwbX0dpLearning how to mix paint at @HomeDepot in Olathe. I went with “Johnson County beige” https://t.co/ps3jnt4X9HTouring @HomeDepot today meeting employees, district manager, and store managers from the six stores in #KS03. All Home Depot hourly employees are receiving bonuses up to $1,000 because of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct https://t.co/tU5hp7LljjThe most important piece of legislation passed in 2017 was the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. The average #KS03 family will see a $2,728 tax cut - putting economic opportunity back in the hands of Kansans. https://t.co/AAL8NztMxeQuestion about H1B visas - another issue I’ve worked on in Congress. One of the best ways to combat illegal immigration is to ensure folks can legally come here and contribute to America. Right now our system incentivizes illegal immigration - that’s wrong. https://t.co/TPD858jGq1Discussing foreign policy and our approach to the threat posed by North Korea at a town hall meeting with @AMCTheatres employees. https://t.co/OkxQAuINIoOne issue I’ve championed in Congress that I think we can all agree on - the government shouldn’t be able to read our emails and text messages without a warrant. Meanwhile, the Email Privacy Act has passed unanimously in the House 2x but sits idle in the Senate. https://t.co/EEMReHilTjI was born and raised here in Kansas, every day I’m focused on the issues that matter the most to Kansans, and I’m driven by ensuring our Kansas values are represented in the debates in Washington, DC. https://t.co/SnLLajQZCqMy goal every day is to figure out how we can come together every day as a country and figure out how to make sure everyone across the economic spectrum can achieve the American Dream. We are working on an economic growth agenda to create those opportunities. https://t.co/kFcsAkw3NtJoining @AMCTheatres employees for a town hall meeting this morning. All told, AMC employs about 1,000 people in #KS03. 

Fun fact: AMC sells 60 tons (!) of popcorn🍿 every day. https://t.co/4LQYQmHDY3This is the right move.

https://t.co/ogpM0GXHvY https://t.co/Vv8Flw2p4qIt’s become increasingly clear that their main objective was and continues to be sowing discord and division in our country and we must continue to be vigilant and unified in the face of those attacks.As I’ve said from the start of this investigation, I support Robert Mueller and know he will do a strong job. Today, he’s sent an important message to the Russians that those responsible for attempted interference in our elections will be brought to justice.@SenatorDole I'm proud of that work we've done and look forward to continuing to build upon it. Unfortunately, I believe today's vote to weaken the ADA was a step backward for people with disabilities and that's why I voted no on HR 620.Kansas has a rich history standing up &amp; fighting for individuals with disabilities. Our great @SenatorDole led the charge in the 1990s to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act, &amp; following in his footsteps this Congress has made great strides in new policies like the ABLE Act.Horrific news out of Florida. Praying for the victims, their loved ones, and the doctors and nurses currently saving lives as we speak. Thankful for the heroic first responders who prevented further loss of life today.As the Senate debates DACA and border security, I went to the House floor today to urge my colleagues in both houses of Congress to include high-skilled immigration reform in the final immigration legislative package. https://t.co/dsbS6xkgxfCurrently chairing the House floor.
