An excellent choice for Secretary of State. Mike understands our role in the international community &amp; will lead us strongly at the @StateDept. https://t.co/ytaz9ISpFGSo to recap, #Russia employed a nerve agent attack in a British city, putting thousands at risk. This reckless targeted hit-job was an attack against the United Kingdom, &amp; we must condemn it. https://t.co/TjVJMMxdzhCongratulations to our Golden Apple Winners &amp; thank you for all you do to inspire &amp; educate the next generation.

Tomorrow is Bob's 70th birthday, and his family will continue to ask: #WhatAboutBob. It's well past time that we get answers from the Iranian regime &amp; bring Bob home. @HelpBobLevinsonThe Kim regime is murderous, barbaric &amp; tyrannical. They cannot be trusted, and we cannot legitimize them. As the President moves forward on his meeting w/ #NorthKorea, I urge caution, and full denuclearization is critical.#Russian air strikes targeting civilians in #Syria, while the #Assad regime hijacks @UN aid convoys for the wounded &amp; suffering in #Ghouta. This is absolutely despicable &amp; must be stopped by us &amp; the international community. https://t.co/ifJcvG0MFbHappy #InternationalWomensDay! Today we celebrate women across #IL16 &amp; around the world who empower, encourage, &amp; inspire. Here‚Äôs to the generations of women who have made this world a better place, &amp; to those who are paving the way for future generations. https://t.co/UYEgZRRu3WYesterday, we moved one step closer to making the @FCC more efficient, transparent &amp; modernized.

From the old-man jokes at @HouseCommerce to this Top Gun #TeamKinzinger crew, it's been a great day to go 'over the hill' and into my 40s. üëç https://t.co/hXv3jUZQrCThree years ago today, Boris #Nemtsov was brutally murdered for his fervent calls for #democracy. What better way to remember this champion of freedom than to unveil the first commemoration in his honor‚Äîright across the street from the #Russian Embassy. Great job, @councilofdc! https://t.co/KhFMpFlrK5Proud to co-lead the #SOARact &amp; see it pass the House yesterday. This bill will raise awareness on #humantrafficking, educate our communities &amp; help more victims in #IL16 &amp; across the country. https://t.co/moBbURYlBCThis is hard to watch, but we cannot ignore this genocide in #Syria. Since 2011, #Assad has used chemical weapons 200+ times to attack innocent children, men &amp; women. This brutality is horrific, it is real &amp; we cannot let it become routine. #AssadMustGo https://t.co/azaZN3eP7LHeading down to the @HouseFloor to speak on the #SOARAct - a bill I've co-led w/ @RepCohen that raises awareness &amp; implements procedures to help identify #HumanTrafficking victims.
