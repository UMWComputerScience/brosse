Their voices and their footsteps will make a difference. üë£#MarchForLife #ProLife https://t.co/OdkZXVNlMpHumbled to see the House pass legislation I helped introduce to require healthcare professionals to provide care to babies who are born alive after a failed abortion attempt.

Learn more &gt;&gt; https://t.co/6aeFhnTsGPIn the wake of today‚Äôs Supreme Court announcement, the need for my e-fairness bill (HR2193) is more urgent than ever. If the Supreme Court rules in SD‚Äôs favor, it could become a marketplace free-for-all. My legislation provides a necessary fix. https://t.co/UkOBwQRqpLGrateful to work with @IvankaTrump to double the Child Tax Credit and keep the Child Care Credit. Here‚Äôs what our work means: If the old tax code was in place, a couple with 3 children making $78000 would owe $2600+ in taxes for 2018. With tax reform, their tax bill drops to $99. https://t.co/54rtOkbH8HLet‚Äôs pull aside the curtains and let the cherished stained glass shine through in the Fort Meade VA Hospital's chapel. https://t.co/M6lpkfHwiAWe need to fix gov‚Äôt programs that perpetuate poverty, and work requirements can help do that.

And paid maternity/paternity leave is being expanded. This is what we meant when we said tax reform was about making people's lives better. https://t.co/YKiUWxsiW5Proud to see provisions pass the House today that withdraw the government‚Äôs heavy hand and again reinforce our commitment to tribal sovereignty. I introduced the language back in 2011. https://t.co/7pndp8elLzLloyd from SF said this about tax reform: "This tax reform bill will help me and I am nowhere near rich... Keep something in mind, it is 'our money,' not the government‚Äôs money and we are better off managing it than they are." His full @argusleader letter: https://t.co/bzB06HcTXmThis is what #taxreform was designed to do. Many in SD will be seeing a direct tax cut of $1,000+. But on top of that, most of Great Western Bank‚Äôs employees will now be receiving a bonus &amp; better benefits as a result of tax reform.
