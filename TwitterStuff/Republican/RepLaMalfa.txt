In my recent small business owner survey, only 7% of business owners expect a decrease in sales while 72% are predicting an increase. https://t.co/MqjvcVNBu5In the spirit of #SmallBusinessWeek, I wanted to know how business owners in the North State view #TaxReform, as well as the state of small businesses in CA.

Federal employees need to get back to work, troops need to get paid, and states need money for #CHIP. The American people are the ones who pay the price for these political games. https://t.co/PrLVkJdULkThe #SchumerShutdown all started because Senate Democrats wanted to force through a hurried, unfinished, and unrelated immigration policy. We don't link immigration negotiations to funding the federal government. It's wrong and it's not fair to the American people. https://t.co/ty3bcS6cnoI spoke on the House floor today to share my thoughts on the ongoing Schumer Shutdown, as well as the classified FISA memo, which I believe should be released to the public as soon as responsibly possible. https://t.co/La7dLqx4pSDifference in Administrations: 2013 govt shutdown- Obama closes all parks and national monuments, even in DC, to prove a point. 2018- Admin doing everything possible to keep parks open to public use for visitors, marchers, tourists. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/YHUDGugRmmThere is nothing in this funding measure that Dems disagree with. Schumer and his followers have willfully shutdown the govt in the name of a completely unrelated immigration program that doesn’t expire until March. #SchumerShutdownThe American people are paying the price for the unnecessary #SchumerShutdown. Many govt workers will be furloughed, troops that are fighting to protect us will not get paid, and states get no money for CHIP.Let’s be clear. This is a shutdown caused solely by Senate Democrats. 60 votes required to fund the govt and Dems blocked it. Not only is it irresponsible, but it’s reckless. #SchumerShutdownTo my colleagues in the Senate - end this #SchumerShutdown. The American people are paying the price. https://t.co/c2OpEQxZFmI’m disappointed the Senate failed to agree on a government funding measure. Dems must stop holding our country hostage over unrelated immigration negotiations. #SchumerShutdown
