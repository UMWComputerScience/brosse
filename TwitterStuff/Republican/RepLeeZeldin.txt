I don‚Äôt subscribe to the pledge of many in Congress to oppose, obstruct, resist, impeach @realDonaldTrump on everything &amp; anything. That‚Äôs not the best path forward for USA.

For more info, contact my office at (631) 289-1097. Hope to see you there!When someone illegally enters US, we can (1) detain the family together; (2) detain adults &amp; minors separately; (3) detain the adults &amp; release the kids into US as UACs; or (4) release them all. I choose option 1. Congressional Dems are choosing option 4. Which do you prefer?Now up to 33 Members sponsoring H.Res.907, which I intro‚Äôd calling for a 2nd Special Counsel &amp; detailing misconduct at highest levels of DOJ/FBI re FISA abuse &amp; how/why the Clinton email probe ended &amp; Trump-Russia probe began. TY @RepRalphNorman for signing on this week!After 9/11, Donato Panico drove from his LI deli to Ground Zero to feed the 1st responders. In thanks, 1 of the 1st responders gave him a flag flown near the pile. This flag has also been flown in Iraq &amp; today I gave it to @realdonaldtrump in the Oval Office at Donato‚Äôs request. https://t.co/5GdEc60hmAIn the meantime, my advice for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to be detained for entering into the United States illegally is to not enter the United States illegally.The Flores decision will either need to be reconsidered in the courts or Congress will need to pass legislation to change fed law. I support whichever option can be done swiftly &amp; correctly so that families are detained together at the border.It‚Äôs also not good policy to immediately release families who enter our country illegally into our communities. I further believe that it would be wrong to detain the children in cages just like the Obama Admin did.I met tdy w @realDonaldTrump at the WH to talk about the issue of separating families at the border &amp; other imp immigr policies. I welcome the new EO as a pos step. It‚Äôs not good policy to separate children at our border from their parents &amp; release them into the US as UACs.Why is it easier to negotiate with Iran, China &amp; North Korea on issues like nuclear weapons, sanctions &amp; trade, then it is to get Congressional Dems to negotiate at all for a great bill on immigration?Strzok has left the building. #SwampCleaning https://t.co/05BlNG0UfwWhy is Peter Strzok still employed at the FBI? There really are only 2 appropriate courses of action that are called for from here (1) fired &amp; then prosecuted; or (2) prosecuted &amp; then fired. Was on @FoxNews tdy w @HarrisFaulkner to discuss.

Took the girls out to Montauk to support the @NavySEALfnd, an amazing org. that does so much to support our elite servicemembers &amp; their families. We also stopped by a true Montauk tradition - the Star Island Shark tournament! https://t.co/WpHLWMeFTXNow do Obama: https://t.co/ADezUyOsCC https://t.co/RFmevBCsn7Enforce the law, secure our borders &amp; stop illegal entry. Not a good policy to separate families at border. It creates more UACs in US. Best way to avoid trouble at border? Follow our rules &amp; don't enter US ILLEGALLY. Our laws are to be upheld &amp; respected, not ignored &amp; violated.If Trump caged kids just like Obama did he'd get slammed (he doesn't). If kids go free into US as UACs he gets slammed. Want to come w your family to US? Follow the rules &amp; enter legally. Every nation's backbone is its rule of law &amp; a nation w/out borders is not a nation.If anyone tells you the IG's report shows there was no political bias then to borrow a few legal terms‚û°Ô∏èthey are either being "willful", "negligent", or "reckless" w what really is an outright LIE. Don't take my word for it..or theirs...here's Exhibit A: https://t.co/Wl79qSwqt5What often gets lost in the complaints that the FBI looked into Huma‚Äôs laptop so late in the campaign was that Andrew McCabe &amp; Peter Strzok sat on those emails for several weeks trying to run out the clock to get past the Nov election.It has been exactly 1 yr since a gunman opened fire at the Congressional Republican Baseball Team‚Äôs practice &amp; tonight, against all odds, @SteveScalise &amp; his heroic Capitol Police detail are here, alive &amp; still serving exceptionally our great country! https://t.co/BYdzBlGv53Talking about friends w/benefits to make Strzok &amp; Page blush (Pg 430 &amp; Attachments G &amp; H). Massive leaking at the Bureau. Meanwhile, FBI employees receive from media free tix to sporting events, golf outings, free drinks &amp; meals &amp; more. https://t.co/YOFRt3MI54Peter Strzok should not be employed at the FBI as a waterboy, let alone as an FBI agent. Why does he still have a job at the Bureau? This tarnishes the great reputation of the amazing patriots up &amp; down the ranks at the FBI who actually pursue justice objectively &amp; responsibly.Happy 243rd Birthday to the @USArmy. The greatest Army in the world: past, present &amp; future! https://t.co/xhD1cmFLUIIG concludes Strzok's anti-Trump texts "not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate‚Äôs electoral prospects. This is antithetical to the core values of the FBI and (DOJ)."Today's IG report is further confirmation of so many points of my 12 page House Resolution 907, detailing misconduct at the highest levels of the DOJ/FBI. H.Res.907, which is now up to 32 total sponsors, also calls for the appointment of a 2nd Special Counsel.Here's the 568 pg DOJ Inspector General report: "A Review of Various Actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice in Advance of the 2016 Election" https://t.co/Wl79qSwqt5Peter Strzok, who launched counter intel probe on Trump campaign, texted "we'll stop" Trump from being elected. The reality is the invest. was launched bc Pres Trump became GOP nominee, was extended w/FISA abuse bc he was closer to winning &amp; became Special Counsel probe bc he wonToday is #FlagDay!

https://t.co/s2NJKj1dqUWhen the people on the other side of the negotiating table are laughing hysterically amongst themselves at just how much they completely rolled you in the negotiation, I'd take that as a pretty good clue that you just got horribly played as a total fool by those Iranians.If Mueller doesn't have evidence that @realDonaldTrump colluded with the Russians to win election, why not just say so? Those who created this Trump-Russia collusion cloud have the duty to remove it NOW if they still have NOTHING.AG @jeffsessions should reassess massive scope of his recusal, which is absurdly &amp; most unnecessarily broad. The Justice Dept works best w/ an Attorney General fully in charge. He's a good man allowing himself to be tied up, undercut, handcuffed &amp; silenced by others around him.Being US Secretary of State should never be viewed as simply a stepping stone to President of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. https://t.co/LUDTkYZrXSPlease stop playing Secretary of State Mr. Kerry.

Let's always cherish to the max the sacrifice of our military men &amp; women in defense of everything that makes our nation the greatest in the world. https://t.co/goauVyMZbuYday, I surprised local patrons @ShopRiteStores in Hauppauge as part of ‚ÄúUndercover Congressman‚Äù, during which I work local jobs to highlight the diverse occupations throughout the NY-1 community. During my visit, I worked at the deli counter, produce section and at checkout. https://t.co/2vo16ENziHOnus should be on Iran to Fix or Nix the nuclear deal. They can either (Fix it) correct the sunset provision &amp; verification regime &amp; end nefarious, illegal terrorist activities...or not (Nix it). Their call but status quo is not a 3rd option.How does @GregPittman1957, a Stoneman Douglas teacher, get away w/ comparing @KyleKashuv, a Jewish student at Stoneman Douglas, to Hitler, for not sharing the teacher's anti #2A gun control beliefs? So wrong. And this guy is getting paid to teach HISTORY of all subjects!Today, on #NationalPrescriptionDrugTakeBackDay, in an effort to prevent misplaced, stolen &amp; misused medications, you can safely dispose of your unused/expired prescription drugs at a location near you.

POTUS' strategy of max pressure, increased sanctions w even China's support &amp; military option on table is much more effective than "pretty please w cherry on top" weak kneed diplomacy towards America's adversaries. https://t.co/WEQ4ioO04nPeace on the Korean Peninsula? Denuclearization? Release of hostages? Yesterday looked brighter than the day before. Today looks brighter than yesterday. Keep up max pressure strategy &amp; let's get this done! Skeptical? Yes, but the future here is looking better than ever before.We finally have a U.S. Ambassador to Germany &amp; it couldn't have happened sooner, especially w/Chancellor Merkel about to arrive in DC. Congrats to @RichardGrenell on his important, time sensitive, necessary &amp; very well deserved confirmation!Ridiculous though that so many Senate Dems voted NO. Hillary Clinton received 94 votes. John Kerry received 94 as well. Mike Pompeo received 57, bc of this lighting our hair on fire "resistance" to oppose everything &amp; anything. That's exactly why they are in the minority."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo". I love the sound of that! Most importantly though, he's intelligent, competent, qualified, and talented. Mike Pompeo is not only our new Secretary of State, but a leader capable of being one of our best ever.In the House chamber now awaiting the arrival of French President @EmmanuelMacron to address a Joint Session of Congress, America &amp; the world. Looking forward to greeting him shortly &amp; hearing his thoughts, vision &amp; aspirations for our great alliance. https://t.co/2UP8hwbxgsAG @jeffsessions is a good man getting some bad advice. There is no basis for him to be recused entirely from all matters related to the 2016 election. None. Those around the AG should be helping him lead as opposed to convincing him to handcuff himself.
https://t.co/pF2afv4DHWGreat news! Very excited that @RichardGrennell will be getting confirmed this week as the next U.S. Ambassador to Germany...and just in time for Chancellor Merkel's visit to D.C. https://t.co/eu9kPT1VAzSent letter to @jeffsessions yest. w/@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @RepMattGaetz @RepDeSantis re no knock raid of Michael Cohen's residence &amp; office. No reason for this action against POTUS' personal atty outside scope of Mueller probe w/out AG's awareness, involvement &amp; signoff https://t.co/gg7Kzxi7pVIran Deal: "Fix it or nix it?". Wrong to think it needs to be Congress' call, our allies', or @POTUS'. Iran either fixes it or nixes it. 2 choices. Iran either lifts the sunset provision, strengthens verification regime &amp; ends other nefarious, illegal activities...or notSecs. Clinton &amp; Kerry both got 94 votes to head State Dept. Senate Dems destructively opposing Mike Pompeo's nomin to be next Sec of State is wrong call &amp; timing couldn't be worse. Pompeo can be one of our best ever! https://t.co/kcB7zqzfYDToday marks the 110th birthday of the @USArmyReserve! Proud to be a member of the great Army Reserve family for over a decade.

Mike Pompeo CAN, WILL &amp; MUST fix this immediately! https://t.co/CSAov7T40RCan't wait for Pompeo to fix @StateDept ASAP! Acting Asst Sec Satterfield claimed to me @HouseForeign that Iran isn't violating letter of JCPOA then refused to answer my ?s on ANY of the publicly known ways that's just not true (this guy runs bureau?!) https://t.co/atyk6KmnbfOur nation mourns the loss of an icon, a woman whose strength &amp; grace inspired those of every generation.

Watch here: https://t.co/1SwJmASNxmYesterday morning's mission to degrade Syria's chemical weapons program was limited, well executed, accurately targeted &amp; proportionate. Was on @FoxNews earlier today to discuss. https://t.co/I4NXUmQF5vYesterday, I voted YES to House Joint Resolution 2, a constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget.

Last week, I sat w/Holocaust survivor Bozenna Gilbride of Southampton to hear about her adversity, suffering, courage, &amp; survival. https://t.co/N5ynot2bHmDOJ/FBI shouldn't be opening/continuing/expanding investigations simply for winning election w/out evidence the candidate committed a crime to win the election. To be a tad more candid: This is an insider, dead end hack job still w/out a case for collusion.Trump-Russia probe became a Special Counsel probe, bc @RealDonaldTrump won the Presidency...so the FBI Director then illegally leaked classified info to the media to trigger a Special Counsel appointment.Trump-Russia probe was continued, bc @RealDonaldTrump was about to possibly win Presidency. It's clear why DOJ/FBI didn't want Nunes memo released. They broke rules and misled a FISA court to improperly secure a warrant to spy on a U.S. citizen.Make no mistake...Trump-Russia probe was launched, bc @RealDonaldTrump won GOP nomination for Pres. It's clear why DOJ/FBI didn't want to turn over memo opening the investigation. They didn't come up w/ a sufficient alternative justification to start the probe.It was a great privilege this AM on the House floor to recognize and honor the amazing, selfless efforts of the Patriot Guard Riders @thePGR. They stand for those who stood for us; always there for America's veterans. https://t.co/CcrMwZWPmqBest wishes &amp; good luck to @SpeakerRyan.

Extraordinarily talented pickVoted NO on Omni, a 2k+ pg, $1.3 tril spending bill US can't afford, released just last night. There are many pos elements in bill.

Filled w/good, bad, ugly &amp; a whole lot of each w/unimaginable price tagMake no mistake about it, the NSC works for @realDonaldTrump. It's his team, vision &amp; foreign policy decisions.

These lives were the best of the best of our proud nation!It's a crime to lie to DOJ/FBI. Ppl do it &amp; then get charged for it. Should McCabe be held to a lower, same or higher standard?

Feeling so blessed today &amp; every day to be able to live in the greatest nation on earth!WH didn't try to bury Schiff's memo. Schiff loaded up memo w/sources-methods to play this exact game. Redactions were made that didn't change any of Schiff's claims &amp; then memo was released. @realDonaldTrump should feel vindicated public is learning how #FullofSchiff this guy is https://t.co/Hu66Yr3THxMUST READ: Here's my Op-Ed in tomorrow's edition of USA Today re FISA Abuse. So much wasn't disclosed to FISA Judges that should have been. Omitting material facts &amp; obscurely burying hints of others in footnotes is wrong in secret court for secret warrant to spy on any American https://t.co/sghK5slwVeBroward Sheriff Israel told @jaketapper this AM he grades his own leadership performance as "amazing". The buck in his dept apparently doesn't make it to the top. Having any sense of reality will be an important trait for the next Sheriff of Broward County https://t.co/Wlm1Q1fNAwIf a teacher wants to skillfully &amp; safely arm themselves, let them! If a teacher doesn't want to then don't make them.FISA collection on an American citizen is an extremely powerful tool &amp; any abuse of that process is a massive problem that requires transparency, accountability &amp; solutions. Addressing this issue should be of concern for any American, regardless of one's political affiliation.Also not disclosed to FISA Ct: Yahoo story's source was also Chris Steele, Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS, Connection between Ohr &amp; Steele, Page &amp; Papadopoulos weren't associates, etc. DOJ/FBI had duty to disclose whole story for secret warrant to spy on a U.S. citizen.Schiff Memo just released. The reality remains that FBI/DOJ went to secret ct w/secret docs for a secret warrant to spy on a U.S. citizen relying on an unverified dossier w/out disclosing that DNC/Clinton campaign paid for it &amp; source was unreliable &amp; about to get fired.Sheriff Israel, 4 more of your people did the same thing &amp; also waited outside? Holy smokes. What kind of an operation are you running down there wild man? Unconscionable.As part of this year‚Äôs #BlackHistoryMonth theme, we celebrate ‚ÄúAfrican Americans in Times of War‚Äù. From the Revolutionary War to the War on Terror, African Americans have served our country courageously &amp; selflessly contributed to making America the great nation it is today. https://t.co/BAAqrxIafWGreat news! It was just announced the U.S. embassy in Israel will move to Jerusalem by 5/14. Jerusalem is #Israel's capital &amp; moving the embassy there is a key next step for Israel‚Äôs sovereignty &amp; security. TY to @RealDonaldTrump for following through on this important promise!Yesterday, I visited @ESBOCES Gary D. Bixhorn Tech Center to learn more about Hunter Shelters &amp; the STAR Mobile Battery Energy Storage System pilot program, which provides shelter, electricity &amp; clean water during natural disaster emergencies. https://t.co/ogelr0N0i7Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel on former "School Resource Officer of the Year" Deputy Scot Peterson: He should have ‚Äúwent in. Addressed the killer. Killed the killer.‚Äù Spot on Sheriff Israel!Regime change though is not the United States' responsibility. Great Syrians must be empowered to take charge of their own destiny. Rebuild their homes, secure their communities, change the direction of their nation &amp; then prosper w/stability, passion, determination &amp; vision.Assad must be replaced, but not with another Assad. Only then will many great Syrians feel comfortable enough to return home to help rebuild their own country. These are the doctors, teachers, community leaders, etc. who are refugees in Jordan &amp; elsewhere. They want to go home!HUGE advancements last 12 months destroying ISIS in Syria. Job isn't finished yet, but this may be our biggest &amp; most underrated, underreported military success of the past year. We are so lucky to have such amazing warriors serving in defense of the greatest nation on earth!Thank you to everyone who came out today to my Westhampton Beach Mobile Office Hours! Missed Mobile Office Hours? Call my office at (631) 289-1097 to schedule a meeting after work, on the weekend or a time most convenient for you https://t.co/AVhUKFFCZCPls join me for Mobile Office Hrs tomorrow, from 11AM-2PM, @ Westhampton Beach Fire Dept. If you have any questions/concerns, or need help on a federal issue, come sit down w/either myself or a staff member for a 1on1 or small group meeting. Questions-&gt;Call 631-289-1097We must do all in our power to stop MS-13 &amp; gang violence. That's why I introduced the Protecting Our Communities from Gang Violence Act, HR 5065, to revoke the naturalization of those involved in gang activity prior to or w/in 10 yrs of being naturalized. https://t.co/v6ORhYoGiO10 key ?s by @HouseIntelComm to sr intel community &amp; other agency officials re DNC funded, unverified Steele dossier used in secret court for secret warrant to spy on an American. Media should also be asking these important questions! What did Clapper &amp; others know re FISA abuse? https://t.co/8YxuMH6fbXAll of the signs were there that Cruz shouldn't have had access to ANY firearm at all. The threats &amp; indicators were obvious enough to have prevented this terribly sad tragedy.Happy #PresidentsDay to the great American Presidents who have fearlessly &amp; selflessly guided us through times of war, depression, peace &amp; prosperity. America is a stronger and more resilient nation b/c of their leadership. https://t.co/IWQEzV9a2DAs for the Russians, they need to knock it off. They are doing this all over the globe as a disruptive, meddling force against peace &amp; stability. They have ZERO business even thinking about interfering in an American election!We have heard @realDonaldTrump repeat over &amp; over again that he did not collude w/the Russians. After Rosenstein's statement today, the extraordinarily dishonest narrative otherwise needs to end. Many in media &amp; anti-Trumpers playing right into Russia's hands.Rosenstein: "There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the [Russians'] conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election."Had a blast giving students from my alma mater, @ualbany @RockefellerColl, a behind the scenes night tour of the US Capitol Building which included visiting the Speaker‚Äôs Balcony and House and Senate chambers. https://t.co/o6m2Knkvf7I support law abiding citizens having the ability to possess firearms to protect themselves, their families, other loved ones &amp; property. Lunatics manifesting violent criminal intentions to murder w/firearms should have access to none.Praying for all involved in today's Florida HS shooting. Our great law enforcement &amp; first responders have been hard at work exceptionally taking control, quickly tracking down the suspect, &amp; rendering first aid to anyone in need.Celebrating &amp; rewarding illegal immigration will only result in even more illegal immigration, especially w/o necessary reforms. Every nation's backbone is its rule of law. Right now, millions of ppl aren't in our country who want to be bc they follow &amp; respect our laws/process.Yesterday I hosted another Coffee w/Your Congressman in Bellport, followed by a Lunch w/Lee Town Hall in Riverhead, &amp; then a Pizza &amp; Policy Town Hall in Westhampton Beach. TY to all who attended! To participate in a future meeting, contact my office @ 631-289-1097. https://t.co/WpIhDyiefkAt what point along the way did it become the "extreme" point of view for stewards of tax dollars to care about being fiscally responsible?U.S. naturalization is a privilege; not a right and gang violence must end! I'm proposing that gang activities result in a revocation of naturalization.Today, on President #AbrahamLincolnsBirthday, we honor a legend in American history who tirelessly pursued a unified nation with a "government of the people, by the people, for the people". https://t.co/dcnBGLqIMo#FullOfSchiff: Knows well he can make same exact pts w/out compromising sources &amp; methods, but instead chose to load up his memo in way to manufacture blame against @realDonaldTrump &amp; exec branch for doing right thing. Dems need to not play games, fix their memo &amp; make public.Schiff memo purposefully filled up w/sources-methods he knew would need to be redacted. After lying re how majority memo would endanger natl sec &amp; compromise good sources-methods, he suddenly became clueless on same exact assessment of his own memo. Teammates in media play along.With #Olympics2018 getting started, wishing the best to all competitors, but especially rooting of course for the amazing athletes from the greatest nation on earth, go #TeamUSA!  Time to medal up at #PyeongChang2018, ready to compete with the best in the world!! https://t.co/Usg3joXKxAOur great nation simply cannot afford the price tag on this Senate budget bill as is &amp; the process was just as flawed. Senator @RandPaul stated many correct, principled &amp; necessary points this evening. Congress can &amp; must do better.Senator @RandPaul is making a whole lot of sense right now on Senate floor. He's ripping the band-aid right off &amp; simply delivering one hard truth after another. He's probably upsetting a ton of people for this, but so much of this really needed to be said &amp; just as he said it!TY to @TGowdySC @RepRatcliffe &amp; @DevinNunes for helping explain FISA abuse that took place. No disclosure to court of DNC &amp; Clinton campaign funding of unverified dossier &amp; improper use of bad, compromised source (Steele), etc. Public deserves the truth! https://t.co/O6Wg9ez3do8+ hrs @NancyPelosi has been delivering a 1 min speech on House floor celebrating illegal immigration. Now if only those hours were also spent listening, negotiating &amp; compromising in good faith w/her GOP colleagues just imagine the possibilities finalizing a great immig bill.Need a reminder why @HouseDemocrats are in the minority? Using her "1 min." of time, @NancyPelosi has been speaking on House floor since 10AM re illegal immigration. Not to end it, but to praise it! They voted yest. against keeping gov't open &amp; funding military for rest of '18.Schiff loaded his memo w/ sources/methods that he knows he shouldn't have &amp; will be redacted by DOJ/FBI. He also knows his teammates in media will give him a pass &amp; even totally play along. Give public max info, but don't play games w/the process. That's how this all started.Did you know nearly 2 million NYers rely on #CommunityHealthCenters? Met w/ @HRHCare, which has 6 CHCs in NY-1 alone, to discuss the NYers who rely on their services. Voted again yesterday to fully fund CHCs for 2 yrs https://t.co/0sOTCKsys6This evening, following my meeting with @realDonaldTrump today at the White House, I spoke with @cvpayne on @FoxBusiness re the topics of the meeting: MS-13, gang violence &amp; illegal immigration. https://t.co/AJaYhFcXF6Through all of this we must never forget that our law enforcement ranks at DOJ &amp; FBI are filled up w/truly great Americans who love their jobs, love our rule of law, &amp; perform their work exceptionally. The misconduct of a few should not be used as a reflection on all.Secret warrant at secret court to spy on a US citizen relied on unverified dossier w/out disclosing (1) DNC &amp; Clinton campaign funded (2) Steele was bad &amp; compromised source (3) known conflicts &amp; anti-Trump bias at highest levels of DOJ/FBI, etc. So important for govt to provide!Great meeting today w/@realDonaldTrump &amp; @SecNielsen at WH to discuss our critical efforts to combat MS-13, gang violence and illegal immigration. This issue is especially personal for Long Islanders as well as our entire nation. Watch my remarks here: https://t.co/GjZ2U5GAzlGreat to join NY high schoolers this past Sat. competing in the Annual Bay Scallop Bowl at @stonybrooku. During this ocean science academic competition, students from across the state competed to win a place at the National Ocean Sciences Bowl in Boulder, CO. https://t.co/xkjtFnPiYE#FullofSchiff, cont.: Refuses to admit that (5) DOJ/FBI didn't reveal to FISA Court that unverified dossier was paid for by DNC; and (6) Dirty dossier was collected by bad, compromised source. There's a lot more where this is coming from &amp; these obstructionist games need to end! https://t.co/IX6cYZgZdE#FullofSchiff: Majority Memo (1) couldn't be released bc it would threaten natl sec; (2) would compromise sources &amp; methods; (3) was materially changed. All untrue. (4) Leaking confidential info to press in middle of @DonaldJTrumpJr's testimony. Public sees through this! https://t.co/IX6cYZgZdEEnjoyed attending this past weekend the Suffolk County Dental Society‚Äôs Annual Give a Kid a Smile event, to see all they have been accomplishing to provide low-income children with free dental exams, cleanings and fluoride treatments. https://t.co/PRakMcBDJKNothing changes fact DOJ/FBI used unverified dossier in a secret court to obtain a secret warrant to spy on a US citizen. No disclosure to court that DNC paid for it &amp; was assembled by a bad, compromised source. There needs to be transparency &amp; accountability.I have zero issue w/any of Schiff's points coming out if he changes some of it to say the same exact thing w/out unnecessarily compromising sources &amp; methods. Let's also release as much of the underlying FISA file as possible. Public is smart enough to form correct conclusions.Friends don't let friends on @HouseIntelComm compromise good sources &amp; methods. Schiff deliberately &amp; unnecessarily loaded up his memo w/many sources &amp; methods that shouldn't be released &amp; he knows it. There's a 0% chance this isn't deliberate to play games, meddle &amp; obstruct.Congratulations to the #PhiladelphiaEagles on their first #SuperBowl victory! Great game &amp; huge win.The duty of gov't to provide all facts, even if facts are against govt's own argument, is most important in FISA Courts. This is a secret court where secret docs are used to get a secret warrant to spy at times on US citizens. Must never be weaponized or abused!DOJ/FBI has legal obligation to present FISA Court w/all info known or should‚Äôve been known to US gov't. Failure to do so is a violation that the Court can hold those responsible in contempt for. https://t.co/8h2OhSRrxhSchiff said memo would endanger natl sec. It did not. He said it contained sources &amp; methods that couldn't be released. He was lying. He said it was materially altered. It was not. Time &amp; again he repeatedly feeds media &amp; public TPs that are just not true. Why's he running point?McCabe did in fact testify under oath that there would not have been a FISA warrant if not for the dossier. It was recorded.Using secret docs in a secret court to spy must have highest safeguards to protect national sec AND civil liberties. FISA abuse is wrong. Almost all in DOJ/FBI are amazing, but the process &amp; misconduct at highest levels here must be addressed w transparency &amp; accountability.W/out dossier, there would've been no FISA warrant. Was admitted under oath by McCabe. DOJ/FBI already knew dossier's source was unreliable &amp; shouldn't be used, but filed applic w/it anyways. Waited until after to fire Steele. Then applied for extensions on warrant anyways.During #IranProtests, a young mother named Vida took off her hijab in a courageous act of protest against the Iranian regime. Arrested &amp; imprisoned, she inspired women across #Iran to do the same, rekindling a movement the Iranian gov. seeks to snuff out. #WhereIsShe(4) Changes made to memo were very minor, including changes requested by FBI &amp; House minority. (5) This isn't an attack on the institutions. The end result will be better institutions. (6) No good sources &amp; methods will be revealed. It will reveal bad ones though.Another reason to #ReleaseTheMemo: A lot of just really bad, inaccurate info being disseminated in meantime. (1) This isn't the "Nunes memo". He didn't draft it &amp; it's not his memo. (2) This is strictly about FISA abuse &amp; misconduct. (3) Its content is actually 100% non-partisan~@RealDonaldTrump should declassify &amp; #ReleaseTheMemo ASAP as is. Public wants more info, not less, re FISA abuse &amp; who is responsible. Transparency &amp; accountability for really great, historic, legendary &amp; important agencies!UPDATE: Train back on the move. Grateful for our amazing first responders, police, and doctors. Praying for everyone injured in today's Amtrak crash https://t.co/sk5h1fGX6RI'm ok. TY to all checking in. Was on Amtrak train that just had the accident. Praying for those hurt. Great doctors &amp; 1st responders stepping up quick &amp; expertly.Tonight, during the #StateoftheUnion, @POTUS highlighted many important accomplishments, challenges &amp; opportunities impacting our nation. He also discussed how our great country will rise to tackle the daunting needs we still face. https://t.co/nGWdxZBQLCIt's a packed house here in the historic, beautiful US Capitol building anxiously awaiting @POTUS' 1st #SOTU at 9PM! So proud to have Smithtown‚Äôs Donato Panico as my guest. https://t.co/WHafSFyjNRI believe @realDonaldTrump should declassify &amp; release #FISAAbuseMemo now. Public wants us to #ReleaseTheMemo! Also, Members just got to read Schiff memo for 1st time tdy. Majority memo about FISA Abuse. Schiff memo about damage control. Public wants only facts &amp; truth, no spin!Tonight on the House floor, I spoke in favor of this evening's @HouseIntelComm vote to #ReleaseTheMemo. @realDonaldTrump should certify the immediate release of the #FISAAbuseMemo! https://t.co/4vFgxasUfvIt truly doesn't get any more insane than the @HouseDemocrats &amp; @RepAdamSchiff asking to declassify &amp; release a memo to the public just now that they wouldn't even allow the House Intel majority members to read before voting.(1) I haven't seen the Schiff memo (2) I have no idea what it says (3) It hasn't been made available to me (4) I'm not aware of it being made available to anyone in House (5) I can't even confirm it exists yet. The opp is true for the #FisaAbuseMemo made avail week before lastAll across our country Sanctuary Cities are taking millions in federal $$$ while ignoring fed immigration laws. This needs to end! I cohosted @FoxNews' @OutnumberedFNC to discuss. https://t.co/HOllmzm6VDA house cleaning of Obama holdover, biased &amp; partisan top leadership of DOJ-FBI is in order. These great, imp &amp; historic agencies will rebound fast, but not 1st w/out transparency &amp; accountability. Misconduct took place w how/why Clinton probe ended &amp; Trump-Russia probe began.Such an honor to nominate these young men &amp; women to our nations service academies. At such a young age, they have already demonstrated their commitment to the values of hard work &amp; dedication, &amp; their eagerness to serve our country is inspiring. Congratulations! https://t.co/OnnpASvBHvI joined @kilmeade on @foxnewsradio to discuss President Trump's trip to Davos, his decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, taxes, and our nation's broken immigration system. Listen below. https://t.co/DozVyheM82It would be "grossly negligent" (AKA "extremely careless") NOT to #ReleaseTheMemo. The American public is smarter than many give them credit for &amp; very much want to know all about this FISA abuse. Do it this week!On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we reflect on the atrocity against humanity that occurred several decades ago &amp; are reminded that silence and indifference only provides undeserving protection for the inexcusable, horrible acts of others. #NeverAgain https://t.co/bCXsD86m6pAs part of my most recent ‚ÄúUndercover Congressman‚Äù, today I served up cups of joe to surprised local patrons at Sunny's Riverhead Diner and Grill.

You are such an amazing pro &amp; I really enjoyed every min of today's #Outnumbered. Count me in for that #ZeldinReturn. Lol. Love it! https://t.co/oLSpjoj7sbReally enjoyed being today's #OLG on @OutnumberedFNC @FoxNews today w/@SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @MelissaAFrancis &amp; Marie.

Tune in at noon as we discuss the top news of the day. https://t.co/9eSHpzlh3SNo way those Strzok and Page texts are actually unobtainable &amp; no chance those texts won't be providing very important, highly relevant and absolutely necessary info re how/why Trump-Russia probe was launched. #FindTheTexts https://t.co/erQA6fW67xSmithtown's Donato Panico is going to @realDonaldTrump's #StateOfTheUnion! After the 9/11 attacks, deli owner Donato drove to Ground Zero to feed first responders. Today, he stopped by my #MobileOfficeHours to discuss his org. @Heros4OurHeroes where I asked him to be my guest. https://t.co/8023YN2pqyThere will need to be a new Special Counsel assigned. We cannot expect the DOJ &amp; FBI to properly investigate themselves w/so much significant, mounting evidence of misconduct at the highest levels re how and why the Clinton probe ended &amp; Trump-Russia probe began.It needs to be known how/why the Clinton probe ended &amp; how/why the Trump-Russia probe began. Raw truth, only facts, &amp; total transparency. #FindTheTexts https://t.co/2NxPPiG5PfI can't for the life of me think of one positive thing this gov't shutdown actually accomplished. To see so many Dems vote to continue it just now was even crazier. Time to move on to more noble pursuits everyone! https://t.co/f4sIOLrvLKSomething very suspicious w these missing 5 mths of Strzok and Page texts. While ppl chase ridiculous shiny objects obsessively trying to prove President Trump colluded w Russia, more dots are connected that the crimes actually committed were to get this whole thing launched.Color me skeptical that the Strzok-Page texts are actually "lost". I'd predict they are a million times more likely to fall under the categories of "revealing" &amp; "damaging" instead of "lost". In this order, what's needed is transparency, accountability, &amp; regaining public trust.Congress needs to (1) subpoena from the cell service Strzok &amp; Page text messages; &amp; (2) request FBI perform full forensic exam of their employees' phones to see if they can recover the messages. Let the line shine brightly on the truth!Cosponsored new bill w @RepMcSally to ensure when there is a #GovtShutdown military &amp; fed law enforcement get paid &amp; Congress doesn't; an important reversal of current law. In the meantime, I informed the House to withhold my pay until the shutdown ends https://t.co/tEOOoV0VHa3 Great Americans: @RepDevinNunes @TGowdySC @RepGoodlatte having meetings to responsibly plan next steps w regards to shocking #FISAmemo. I'm calling to #ReleaseTheMemo &amp; all of the relevant sourced material. #ReleaseTheFileDid you know that during a #GovtShutdown Members of Congress still get paid?! Not me. I told @CAOHouse to withhold my pay. It's crazy to me that Members of Congress get paid while military service members do not. https://t.co/dSQDkENvYTIt's critical that the #FISAMemo be released ASAP w/ALL related sourced material. Some only want Americans to get their info through @HouseDemocrats‚Äô #SchifftyLeaks. The rest of us believe Americans deserve transparent access to the very core #ReleaseTheMemo AND #ReleaseTheFile https://t.co/KppRTuJOeOJoined @RepMattGaetz &amp; other House colleagues sending letter to @HouseIntelComm to #ReleaseTheMemo. The American people deserve the truth. Don't pull the wool over their eyes. #ReleaseTheFile #FISAMemo https://t.co/a62IyDeDCDThe American public deserves the truth. We should not hide the truth from them. They've waited too long. Do not pull the wool over their eyes. Show them the facts. They deserve nothing less. #ReleaseTheMemo #ReleaseTheFile #FISAMemo https://t.co/vHCNOd0GriIn a few mins, just after 9AM, I will be speaking on the House floor, calling for the immediate release of the classified #FISAMemo as well as ALL related material sourced in the doc. #ReleaseTheMemo #ReleaseTheFile. Watch here: https://t.co/1SwJmASNxmNot only must the classified memo I read at HPSCI today be publicly released w/out delay by @HouseIntelComm but also ALL related material sourced out in the memo. #ReleaseTheMemo #ReleaseTheFileImmediately #ReleaseTheMemo #FISAMemo &amp; ALL relevant material sourced in it. Every American needs to know the truth! We wouldn't be revealing any sources &amp; methods that we shouldn't; only feds' reliance on bad sources &amp; methods.Releasing this classified info doesn't compromise good sources &amp; methods. It reveals the feds' reliance on bad sources &amp; methods.Just read the classified doc @HPSCI re FISA abuse. I'm calling for its immediate public release w/relevant sourced material. The public must have access ASAP! #TransparencyThis AM I participated on a #bipartisan panel w/ @RepTomSuozzi &amp; answered constituents' questions at the Annual Long Island Economic Survey &amp; Opinion Poll Executive Breakfast, co-hosted by AVZ Certified Public Accountants &amp; @LIBN. https://t.co/npNqEJ8LRr
