Appreciate tweets &amp; questions. Happy to engage constituents in constructive dialogue &amp; ignore those who simply rant obscenities or partisan talking points (downside of Twitter expanding beyond 140 characters). Time to drive back to #SouthJersey. See you at community events. FrankImmigration is deeply complex issue, policy AND politics. Attempts failed w/ Rs controlled WH/Congress in 05/06; w/ R in WH &amp; D controlled Congress in 07/08; and w/ Ds controlled WH/Congress in 09/10. Last real bipartisan shot (13/14) passed Senate. Some R/D moderates talking now https://t.co/DfCZ8Yp5GYCriticizing for retirement = same who criticized about term limits. When is good time to retire...+1, 3, 5 terms? Reality is House GOP rules restrict my ability to chair aviation subcom = critical to #SouthJersey...&amp; off Intel Comm...&amp; my solutions-based approach scarce here now https://t.co/8by2XDlyYXTrue statement for both political parties. Though hopeful some solid bipartisan bills will finish before fall campaign season including FAA Authorization, clean extension of flood insurance program, $$ for veterans &amp; military personnel... https://t.co/w42MDODtu9+ Best beaches + Great people + Charming, welcoming communities = Every reason to visit the #JerseyShore and #SouthJersey this summer with friends &amp; family. https://t.co/oqffI91tSCLaurie - Attempts on # of issues (immigration, infrastructure, healthcare) bring like-minded Rs &amp; Ds together &amp; hopefully more in future. However, w/o leadership buy-in from both sides, agreements reached don't get vote. Both sides too focused on politics than policy, regrettably https://t.co/gAwhyLour3GREAT WORK Chris on the bill in Trenton. Substantial opportunities for #SouthJersey &amp; industry leaders to cement footprint of aviation future at new National Aviation Research &amp; Technology Park (opening in the coming months) https://t.co/6uidmKrLtC @StocktonARTP https://t.co/12fDp9V2DtFinishing up votes on FY19 Defense Appropriations bill then headed back to #SouthJersey for excitement of openings of @HardRockHCAC &amp; @TheOceanAC. Media reports suggest up to 1 Million people visiting Atlantic City this holiday weekend to check out new offerings.John - Dems needs to recognize they are in minority &amp; compromising means both sides give. Just as GOP cannot get every policy (despite what Freedom Caucus says). I always take bipartisanship road to achieve real-world results for #SouthJersey. Proud of accomplishments &amp; legacy. https://t.co/FrWGAXY9kSExciting news! CONGRATS to Christina, Chioma &amp; Daniel on pushing the boundaries of science &amp; learning. Keep reaching for the stars - they aren't so far away anymore. Frank https://t.co/hChmUFAmJ6Joining @987TheCoast at 8am to talk local Cape May County &amp; national issues. Tune in #SouthJerseyI am disappointed House is unable to come together for a bipartisan solution to the ongoing failures in our immigration system.It authorizes &amp; appropriates billions in federal $$ for border security enhancements including physical structures, deployment of technology, &amp; additional personnel.  It reforms &amp; eliminates multiple visa programs which have been increasingly abused.Today‚Äôs bill codifies into law that parents &amp; children detained at U.S.-Mexico border not be separated. It provides certainty for DACA recipients, who came here through no fault of their own, so that they can continue to live &amp; work in our great country that many have only known.I voted YES on Border Security &amp; Immigration Reform because to vote no = reaffirm status quo of nation‚Äôs immigration laws which are not working by any metric/observation. Bill is not perfect nor everything I would choose it to be; compromises are necessary to advance good policy.Thx for calling in #SouthJersey. Appreciate questions on North Korea, Middle East peace, National Security team &amp; upcoming elections. Hour always seems to fly by. 

Will be joining @987TheCoast at 8am tomorrow to talk Cape May County issues.Morning #SouthJersey. Calling into @WPG1450 at 7am for monthly ‚ÄúAsk the Congressman‚Äù segment.

I support his mission now as I did when he was appointed. Today‚Äôs declassified revelations must not distract from critical national security work still to do. FrankToday‚Äôs memo outlines actions taken by specific individuals at Justice Department &amp; FBI related to FISA surveillance warrants. It DOES NOT undermine outstanding work of vast majority of men &amp; women at FBI or intelligence community. Their critical national security work continues.After available to full House, I voted to allow Republican-drafted memo from @HouseIntelComm be sent to President for declassification &amp; made public.

Frank https://t.co/TLF8F6oOMALong night. Shared my reaction here &amp; on Facebook. Memorable final #StateOfTheUnion &amp; great to be in House Chamber for some very special guests including parents of Otto Warmbier. Truly touching bipartisan moment. Drive back to #SouthJersey early tomorrow.Senate is going to lead on immigration &amp; anything that passes has to be bipartisan. Haven‚Äôt seen any proposal in legislative language but encouraged both sides realize addressing DACA &amp; border security have to go hand in hand to win approval. Support finding solution. Frank https://t.co/I5iNSveLAaThen you didn‚Äôt pay attention close enough. Full stop. Frank https://t.co/UrW31t7m9HDespite what the media reports, I still believe there remains an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation to address and resolve some critical issues our country faces. If we step away from partisan talking points and tweets, there is more that unites us than divides us.While I clearly disagreed w/ some policies due to neg impact in my district, I stand willing to work w/ admin to improve #SouthJersey residents' lives, including fair trade, reduce Rx drug cost, provide for our veterans, support law enforcement &amp; strengthen national security.From rebuilding our military &amp; crumbling infrastructure to immigration, President Trump continues to tackle head on some of nation‚Äôs most pressing issues; Congress should follow his lead.Appreciate tweets #SouthJersey.

Also post on my Facebook page. https://t.co/HovDSMJKpbMet w/ you &amp; many who peacefully assemble at my Mays Landing office weekly &amp; countless other #SouthJersey residents.

Frank https://t.co/eVueAzgc5UI've never phoned it in during 23 years of representing #SouthJersey in Congress &amp; not about to start in my final year. Proud of my record of putting people before politics. Nothing has changed nor will it. Frank https://t.co/GqMUfsC3zhCathy - Agree goal not only find out what happened w/ Russian meddling but how to prevent future attacks. Always said facts lead where they lead &amp; declassified public report must be issued. Proven guilt, not partisan leanings. should dictate above all. Some Rs &amp; Ds need reminding https://t.co/w67p0fbffUI guess you missed that FBI Director Wray &amp; senior FBI counterterrorism staff reviewed GOP memo Sun/Mon &amp; were asked about any inaccuracies or jeopardizing national security, they said No. Dem memo should also be reviewed for such requirements. Right? https://t.co/aFDQNSJXb0Congressional investigations into Russian meddling in 2016 election continue.
Special prosecutor Mueller investigation continues. Nothing has detracted from important work despite erroneous reporting &amp; anonymous "sources". Frank https://t.co/cd1oVaJLvzMy final #StateOfTheUnion sitting next to good friend &amp; colleague @RepPeteKing. Lots of good memories over the years https://t.co/PLQwRW2kkHInaccurate. I read Dem memo last night &amp; voted to allow non-Intel Committee members in House to review document. Unanimous vote actually (despite selective media reporting on full proceedings). Dem Memo following same House procedures as GOP Memo if to be publicly released. Frank https://t.co/LLAcKhWIXnOdd assessment...You read memos from both GOP &amp; Dem Committee staff as I have? Questionable actions taken by some in intel community should be made public. Process in place &amp; being followed. FBI Director &amp; senior staff reviewed Sun/Mon before vote. FYI: NJ is home &amp; staying :-) https://t.co/ply5puBcdiYes I've read the Dem memo last night &amp; voted to allow non-Intel Committee members in House review document. Unanimous vote actually (despite selective media reporting on full proceedings). Dem Memo following same House procedures as GOP Memo. Frank https://t.co/Ez0rUgJDbTThx @HarryHurley for another great program &amp; opportunity for #SouthJersey residents to call w/ their questions. Headed to Intel Committee now for additional classified briefings. Will be back on Twitter later today in preparation for President Trump‚Äôs first #StateoftheUnionAbsolutely wrong conclusion for all Intelligence &amp; reporting I‚Äôve seen.

We all have a responsibility to reject hatred and fight oppression at home &amp; abroad.Agree fix for DACA must be found. Supportive of those brought to USA thru no fault of own should be allowed to stay. Coupled w/ border security initiatives, real chance at broad bipartisan agreement. However furloughing 800k+ federal employees not solution https://t.co/H5wuVBHele https://t.co/oXmdFAQNnwKim - Senate Dems voted down Friday a 6yr CHIP authorization (its longest since program created) to then agree to it today after shutting gov down for 3 days. Only thing changed is length of CR to keep gov open (3 weeks) as negotiations on budget &amp; DACA cont. Shutdown = pointless https://t.co/uRbV6WSGzVSenate FINALLY acting to reopen federal gov. House will vote later today - I will vote YES - and my offices will return to full staffing Tuesday morning. My fourth (&amp; hopefully final) shutdown during my time in Congress. NEVER good option &amp; this one was particularly pointless.Marlene - I have reviewed the documents &amp; support their public release. Frank https://t.co/5DJtAN5YVUI remained in Washington throughout weekend &amp; will remain until government opens. My offices are open but appreciate patience as more than half my staff is furloughed w/o pay along w/ thousands of #SouthJersey employees &amp; contractors at FAA Tech Center &amp; other federal facilitiesWhile 535 members each have own legislative priorities &amp; would want additional non-related items included, simply no justification for voting against proposal. Latest &amp; completely avoidable example of Congress‚Äô inability to work together &amp; accept good &gt; pursuing perfect. FrankI have always argued shutting down government is NEVER a good option. Failing to pass a bill that keeps government open &amp; authorizes Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for 6 years ‚Äì a bill w/ broad support from Democrats &amp; Republicans ‚Äì is irresponsible &amp; frankly insane.Senate‚Äôs inexcusable inaction delays services to our veterans &amp; seniors, leaves in limbo thousands of #SouthJersey federal employees/contractors &amp; their families, and threatens planning for critical national security ops while leaving brave men/women of military serving w/o pay.Additionally, my Washington &amp; Mays Landing offices will open during normal business hours though with reduced staff due to furloughs. Furthermore I will return to @USTreasury my salary for days government closed as I did during 2013 shutdown. FrankIf Senate fails to act before midnight deadline &amp; government shuts down, I will remain ready to vote in Washington rather than continue on planned official Intel Committee trip overseas as part of CIA Subcommittee oversight duties.It is deeply disappointing - and entirely avoidable - that we again find ourselves at brink of another government shutdown. As I have always said shutting down government is NEVER a good option.DACA solution &amp; border security should be addressed together &amp; compromise deal can &amp; should be reached, but this is separate issue from funding/budget caps. They shouldn't be tied together &amp; threaten a real federal gov shutdown. Not helpful for those negotiating in good faith. https://t.co/4y1FH4al6WIf Senate Dems allowed annual appropriations bills to come up for Senate floor debate/vote prior to Sept 30th (end of fiscal year), then short-term CR funding wouldn't be needed. House passed all 12 bills, Senate Dems blocked all 12 bills. Enough IS enough! https://t.co/NjiKPzAmeEWorking w/ NJ colleagues @RepLanceNJ7 &amp; @RepJoshG to ensure taxpayers can deduct entire 2018 property tax prepayments from 2017 income tax returns.

There is bipartisan support on committee to do so. Timing unsure. Frank https://t.co/j5dJ0DiAmKCongressional investigations into Russian interference continue now but not indefinitely.

Will continue to work with my colleagues to prevent drilling off our coast. https://t.co/WRUUEVurPgAs I believe most #SouthJersey residents &amp; Americans do, I prefer to let ongoing investigations into Russian interference be completed &amp; findings issued, not prematurely create conclusions based on limited publicly released info or personal political agendas. Frank https://t.co/E450mCq6m9Working w/ entire New Jersey Congressional delegation - Dem &amp; GOP - in opposition to @Interior proposed drilling plan. As Florida is now apparently removed, so should all of the Atlantic. Coastal communities across New Jersey are opposed with good reason - simply not worth risk.As I strongly opposed when Obama Admin tried to open Mid-Atlantic to drilling, I strongly oppose Trump Admin plan for same. New Jersey coastline supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, $45B tourism industry, recreational/commercial fishing operations &amp; marine habitatsTo move forward w/ oil &amp; gas drilling in Atlantic, @Interior should hear directly from #SouthJersey residents what significant costs entail for minimal (if any) benefits. In consultation w/ @CMCChamber, requested public hearing in Cape May County by @BOEM_DOI prior to final plan https://t.co/xCdMGec5BWBipartisan Efforts underway Bob.

Shutting down gov is never a good option.While improvements made to retain deductions for medical &amp; educational expenses, the $10k collective cap on state/ local income tax &amp; property tax deductions will be detrimental in my high-tax state of New Jersey. I will be voting NO as it is in best interest of #SouthJersey.When #taxreform debate began, I made clear what I could &amp; could not support in a final bill. Hard-working #SouthJersey residents already face excessive taxes from Trenton, thus preserving key deductions at federal level would be critical to garner my support.When it‚Äôs the right policy, I support it...regardless of who sponsors it.

Looking forward to speaking w/ innovative high school/college students @Stockton_edu #StockHack event &amp; change of command @177thFW ceremony.Hard-working residents already face excessive taxes from Trenton, cannot compound burden by eliminating state/local income tax, capping property tax deductions &amp; removing those for med/ed expenses. While support reforming/simplifying tax code, NO vote = best for #SouthJerseyWhen #TaxReform legislation introduced, said my support was dependent on preserving key deductions critical to taxpayers in my high-tax state of New Jersey. Regrettably this bill did not meet that standard.By responding on social media &amp; staff confirming my NO vote to #SouthJersey callers to set record straight. Plenty of #FakeNews peddled by special interest groups, applaud those who question. Appreciate your tweet. Frank https://t.co/gy1DKcpc8kVital issue for many &amp; another reason IÔ∏è am a NO today.
