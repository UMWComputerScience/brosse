Read more here: https://t.co/5h3HZnEQfp https://t.co/4ywSsZhv2rI've long pointed to the success of groups like @PAFarmBureau who provided health insurance to nearly half its farmers through an AHP prior to Obamacare. I applaud @USDOL for expanding access to AHPs &amp; providing relief to American workers/job creators ➡️ https://t.co/jdqAMyDI1kA former #SmallBusiness owner, I know that one of the greatest concerns for small employers is providing affordable health care to their employees. AHPs put small businesses on a more level playing field w/ larger organizations, letting them negotiate lower health care costs. https://t.co/Ac23tSdO1mHad a productive listening session this morning that brought stakeholders together to discuss putting mitigation incentives into place so communities are not overly burdened when building back after a disaster hits due to an increased federal cost share of disaster assistance. https://t.co/tdGoJemTZaLast week, the House passed my bill to help fight the #OpioidCrisis, and by the end of this week, the House will have considered more than 50 pieces of legislation to protect our communities from the scourge of opioids. https://t.co/xVN8Kg3n0i6 months into #TaxReform and 95% of manufacturers have a positive outlook for their companies - a record high in the past 20 yrs. https://t.co/KUAot6QEE9A former #SmallBusiness owner &amp; mayor, I understand the key to job creation/unlocking economic prosperity in local communities is investment in small, private businesses. I'm proud to have voted for the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct which created the #OpportunityZones development program.If you make a long-term investment in one of these #OpportunityZones, you defer your capital gains tax for up to 10 yrs, which gives investors an incentive to help rebuild our communities.In April I urged @stevenmnuchin1 to consider the importance of opportunity zones to the people of PA. Last week @USTreasury designated 300 PA zones including Berwick, Bloomsburg, Shamokin, Sunbury, Danville, Hazleton, Hazle Township, Carlisle, &amp; Harrisburg https://t.co/l56uf4twnoCongratulations to the @UDA_Schools Trojans on their first state softball championship in school history! https://t.co/njXdntlmYGA falling unemployment rate + faster wage growth = a big leap in economic confidence among lower-income Americans #TaxReform https://t.co/Jh20NWkLHz#KidsBeforeCongress https://t.co/Q4BgXsIDQrNot a day goes by where I don't think of my father, Rocky.

He's right and it will take a comprehensive, bipartisan approach to find real-world solutions to help those impacted by this horrible epidemic #CrisisNextDoor https://t.co/FvJtoKX97mMore than 115 Americans die every day from the misuse of opioids. That's one person every 12 minutes. Last year in PA over 5,000 died from overdoses. The opioid epidemic is the #CrisisNextDoor and we must find bipartisan, real-world solutions to address it https://t.co/m7EMuBYctkToday I was proud to vote to provide the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs with $85.3 billion - the highest level of funding in history for our veterans. https://t.co/jJTKZP6PE4...We have more jobs than unemployed workers, wages that have continued to rise, and consumer confidence is at a 17-year high. Oh, and don't forget about those "crumbs." This is the kind of economy Americans have been waiting for. https://t.co/myg4au9MKh9 yrs ago Trooper Joshua Miller of the PA State Police died in the line of duty saving a child who'd been abducted by his father.

His response: ⬇️ https://t.co/qW20dI5dc6Pleased to announce that PA will receive $35+ million in federal infrastructure grant funding! This will help create jobs and enhance our national freight network which will generate opportunities for economic growth across the Commonwealth https://t.co/ZIhNn6UmOWIt's unacceptable that our teachers and students go to school each day hoping nothing happens to them. Prioritizing their safety should not be a difficult decision for Washington. #KidsBeforeCongress https://t.co/wo2D5U2itDMay was a great month for American families! 223,000 new jobs added and an unemployment rate that hit an 18-year low #JobsReport https://t.co/cFQqsgF5n7Congrats to all of the students from the five central PA sports teams who joined @realDonaldTrump and @IvankaTrump yesterday for the White House's Sports and Fitness Day! https://t.co/3p97THew9e https://t.co/kWhKgkkX9tThe people of Bloomsburg have suffered enough, and I’m pleased to say that the funding awarded today will help protect 100+ homes, the Bloomsburg Middle School and High School, businesses, and a fire station https://t.co/22uFDXOoOc 3/3In 2011 I saw Tropical Storm Lee ruin lives here - destroying homes and putting employers out of business - and brought then Speaker of the House @SpeakerBoehner to see firsthand the need for the flood wall.

We are providing much needed relief for the people of Pennsylvania and standing up for Main Street 3/3In PA alone, Dodd-Frank has closed the doors of 500 bank branches. By mandating burdensome &amp; costly regulations that suffocated community banks, credit unions &amp; small businesses, some in Washington put Wall Street over Main Street at the expense of the American people 2/3Due to Dodd-Frank, big banks have gotten bigger while Pennsylvanians have suffered. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo &amp; Bank of America hold 32% of all deposits, up from 20% in 2007. Last year, 45% of all new checking accounts were opened at 1 of these big banks 1/3 https://t.co/i4Ih43sNsVI'm proud to have voted today to give our troops the biggest pay raise they've seen in 9 years. The most basic responsibility of the federal government is to protect our nation and citizens.

And no parent in America should worry about their children, if they’re going to come home safely when they send them to school. #KidsBeforeCongressThere are armed guards, guard dogs, and metal detectors to keep Congress safe. But today, children across America will go to school and be sitting ducks in a classroom #KidsBeforeCongressIf Congress can find a way to increase security for ourselves so quickly after our lives are threatened, then we can do the same for students. Why should the lives of those in Congress be more important than the lives of any parent’s child in America? https://t.co/UP7s1Px4BPBy passing S. 2155, we are taking authority out of the hands of unelected Washington bureaucrats, tearing down overly burdensome regulations, and giving the people of PA the tools they need to achieve the American dream https://t.co/9yhmOXZ111Proud to have voted for #TaxReform which keeps piling up those crumbs for hardworking Pennsylvanians! https://t.co/JmrcGtASzjToday I pressed @BetsyDeVosED on efforts to secure our schools and the importance of afterschool programs like @shine123_abc.

I will keep working w DHS/POTUS to strengthen critical infrastructure protections &amp; give students the safe learning environment they deserve - free of fear &amp; violence 3/3Our children are our greatest asset, and schools are critical infrastructure. There are 16 sectors of critical infrastructure so why do these senseless tragedies mostly happen at schools? What good is this classification if these horrific attacks keep taking innocent lives? 2/3As the father of 4 daughters, 2 of which are teachers, and the grandfather of 8 children, let me be clear - No student/teacher should go to school in fear. No parent should send their child to school with the possibility of never seeing them again. We can and MUST do better. 1/3My heart breaks for the students, teachers, and staff of Santa Fe High School and for the families who lost a loved one in this morning’s tragic attack. We must secure our schools.As a former mayor, I've seen firsthand what officers risk to keep us safe. That's why I've always fought for legislation that better protects and supports all of the brave men and women who wear the uniform #NationalPoliceWeek https://t.co/LDAXIoak1R https://t.co/W5tV4qYVbzYet another reason why my colleagues in the Senate must act on my bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act.

No sweat, right guys? 🇺🇸 https://t.co/tfoFUuYCPeBy reducing chain migration to just immediate family members we will help to reclaim the integrity of America's immigration law!You're right! Immediate family members should be allowed to stay together (spouse and children). However, extended family immigration must be scaled back to create a better immigration system working for American citizens AND legal immigrants. 

It will benefit everyone! https://t.co/zbN1LENtgTImmigration should be based on merit, right?

They refused to even bring up an amendment by @SenToomey on the #SanctuaryCities that put American citizens at risk. 

Do they want to fix the problem or do they support illegal immigration?Senate Democrats continue to show their contempt for the rule of law by blocking @SenToomey amendment on #SanctuaryCities 

The law makes this nation possible!This is a shame. Sanctuary cities put American citizens and legal immigrants at the back of the line, behind illegal immigrants.

Let's not destroy the foundations of our legal immigration system during #DACA discussions by moving them to the back. 

The interest of American citizens come first.#DACA must be addressed with sufficient security fixes to deter illegal immigration. Foreign nationals should be under no illusion that the United States will fail to enforce immigration law. 

National security and security for American workers are the top priority."to adorn, and preserve it. The picture was made for the apple—not the apple for the picture.”“The assertion of that principle, at that time, was the word, ‘fitly spoken’ which has proved an ‘apple of gold’ to us.

A well run legal immigration system can accomplish both of these goals, but there cannot be an immigration law w/o the distinction of illegal v legal. A “good” system would deter illegal immigration.To uphold the integrity of the legal immigration system, American citizens must have confidence the government has a handle on illegal immigration. 

Republicans have been willing to address #DACA, but without enforcement corrections, we’ll be in the same mess 5 years later.Americans are seeing the tide of opportunity rise. The large #TaxCuts and rollback of Washington First regulations has swelled the economy with energy. Wage growth is up, unemployment is down, and opportunity abounds. 

We want to do more, but more effort from across the aisle!We are revitilizing the American dream day after day.

America will grow

America will prosper

We want to find a #DACA solution, but why would we vote on something that doesn't fix the underlying illegal immigration problem? https://t.co/Ue1xQE6bL2Anyone have an answer on this 👇🏼? https://t.co/dkMXmHJoZuThank you @SenToomey! https://t.co/MCLrRVzyb2Are Nancy Pelosi Democrats for or against illegal immigration? 

Very simple question that needs an answer before any #DACA solution is reached.Why are American citizens and legal immigrants always put at the back of the line by the Nancy Pelosi Democrats? 

We are at the table to find a #DACA solution, but "demanding" from the American people the "right" to citizenship is a perversion of the law and the Constitution.Grassley-Graham memo on Christopher Steele possibly misleading the FBI on discredited #Dossier. https://t.co/NkFdRCCfMfI wonder what the context is of this text from Lisa Page.
