Working across party lines, this bill will modernize and improve the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act. https://t.co/pTWydBMjnO https://t.co/ihtSvTtf1nTax reform results continue. #Winning https://t.co/udCrNigGhEAs we celebrate School Choice Week, it's important to remember the critical roles public, private, charter, and home schools play in preparing the next generations. @schoolchoicewk https://t.co/Y4GeuVrwBvI am relieved that this senseless government shutdown is coming to a close. Democrats in the House and Senate manufactured this crisis to force Congress to grant amnesty to people who are not legally in our country. https://t.co/DEKtlE7yjgResolving DACA now, is not a crisis; funding the government and our military is. https://t.co/tInfTuPGR9Senate, it's time to end the #SchumerShutdown. Now. https://t.co/SItLVmb4MGWhat an injustice to those immigrants who stood in line to become legal American citizens, that Democrats would shut down our government over those who are here illegally - and don't even want to have to get in line. #ShumerShutdownIt's time to end the #schumershutdown https://t.co/H7GgZ3aLg495% of Democrats in Congress voted FOR a government shutdown - 94% of Republicans in Congress voted against it.  #SchumerShutdownRecord DOW, historic tax cuts, booming economy, American optimism high – These things are why Democrats have resorted to the #SchumerShutdownThe #SchumerShutdown is a desperate attempt to distract from a booming economy and a year of historic accomplishments.House Democrats tried to block your Representatives from seeing the FISA memo – Senate Democrats have blocked funding the military and children’s health care #obstruction #SchumerShutdown #ReleaseTheMemoDonald Trump doesn’t have a vote in Congress; Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats do. Dems own the #SchumerShutdown161,000 of Georgia’s children - about to lose health care coverage amidst a devastating flu epidemic. Senate Democrats must pass the CR - to fund Children’s health care (CHIP), the military, and the government. #SchumerShutdownRecord DOW, historic tax cuts, booming economy, American optimism high – These things are why Democrats have resorted to the #SchumerShutdownThe #SchumerShutdown is a desperate attempt to distract from a booming economy and a year of historic accomplishments.House CR funds health insurance for over 9 million American children, but the Dems have blocked it because there’s no Amnesty for 690K illegal immigrants. #SchumerShutdown95% of Democrats in Congress voted FOR a government shutdown - 94% of Republicans in Congress voted against it.  #SchumerShutdownIt’s hard to imagine there aren’t nine Democrats who will vote for the longest reauthorization of SCHIP ever (6 years). #SchumerShutdownThe Democrats support every item in the CR, but they are blocking a bill they actually support to play party politics with American lives. #SchumerShutdownPunishing American service men and women, and blocking insurance for American children, is no way to fix DACA. #SchumerShutdownHouse Democrats tried to block your Representatives from seeing the FISA memo – Senate Democrats have blocked funding the military and children’s health care #obstruction #SchumerShutdown #ReleaseTheMemoHouse Dems are trying to block a measure to allow an immediate vote on any funding bill the Senate passes. Dem obstruction could add three additional days to the shutdown.It’s time for Democrats to put policy ahead of politics and end the #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/yILchK5wkUDonald Trump doesn’t have a vote in Congress; Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats do. Dems own the #SchumerShutdownUnderstanding the #SchumerShutdown is simple. Democrats are using American citizens as pawns to try to give amnesty to some who are here illegally.Budget package bills require sixty votes to pass in the Senate. The GOP has 51 Senators. Are there not at least nine Dems who will choose to stand with our Military men and women? #SchumerShutdownThe Democrats continue to play politics with American lives. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/1LSmGGLpieSenator Schumer knows it takes 60 votes to pass a budget. I think now would be a good time to change that rule. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/xZ1w7EZcaLI will be on the noon @wsbtv newscast discussing the #SchumerShutdown. Democrats are choosing political games over children and our military.I read the FISA memo, and I believe the American people should too. I have made a formal request for it to be released immediately.  #ReleaseTheMemo https://t.co/bRFGdDE1TgThank you to Jill Stanek and Melissa Ohden with @SBAList for standing for life! #whywemarch...We have taken so many steps to protect life, and we will not stop until every life is ensured those certain inalienable rights: LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness...Love Saves Lives.

Why won’t you vote to fund our military and support our children? #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/qPmcSnMKNi@SenSchumer Why are Democrats punishing 9 million children for something we have more time to work on? #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/qPmcSnMKNiWhat leads to a government shutdown is you stalling over an artificial deadline, @SenSchumer. The American people deserve better. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/V4yPfvsljP@SenSchumer, we don't need a shutdown. Instead, vote to authorize CHIP for 6 years to provide millions of children with the lifesaving health care they deserve. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/qPmcSnMKNiYou know what keeps us from a shutdown, @SenSchumer? Voting to support our troops rather than playing political games. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/qPmcSnMKNiDemocrats are playing political games - voting against health care for children and for shutting down the federal government. https://t.co/rwwUiqTK4p https://t.co/B0J9i00KUGMy bipartisan bill that passed the @FinancialCmte today amends the law to require that financial regulatory agencies get rid of duplicative, outdated, or irrelevant regulations when conducting their periodic reviews. https://t.co/pTWydBMjnOThree families from different areas of the U.S. with different income levels - guess what? They all keep more of their hard-earned money under the new tax plan. https://t.co/XRchZySzfwWith the goal of eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle innovation and competition, HR 4607 is a bipartisan step in the right direction.This bill requires regulators to tailor regulations that they find to be outdated, duplicative, unnecessary, or overly burdensome instead of only producing a report.HR 4607 broadens the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 to other financial regulatory agencies to make it more effective and gives them the opportunity to tailor regulations rather than painting them with a broad brush.@FinancialCmte Working across party lines, this bill will modernize, expand, and improve EGRPRA.HR 4607 will ensure regulators do more than just 'check the box' when it comes to finding and reporting duplicative and damaging regulations. @FinancialCmteI introduced H.R. 4607- the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act with @RepJoshG  (D-NJ) and @RepSeanDuffy (R-WI): a bipartisan improvement of EGRPRA.Watch LIVE as we debate my bipartisan bill, HR 4607 in the @FinancialCmte : https://t.co/4qivZgkyoGWe are working in the @FinancialCmte for small businesses and community banks.

https://t.co/M1OqAUAKAMHow do we avoid a government shutdown? 
It’s quite simple, the Senate needs to dig out the House spending bill, which appears to have been stuffed in a drawer somewhere, dust it off, and pass it before the current CR expires. https://t.co/zY62prHb61Prayers for my friend and colleague. https://t.co/qHxA0ybnBd...In 2017, the House passed many bills to help fight human trafficking, but we all must remain vigilant and steadfast in our pursuit to end this abhorrent practice.

They are attacks against our freedoms, our values, and our way of life.Today’s attack in New York is more evidence of the continuing threat every American faces from terrorists and radical Islamists.Wish I could be in Texas to cheer on the @kennesawstfb Owls tonight in the FCS playoffs, but we're cheering for them back home! #Throwback #GoKSUOwls https://t.co/kgkfp4Y27UA ‘warming shelter’ will be opened today Friday, Dec 8 at the Beavers Drive Senior Center at Hamilton Park at 1:00 pm in Bartow County.
