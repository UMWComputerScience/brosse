https://t.co/knu8YtV2fkThe House will consider several immigration bills this week that address this issue, and I urge the swift passage of legislation that solves this issue once and for all.This development further highlights the urgent need to pass immigration reform that strengthens border security, transitions to a merit-based immigration system and puts an end to this awful policy.Except in cases of suspected abuse, I do not support separating children and their parents at the border. This practice, which originated in prior administrations but has recently surged, has gone on too long.PASSED: The #STOPact will help close security holes in our international mail system that are allowing poisonous synthetic opioids to flow into our communities.

While opioid legislation is important, the work of people like @tkelce and others on the front lines is a vital part of raising awareness &amp; making changes that last.
https://t.co/BGzCMogvG7Good read by James Gillespie about the services provided to veterans at Comitis Crisis Center. We have a responsibility to care for those who have served our country, that is why I have cosponsored H.R. 4099 to help homeless veterans &amp; their families.

Our door is always open!Also, @SSCJoCoKs, I live in Topeka. Home every week.  I've had extensive conversations with relevant legislators on state tax policy.Our tax reform plan will lower tax rates for families/businesses, simplify the tax code &amp; make U.S. more competitive in global marketplaces.Instead of paying the highest taxes of any first-world country, pass-through businesses will be in line with our other global competitors.In what world does 0% equal the same as 25%??? We are taking the rate down from 39.6% to 25% - not 0%.This article is comparing apples to oranges... Federal and State tax reform are not the same. https://t.co/bYXjX4ZbDEGreat to see you're back home, @SenatorDole!! https://t.co/lLIXbz8faXWhile I support the 2nd Amendment, I believe we should close the regulatory loophole that allows bump stocks and other devices like it. https://t.co/9KqRhYvh72I agree. https://t.co/bMakWB2OJfBest of luck to @govsambrownback on his confirmation hearing today.
