Debbie and I were thrilled to be in Annapolis for the Commissioning Ceremony of our niece, Tatum Phillips! We are so proud of you Tatum. https://t.co/XBBNUcNmV9Honored to meet with CDT Sarah Morrow, West Point nominee from #NC11! She's outstanding--Western NC is well represented. https://t.co/LIYuXmPpBTThanks especially to my colleagues who spoke on the House floor in support of the resolution: @CongressmanHice @RepTomGarrett @RepLeeZeldin @WarrenDavidson @RepAndyBiggsAZ @RepGosar @replouiegohmert and othersThis resolution with @Jim_Jordan just PASSED the House floor. Outstanding news. Many thanks to my colleagues for their support.

This is a loud and clear message from Congress: it's time for the DOJ to be forthcoming and tell the truth to the American public. https://t.co/ibFPljrglgIf Rod Rosenstein and the Department of Justice have nothing to hide, they certainly haven't acted like it.

Turn over the documents, Mr. Rosenstein. Show Congress and the American people the truth. https://t.co/TXe6o6yQZpHAPPENING NOW: The House is voting on H. Res. 970, a resolution from myself and @Jim_Jordan to formally compel the DOJ to turn over all remaining documents within 7 days.

We are tired of the DOJ giving us the runaround. It's time for Congress to vote and hold them accountable.The importance of the new SCOTUS vacancy cannot be overstated. President Trump now has another opportunity to appoint an originalist Justice to the Court--one who will respect the rule of law and not legislate from the bench.

This is massive.The Supreme Court's Janus decision this morning is absolutely critical. Public sector employees shouldn't be forced to subsidize political opinions they disagree with. That's a textbook First Amendment protection.

This decision guards their free speech rights. Great news.My constituents want to know: what exactly did Strzok, lead Clinton and Trump campaign investigator, mean when he said "we'll stop" Trump from becoming President?

Peter Strzok has a lot to answer for. https://t.co/ilLWpGabz7Why are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer refusing to support narrow, standalone GOP bills to reunite families at the border? 

Are they really interested in solving this problem? Or just the politics of blaming President Trump?

https://t.co/mvhDfOM5JQThe DOJ continues to insist they've complied with document requests when they blatantly have not. This letter is an art form in creative writing. https://t.co/Ktf5qvzLdAThe DOJ and FBI have been given a choice: be part of the 'clean up' team, or be a part of the 'cover up' team.

Based on their decisions so far, their intentions are clear: to continue the obstruction. If so, the House should vote to compel them to hand over the documents. https://t.co/TNp9lBrD50New reports of DOJ/FBI compliance with document requests are NOT accurate. While they have turned over additional documents, the new documents represent a small percentage of what they owe.

The notion that DOJ/FBI have been forthcoming with Congress is false.There is a growing body of evidence that the FBI made edits and changes to 302's, or summaries of witness interviews, in both the Clinton case and the early Russia investigation.

This is incredibly troubling and needs to be examined. I appreciate the IG looking into it. https://t.co/rXI7IzDNdaCharles was a brilliant thinker and an outstanding communicator--but far more importantly, a man of unwavering character and integrity who treated everyone with respect. We will miss him.

Praying for the Krauthammer family. https://t.co/r7EnXIwvDzAmericans demanded immigration reform in the last election. Their mandate was clear: secure the border, build a wall, stop sanctuary cities, and make our laws smarter.

Why shouldn't Congress keep working until the people's agenda is done? That's our job. There are no excuses.My Democrat colleagues' insistence on Presidents solving problems with a "pen and a phone" is troubling.

How about Congress actually do its job and legislate? https://t.co/7NZmwstwsTI introduced a clean bill today to allow immigrant families to stay together at the border. H.R. 6143. Why is Chuck Schumer preemptively opposing solutions like this? 

Could it be because he’d rather talk about President Trump and politics than actually solve the problem? https://t.co/Ma3lF5KVGKBetter (very) late than never https://t.co/bdnBZOWh0R.@Jim_Jordan lays it out clearly: Peter Strzok, the guy who ran the Clinton investigation and led the investigation into the Trump campaign, hated Donald Trump. His bias showed up all over the IG report.

How was this allowed? How does Peter Strzok still have a job at the FBI? https://t.co/B9JveEszjMI just introduced a bill that will allow families to stay together at the border, closing some of the loopholes in our asylum laws. Read more on the bill here -- https://t.co/BRGSO7qnBV https://t.co/Z0YaCiSt9gThe power went out, but the work doesn't stop for the Western NC Fish and Wildlife Conservation Council. Thanks to them for having me join them in Rosman on Saturday! https://t.co/26bK9Ys44kSo saddened to hear this--Dr. Belcher was a dear friend and a leader of impeccable character, beloved by the entire Western Carolina community. Prayers for the  Belcher family. His influence is one we will all miss dearly. #BelovedBelcher https://t.co/aVmWld3S4MBeing a dad to Blake and Haley, and a grandad to Autumn, has been my greatest blessing. Happy Father's Day to all the wonderful dads out there! https://t.co/Nsfd753ngaThere are glaring examples of bias all over this. Right here, page 421, the report says Strzok was so biased that the IG "did not have confidence" Strzok's handling of the Weiner laptop (at the end of the Clinton investigation) was "free from bias." That's a big deal. https://t.co/SEdY7bfIWJThe notion that the IG "found no bias" at the FBI/DOJ is wrong and a serious misreading of the findings. Read the report. IG found Peter Strzok's conduct to be so biased, he called it "antithetical to the core values of the FBI and DOJ." 

That is blistering language in IG speak.If Director Wray truly believes there isn't a serious problem of bias at the FBI, after today's news, then he clearly hasn't read the report. 

This press conference underscores that he is not taking this as seriously as the American people. https://t.co/eMazpkOsLoThis section of the IG report (420-421) is remarkable. It calls the Strzok/Page texts "not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects"

Wow. https://t.co/5z9IIcCXbuI've initially reviewed the IG report--two questions are most pressing:

1) Why is Peter Strzok still employed? 
2) Why has Rod Rosenstein repeatedly failed to promptly inform Congress of improper conduct?Lisa Page text to Peter Strzok: “(Trump’s) not ever going to become president, right? Right?!”

Strzok reply: “No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.”

This Peter Strzok text about "stopping" Donald Trump was hidden from Congressional investigators. We never had it. Absolutely unreal.Happy birthday, Mr. President! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/X67RISzvULIt is completely inappropriate for Rod Rosenstein to threaten staffers from a committee in this way--this report is unbelievable. He needs to be held accountable. 

I stand with our committee staff, and I hope our leadership will too.
https://t.co/kiZN0tU9YWThe resolution would require the DOJ to turn over the documents within 7 days of passage.

We are calling on our leadership to put this to a vote immediately. Enough of the talk. It's time for Congress to start taking votes and force the DOJ to face accountability.NEWS: @Jim_Jordan and I just introduced a resolution to compel the Department of Justice to turn over ALL remaining documents to Congress related to the FBI's initial "collusion" investigation into the Trump campaign and the handling of the Secretary Clinton email case https://t.co/6eNpF2lARYWonderful news https://t.co/AjXzT0M5IjProud to support my friend @ChuckGrassley’s amendment to keep the farm safety net for real farmers and prevent payments from going to non-farmers and Wall Street.

It will require special counsels to undergo a semiannual audit from the GAO on their expenses.

This is a big win for taxpayers--special counsels shouldn't be able to avoid accountability on where they spend Americans' money. https://t.co/kI86lVjkANAwful to hear this news from @krauthammer -- a brilliant thinker with a voice that inspired so many over the years. And yet, even in sharing his sad news, he conducted himself as he always did: with class, grace, and integrity.

We are praying for him and his family. https://t.co/8rXFEqYNw6I've introduced an amendment to require a semi-annual financial audit of special counsels by the GAO.

A special counsel's work is important, but they should not be able to spend taxpayer dollars without accountability.

Congrats to the @POTUS @realDonaldTrump admin on a tremendous first #500days! Looking forward to continuing the fight in the coming days, months, and years.Former FBI assistant director for intelligence (who served under Mueller) agrees: the FBI's conduct in using a "CHS" (a secret informant) with the Trump campaign raises red flags.

https://t.co/gxeMCBaew6Amazing. This is what the DOJ frequently uses redactions for. 

Not for national security reasons, as they claim, but to save themselves from personal embarrassment--or, even worse, to hide relevant facts. We've caught them doing it several times now.

https://t.co/rYTGWykKE7It is time for Americans to hear the truth about what happened at the Department of Justice on their taxpayer dime. It is time for a second special counsel.

https://t.co/dOj6o273nwRod Rosenstein knows exactly what happened and what is in the documents requested by Congress. Either the matter warranted investigation long ago and he did nothing, or he's seen the facts and believes nothing is wrong.

Be sure to visit D.C. this summer. https://t.co/sjScFKvc6zThis is the right call from @realDonaldTrump--we've seen disturbing evidence that the FBI engaged in political targeting. 

But the DOJ can't be trusted to investigate themselves--Congress needs the documents too. Rod Rosenstein: where are the documents?

https://t.co/sGRAsXjLfNGina Haspel is a brilliant leader, a dedicated public servant, and someone uniquely qualified for the job of CIA Director. I fully support her nomination and I'm confident my Senate colleagues will find her to be absolutely unmatched.Last week Chairman @DevinNunes sent a subpoena to the DOJ with a deadline of Thursday. Once again, the DOJ ignored the request and will not comply.

Same story--more obstruction. Enough is enough. It's time to hold DOJ officials in contempt of Congress.The latest report from House Intel proves the point: the DOJ/FBI have been using redactions to protect their own reputation, under the guise of "security concerns." This is wrong--period. Americans deserve the truth, regardless of whether it makes the DOJ and FBI look bad.The concerning inconsistencies in James Comey's story continue to add up. 

The latest: Director Comey told Congress that FBI agents saw 'no physical indications of deception' in Michael Flynn. Then, when asked about it in the media, Comey repeatedly denied that very same claim. https://t.co/sDDo4aUTHdThank you #NC11 Veterans, and Veterans across the country, for your service to America.

Congressional term limits would do wonders toward addressing the problem. 

I'm 100% on board Mr. President. Let's make it happen. https://t.co/GVwptJo3fMThe Iran Deal was and has always been a foreign policy debacle. But today’s stunning intel presentation from @netanyahu provides even more troubling context. All along it was built on a crumbling foundation of lies, deception, and naivete.

https://t.co/4OL6fP4ClGWe wrote this in an op-ed yesterday. All the evidence points in one direction: Comey and Clapper set up a briefing with President-elect Trump to legitimize the dossier and give the media the "news hook" it needed to report the unfounded allegations
https://t.co/yy85zNqydFJames Comey and James Clapper insist they had nothing to do with the media reporting of the Russian dossier.

It sure looks like that isn't true. Read this remarkable section from the Intel report. Clapper discussed the dossier with journalists and lied to the committee about it. https://t.co/sEAOkahJUTFrom day one, the ‘Russian collusion’ investigation into the Trump campaign was an empty case. It is a house built on sand.

It's time for the special counsel to wrap this investigation up and bring it to a close. https://t.co/zI1xWAxK6R https://t.co/uZKQ7Y3Ic6The Intel Committee Report is out--the committee found "no evidence" of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

There's "no evidence" because it didn't happen--the "collusion" case was empty from day 1. It is time for Mueller to end this.
https://t.co/oTrjNpazmtYesterday James Comey told @BretBaier he had shared his memos with not one, but three people. He had never disclosed this to Congress.

Director Comey has a few more questions he needs to answer. ICYMI: my op-ed from yesterday. 

https://t.co/yy85zNqydFDirector Comey also claimed to not know for a fact whether the dossier was funded by the Democrats and Hillary Clinton (it was--it is a fact), and then he immediately pivoted to the well-debunked claim that Republicans funded the dossier. Odd.It's difficult to know where to begin on that Director Comey interview w/ @BretBaier. He just admitted to leaking his memos (with now-classified info) to two more people, in addition his friend.

So he shared government property with not one, but three people? What?Spot on from @Jim_Jordan. Why did Director Comey fail to disclose that he had secretly hired his friend--as a "special government employee"--just before leaking government documents to him?

And I would guess--this isn't the only time Comey used friends to leak government info. https://t.co/BPEygomFtiQuestion 5: Did Comey give his memo(s) to anyone else? https://t.co/wgL3tDFxUiQuestion 4: Why did Comey fail to mention he had secretly hired his friend, law professor Daniel Richman, as a “special employee” of the FBI?

(Professor Richman is the same friend Comey leaked government documents to) https://t.co/oE5T2iaGi4Question 3: Did Comey and James Clapper coordinate to give the Russian dossier credibility and leak its contents to the media?

The timeline suggests they held the dossier briefing with the President-elect for the purpose of giving the media what they wanted — a “news hook” https://t.co/ZlymBDl0nHQuestion 2: Why did Comey leave out pertinent facts when he briefed then-President-elect Trump on the Russian dossier?

He told President-elect Trump nothing of Christopher Steele's credibility issues or of the dossier's origin as a Democrat paid-for campaign document https://t.co/a6LqboJSrJQuestion 1: Did Comey and his FBI improperly coordinate with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice during the height of the Clinton email investigation?

He denied any coordination under oath. Evidence suggests this is not true. https://t.co/AWkKdF5mQfIt sure looks like James Comey misled Congress and the American people--at times under oath. Here are 5 questions Director Comey needs to answer. My op-ed--
https://t.co/yy85zNqydFMy friend Jim Bridenstine is as principled, thoughtful, and dedicated as anyone you'll find. An excellent choice by President Trump who will serve our country well at @NASA. 
https://t.co/Z70mJbeT1lIf anything, this impugns the judgement of Director Comey. He's the one apparently using the media to exaggerate concerns about interactions with the President. He's the one leaking government (and possibly classified) documents to a third party. Come on.These Comey memos were supposed to implicate President Trump? Really? 

On page 13 POTUS appears to instruct Director Comey to investigate and find the truth about whether his campaign team did anything wrong. There's nothing in here even approaching 'obstruction of justice.'Rod Rosenstein prosecuting Andrew McCabe would be asking the Department of Justice to penalize the Department of Justice. This is a textbook conflict of interest. This should be grounds for a special counsel.28 CFR 600.1 is the statute titled: "Grounds for appointing a Special Counsel":

1. Investigation/prosecution of US Attorney’s office would present a conflict of interest for the Department (of Justice) (https://t.co/IiBEvRZrsp)Andrew McCabe lied to his FBI superiors not once. Not twice. Not three times. He lied four times--multiple times under oath.

The criminal referral from the IG is the right decision. It's about time we have some accountability for this type of conduct at the Justice Department.The IRS failed to effectively implement the President's directive to ease the financial burden of Obamacare, and it's placing some taxpayers in a crisis. 

Americans shouldn't be forced to carry a financial burden because the IRS fails to get its act together--period. https://t.co/wfBvUS1IgMHappy birthday to a great friend and one of the most principled men I know, @justinamash! It's an honor to serve with you.More here: "Documents show 'concerning level of coordination' between FBI, DOJ in Clinton email probe"

https://t.co/5Rwb4QWrILHere's the question that needs to be answered: Did Director Comey, while under oath, mislead Congress and the American people on whether he coordinated with Loretta Lynch and the DOJ during the investigation of Secretary Clinton?

Some evidence suggests the answer is yes--he didI sent the below letter to @GOPoversight Chairman @TGowdySC, regarding multiple troubling inconsistencies in the comments and testimony of James Comey https://t.co/nui1VOgh61She left behind a legacy of grace, dignity, and class--and the entire country will miss her for it. Prayers for the Bush family tonight. https://t.co/WiaPDBBUqHI'm thinking of our brave American soldiers tonight--the men and women who represent the very best of America's spirit. 

To our service members: we are with you and praying earnestly for you and your families. Thank you.The path forward should be clear: it's time for an independent, third party investigator to look at the facts, pursue the evidence, and present what happened. AG Sessions should nominate a special counsel to find the truth for the American public.But it’s important to remember the big picture: McCabe was a critical figure in both the Clinton email investigation and the "Russian collusion" investigation. These revelations on McCabe raise serious concerns about the decisions of FBI and DOJ leadership in both 2016 and 2017.This initial report from Inspector General Horowitz confirms that the firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe wasn’t just defensible—it was absolutely warranted."We make this so hard in Congress. Let's just do what we told the voters we would do."

https://t.co/g7fdu6laae.@Jim_Jordan is right. It's no wonder Americans are cynical about Congress when we vote on a "balanced budget amendment," only a month after passing a $1.3T omnibus bill.

Republicans had better get serious about using the rest of 2018 to do what the voters elected us to do. https://t.co/lcIvyuaz6YThe level of improper payments that our government authorizes is staggering. @GOPoversight is holding a hearing today to outline how we can fix it. https://t.co/MqOkqjl7CZI truly believe there is no better choice for Secretary of State than my friend Mike Pompeo--one of the most thoughtful individuals I've had the chance to work with in Congress. 

He would serve our country well. I'm confident my Senate colleagues will see that today.While I appreciate Mr. Lausch's efforts, the Inspector General for the DOJ has all of the relevant documents. Why not turn over those documents to Congress? Let us do our job.

The DOJ been of little to no help to Congress in this investigation.It's taken the DOJ over 5 months to produce only a few thousand documents to Congress--yet as of today, they still can’t tell us how many documents they owe, when they'll deliver them, and what their redaction standards are. 

Again--it's been over 5 months..@Jim_Jordan and I are tired of the excuses from the Department of Justice. Enough is enough. 

Give us the documents this week, stop the obstruction, and be transparent with the American public--or there will be consequences. https://t.co/dJ6snOf1piDebbie and I are very sad to hear of the passing of Reynolds VFD Fire Chief, Richard Sales.

That should raise red flags--and at minimum, it's worth looking into.These texts seem to show FBI officials were briefing the Obama WH on the early stages of the Trump campaign investigation in 2016. How much did the Obama WH know? Were they involved?

Bright young people with a phenomenal group of teachers. https://t.co/XK8c5k4wYZWestern NC continues to be well represented in the nation's business community. Great to meet the team today at the Marion, NC location of Coats--one of the global leaders and suppliers of industrial thread and consumer textile crafts business. https://t.co/kBSOf6ubwHAt what point does all this troubling info become enough? We can appoint a special counsel for a nonsense collusion case (with zero evidence), but we can't do the same for a DOJ that, by now, appears clear-as-day politicized?

It's past time. We need a second special counsel.To be clear: these are two high level FBI agents who appear to be discussing/laughing about the FBI Director potentially getting involved in the 2016 election--just days after the "Russia investigation" into the Trump campaign had begun. 

The timeline here is concerning.July 28, 2016: Text from Lisa Page to Peter Strzok, citing this article (https://t.co/DHYlHa4ehm): “Ha. First line made me smile”

The first line of that article? --“Potentially unpleasant news for Jim Comey: We need you to intervene in the 2016 election again” https://t.co/tHNQGDsdgMNew July 2016 texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page show a troubling reference to former FBI Director James Comey potentially intervening in the 2016 electionGreat to see the team from Etowah Horse Shoe Fire Department today--training on a Saturday to keep our community safe. 

Thanks to them for their faithful service. https://t.co/zkSyDmNaNsThank you to the Delta Kappa Gamma Teaching Sorority for hosting me this morning. More importantly, thank you for the incredible work you do investing in our students! https://t.co/677cnUXRl8The @freedomcaucus would fully support you in this move, Mr. President. Let's pass a short term CR while you negotiate a better deal for the forgotten men and women of America. https://t.co/Dj05V8hevlPresident Trump could not have made a better choice for National Security Advisor than @AmbJohnBolton. He is excellent and will serve our country well.@RepGoodlatte @TGowdySC @Jim_Jordan @RepRatcliffe @RepKenBuck Full text of Chairman Goodlatte's letter https://t.co/dhqCBv0QKBNEWS: After DOJ's inadequate response to a request from @RepGoodlatte, @TGowdySC, @Jim_Jordan, @RepRatcliffe, @RepKenBuck, and myself--

The Judiciary/Oversight committees have issued a subpoena for documents related to FISA abuse, the Clinton investigation, and the McCabe firingI voted 'no' on the Omnibus, because this spending bill doesn’t just forget the promises we made to the voters—it flatly rejects them.

This is not the limited government conservatism that our voters demand. https://t.co/EYikeGUx3uMembers of the @freedomcaucus sent the below letter to the WH:

"Mr. President, we urge you to remember the countless forgotten men and women of America who placed their faith in you to change  business as usual in Washington, D.C. We urge you to join us and reject this omnibus." https://t.co/eO0B1PfCYl- Record spending levels
- No wall/border security
- Obamacare intact
- Funds Planned Parenthood
- Sanctuary Cities funded
- Barely 24 hours to read a 2,300 page bill

This Omnibus is so far from what the forgotten men and women of America voted for. I will oppose it.Congress is about to vote on a $1.6 trillion funding bill, privately written by congressional leaders (still yet to be made public)--giving members and the public around 24 hours to read its 2,000 pages.

This is the total opposite of what Americans voted for. When will we learn?Great meeting at the White House today with @POTUS on the topic of addressing "sanctuary cities." 

I agree with the President: local governments that defy federal immigration law shouldn't see one dime of taxpayer funded grants. It's time we #DefundSanctuaryCities https://t.co/YzHkKEFKpdThanks to Matt Witt and the students of the Henderson County Early College Civics + Economics class for having me video-chat into their class today. Great discussion! https://t.co/QUTwY8FC9cAs the omnibus vote approaches this week, please read this op-ed from @SenTedCruz, @SenMikeLee, @Jim_Jordan, and myself.

It would be unacceptable to bail out Obamacare with billions in new spending. Republicans should reject this proposal.

https://t.co/sVckjnJjsTAndrew McCabe was an incredibly central figure to multiple investigations leading up to the 2016 elections.

His firing confirms the need of what many of us have been calling for for months: we need second special counsel. It's time.Here's the bottom line: the DOJ/FBI must operate with greater transparency and turn over more documents with fewer redactions, allowing Congress to investigate and do our jobs. That's what the American people demand.Important story. When a lead FBI investigator (Peter Strzok) discusses his personal relationship with a FISA judge, the DOJ should not keep that kind of material from Congress, and more importantly, from the American people. We need to know. Period.

Case closed. It's time we return focus to the people's agenda.Why should Congress continue pouring taxpayer dollars into cities that defy federal immigration law? That shouldn't happen in America--a nation of law and order.

@POTUS is right--Congress can withhold federal grants in the upcoming omnibus. It's time to #DefundSanctuaryCities. https://t.co/B7DRlsFsWNAmericans spoke loudly and clearly in the 2016 election: they are fed up with our government encouraging a disregard for the law.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump is absolutely right ➡️ Congress must DEFUND "sanctuary cities" in the upcoming omnibus spending bill. Let's get it done.North Carolina Dairy Farmers are some of the hardest working people I know. Met with many of them in Asheville earlier. Wonderful people, great conversation. https://t.co/hLv1LTh1dp#FollowFriday ➡️ @RepAndyBiggsAZ, @RepMikeJohnson, @RepRalphNorman, @RepTedBudd, @RepTomGarrett, @RepMattGaetz -- Great conservatives committed to changing Washington and putting their constituents firstTaking away the #SecondAmendment rights of law-abiding Americans is NOT the answer--but that doesn't mean we should all run to our corners and avoid trying to find solutions.

The exemption for Canada and Mexico is a welcomed decision by President Trump and highlights meaningful discussions to protect American interests.I love what this young man @KyleKashuv is doing--engaging on all sides of the aisle to discuss ideas and solutions (like @TheReachOutApp), all while understanding that we all have the same ultimate goal.

This is how problems get solved. We need more like you in D.C., Kyle. https://t.co/kNmfVHMTPDThis bill is the direct result of the input and leadership of law enforcement professionals like Henderson County @SheriffCSM, @NCSheriffs100 President Carson Smith, and Sheriffs all across Western North Carolina.

The time to act is now. Let's invest in our children's safety.5 years ago, the first bill I introduced in Congress was a bill to strengthen funding for school security.

Every week it seems to become more clear: FBI leaders have not been upfront with us about this entire investigation.

https://t.co/U071Jza658The idea that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia was always ridiculous. It remains so now. We've spent more than a year investigating this and we've seen zero evidence of any collusion.

This young man is a hero https://t.co/vTSpn3Ib71We would all be far better off if we would focus the conversation on targeting foreign influence in American elections, rather than obsessing over a "Russian collusion" narrative that is based nowhere in realityYou can dance around an issue all you want, but the bottom line is this: it never hurts to do what you told the voters you said you would do when you asked for their vote during election seasonSo many times in Congress, we take a simple reality and make it complicated. 

Reality: We told the voters we would put America first, secure the border, and end programs like Diversity Visa Lottery that worsen the immigration problem. Why won't we actually fight to do that?If the House is going to wait for 60 Senators to figure out an immigration bill first, we might as well all go home and take a nap.

Ji Seong-ho--once starved and tortured by the North Korean regime--now free. Remember his story. https://t.co/6TxNxxrP0CRepublicans did not pay for the dossier. The dossier was not created until Democrats took over the Fusion GPS contract. That talking point has been debunked many times now.

Also, "salacious and unverified" are not my words. They are Director James Comey's words. https://t.co/BSWDwVJG13I want the American people to see the Democrat memo. I believe they will. But this has to go through a process and sourcing methodology has to be fixed, just like it was with the original memo.The FBI and DOJ not only used a "salacious and unverified" political dossier to spy on political opponents, they failed to be upfront with the FISA Court about where that dossier came from. That's unacceptable. Period.Remember what we know: the DNC and Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier. The FBI and DOJ then took that "salacious and unverified" document and used it to get a secret warrant from a secret court to spy on Americans, in the context of a political campaign.Democrats keep complaining about their counter-memo not being released. But if it was so critical, why have 75% of House Dems not even read their own memo? 

Perhaps even they know: this memo was written in panic as a misdirection from the disturbing information we already know.Remember: We've won many conservative victories, just within the last year. Taxes are lower. Needless regulations being slashed in record numbers. Constitutionally conservative judges are being confirmed to the courts.

We lost the spending battle. But we will see better days. https://t.co/JhRqy7IR1pAfter this week, it would be the easiest thing in the world for limited government conservatives to disengage. I share your disappointment.

We have to do better. https://t.co/4iRr46W4tY https://t.co/PtqPbzim3FI promised my constituents in Western NC that I would work to cut government spending. This budget deal does the opposite--it expands government spending well beyond the caps, by almost 15%.

We have to do better. Future generations depend on it. https://t.co/feewY0NoYD✅ Checks out! Always enjoy talking to @ChrisCuomo. Thanks for having me today. https://t.co/BkRw6JyAasMore good news! This "Armageddon" thing isn't so bad https://t.co/rml9h76mvTI want to pass a long term budget and give our military financial security.

But bottom line: my constituents didn't send me to Washington to grow the size of government by 13%. That's not what we told the voters we would do. https://t.co/3rirfCVUXMRecall that one of the common criticisms from the left was that the middle class tax cuts "expire" after 2025.

I look forward to working with my Democrat colleagues to make sure American workers and families know: their lower taxes are here for good. https://t.co/nqD9ZTwqveAmericans deserve the certainty of knowing that the individual tax cuts are here to stay.

So, let's make the lower tax rates permanent. Led by @RodneyDavis we've introduced a bill to do that. Read our op-ed here --&gt;
https://t.co/KsOH5anbSjThe minority tried to block the GOP Intel memo from the public over "national security concerns" that proved to be untrue. This is the right response from my Republican colleagues--unanimously supporting transparency. 

I've read the Democrat memo. Americans should see it, too. https://t.co/KdhgdQruc0Really enjoyed seeing a great friend of mine in DC last week--North Carolina House Speaker, Tim Moore! @NCHouseSpeaker https://t.co/jusAEepWhqThinking of the @TomColeOK04 team today, especially Sean Murphy's family--very sad news. My prayers are with them. https://t.co/xLg8lCsuU2On babysitting duty today with my granddaughter, Autumn. Grateful. https://t.co/xEoU132ZYvWell, if you're trying to push back on the idea that the Department of Justice was weaponized politically, this is certainly not how you do that. The only "winner" should be Lady Justice... not individuals hinting at a vendetta. https://t.co/8mAfLNqVxJIt's happening https://t.co/Tz4Uq4L4rJ100%. My Democrat colleagues say we don't have the full picture. Ok, then let's move toward releasing all of the information! Tell Americans the full story.... the FISA application, all of it. https://t.co/NZW9pp8rw3Wow. Bruce Ohr, a DOJ official, was receiving oppo research from his wife, Nellie Ohr, who was working for Fusion GPS. Bruce Ohr was taking DNC/Clinton paid-for oppo research and giving it to the FBI.

That relationship was NOT disclosed to the FISC. How? How does that happen? https://t.co/J7GhZZL0wGHere it is. The FBI took an unverified political dossier and used it to get a secret warrant to spy on an American citizen and political opponents. 

And they *didn't* tell the FISA judge that the DNC and Clinton campaign had paid for that dossier. 
https://t.co/qgOKd8lJd5On every level, this conduct from intelligence officials at the FBI and DOJ is completely unacceptable. Period.

We need answers. We need them now.The creator of the dossier, Christopher Steele, even told DOJ official Bruce Ohr that he (Steele) was "desperate that Donald Trump not get elected president"--and yet NONE of that information was shared with the FISA judge, and the dossier was still used.Not only that—senior FBI and DOJ officials knew about the Fusion GPS dossier's political origins and connections to Democrats, and they EXCLUDED that information from their FISA application. They didn't tell a judge that their information was unverified political oppo research.So, there it is. The FBI took an unverified political dossier, paid for by the Clinton campaign and the DNC, and they used it as a central piece in their request to get a warrant for spying on American citizens and political opponents in the Trump campaign.As the positive #TaxReform news continues to roll in, it's important to remember the key principle in play here:

Americans do far more for the economy, job creation, and wage growth than government ever will.More incredible news! @thermofisher, a company with a huge #NC11 presence, is investing $50 million in response to the new tax cuts--including a bonus of $500 for each of the company's 68,000 eligible non-executive employees.

https://t.co/F9h5NTnTnQOutstanding. America is on the comeback trail! https://t.co/nNchBonYBmLast point: If you remember anything from this news cycle, remember: your right as an American to privacy from your government spying on you is critical. It is foundational to who we are as a Republic. Never take that right for granted, no matter the political party you belong toIf any Department of Justice, Republican or Democrat, put their thumb on the scale for the sake of politics--it would undermine the very fabric of who we are as a nation. Americans deserve the truth, one way or the other.I know we live in a hyper-partisan environment, and I know it can be easy to disregard any inquiry like this as party politics. I understand that.

But this is so far above politics, folks. Lady Justice wears a blindfold. Her scale is supposed to be balanced.So the bottom line is this: if, in 2016, the DOJ and FBI used an unverified, Clinton/DNC paid-for dossier to spy on American citizens (and political opponents) in the Trump campaign, that is as wrong as it gets.

If that happened, Americans deserve to know about it. Period.We've asked repeatedly for information from the FBI, both privately and publicly. We've openly told FBI and DOJ officials--if we're wrong, tell us! Tell us what was in the FISA application. Let us see the document. But we've been stonewalled for almost a year.Now, from what we've already known for months, it sure looks like that's exactly what happened: that the FBI used that very dossier to get a warrant. @Jim_Jordan asked the FBI about it 2 months ago. I asked too. We asked for the FISA application, and the FBI wouldn't show us.Quite simply: This infamous "Russian Dossier" was unverified political opposition research paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC. If the Department of Justice used information like that as a key part of getting a surveillance warrant, it would be a HUGE problemNow, pause: we know about the Peter Strzok/Lisa Page texts, the "missing" texts, the McCabe concerns, etc. But this is about more. Focus on the dossier here--the political opposition research project put together by Christopher Steele, Fusion GPS, and the DNC by extension.So, take that principle, and look at what happened in this case. The DOJ spied on Carter Page, an American citizen. Red flag. Carter Page was also part of the Trump campaign. Double red flag. It should automatically raise questions.Remember, in general, the DOJ and FBI spying on American citizens should automatically be met with MAJOR skepticism. That's what the Fourth Amendment is designed to protect against. When those American citizens are ALSO political opponents? It should raise even more red flags.What this issue is all about: whether the Department of Justice and FBI, under President Obama, abused their surveillance authority against American citizens and political opponents. Put another way: was the Obama DOJ weaponized to spy on the Trump campaign?THREAD: Because through all the "memo" news and headlines, it's critical to remember why this issue is important and why it should matter to everyday AmericansSo, to review: the first problem with the memo was "material omission of facts"--and now they want names redacted? 

Why not just give Americans the facts? Be fully transparent with them. Let them be the judge. https://t.co/u3MAcyM7kPThis onslaught of "crumbs" is getting way out of hand https://t.co/XqMV9t2QedSo the FBI is worried about omissions? Ok then--let's put all the documents out there. Tell Americans the full story. 

I don't think they want that either, though--they've been stonewalling Congress for a year. It's time for full transparency. #ReleaseTheMemo https://t.co/lXZjS09UcROne other personal note: my staff, Debbie, and I have all received dozens of concerned messages on this today from colleagues, reporters, or friends.

Just terrible--please pray for them and their families.The powerful image of a young man, lifting his crutches in defiance of a North Korean regime that once tortured him. I will never forget this moment. 

God bless you, Ji Seong-ho. https://t.co/DSuUz8qCvRI've read the counter-memo from Intel Dems. It contains several factual errors and sourcing issues--when these are fixed, I believe the memo should be made public to all Americans.

But let's be clear: nothing in this memo suggests ANY factual inaccuracies in the original memo.Abuse of surveillance powers should not be a partisan concern--it undermines the very spirit of who we are as a nation. If that happened at the FBI and DOJ, Americans deserve to know.

Applause to Chairman Nunes for his leadership on making this info public.This was true before tonight's vote in the Senate. It's still true now. 

Every life is precious. Every life is a gift. https://t.co/tBbFy5cHHJBREAKING: The House Intel Committee voted to release the classified memo related to FISA and surveillance abuses. It now goes to the President. Outstanding work from Chairman Nunes.

We're one step closer to the public rightfully seeing the very same memo we did. #ReleaseTheMemoAmericans make better decisions with their money than government does--the latest chapter https://t.co/59osOvzKtERemember their lives. Honor their legacies. 

#HolocaustRemembranceDay #WeRemember https://t.co/GnFL8kiAxrThe American people deserve to see the very same disturbing House Intel memo that I've seen. It's time to make the memo public.

Take my poll and add your voice if you agree --&gt; https://t.co/YZGQFGmCO0 #ReleaseTheMemo https://t.co/QFNL6mLTewThis is the former deputy head of counter-intelligence at the FBI (and lead Hillary investigator), appearing to be discussing the need to go easy in the Clinton investigation.

Wow. https://t.co/VF6zQpFPjxI was a small business guy for 30 years. Let me tell you: $1,000 would have gone a long way for me. I know it would (and will) for most Americans, too.

These aren't "crumbs," Leader Pelosi. These are real benefits for real Americans, keeping more of THEIR hard-earned money. https://t.co/FUkhfTbfTu🤔 https://t.co/yNx0TGveFvWow--these are benefits going straight to the workers who deserve it. Tremendous news. https://t.co/yFIpmCT0TXI support #SchoolChoice, because where a child lives should not determine whether they have access to a high-quality education. Parents and families--not government bureaucrats--should be able to decide. #SchoolChoiceWeek https://t.co/kK8Wz6WYULCongratulations to a dear friend and colleague on this fantastic news! You are missed on the House side @SenDuckworth https://t.co/f0mQjyQwlzBottom line: tell us the truth. Tell us the truth about what happened with the Clinton investigation, the 2016 election, and leading up to this "collusion" investigation. All of it. Americans deserve the truth.This is not party politics. This is not partisan bickering. This is an issue that gets at the very heart of who we are as a nation. If any officials at the FBI were engaged in this kind of behavior, we need to know.And remember, this doesn't even address a host of other questions! The dossier. The Carter Page FISA application (that they still won't show us). The 5 months of mysteriously "missing" Page/Strzok texts. The FBI communicating with Fusion GPS/DNC-hired Christopher Steele. Come on.Folks, this stinks to high heaven. If this is anything what it looks like--the FBI changing course on investigation, putting their thumb on the scale to undermine Donald Trump and essentially help Hillary Clinton--that is as wrong as it gets. This demands further investigation.
