Because of their efforts, our office has closed more than 700 veteran claims with the VA, helping our heroes get the help and benefits they deserve. #NC06 https://t.co/npfukC0VSnHonored to bring the VA and 30+ organizations that serve our veterans to Greensboro to help our heroes.

Today, he was awarded The Soldier's Medal by the Sec. of the @USArmy for his heroism. Thank you Brad for your valor and leadership. https://t.co/OJXvqySZDlFor too long, federal bureaucrats at unaccountable agencies in the Swamp have been protected from dismissal or punishment for ignoring their jobs, not showing up to work, or failing to serve Americans. That is why we are passing laws to hold them accountable. #NC06 https://t.co/RLnjq0p8zlThere are currently 139 executive, 57 district court, &amp; 10 circuit court nominations pending. The Senate needs to stop useless obstruction so we can continue our success in energizing the economy &amp; keeping our promises. Thanks @SenatorLankford for pushing for needed rule changes.We‚Äôre proud of you and the difference you are making, Portia! https://t.co/XZIppvbnxfGreat to be part of this awesome welcome team as we greeted students coming from @GCSchoolsNC‚Äôs Peeler Elementary to Bluford Elementary.

Thank you Vice President Pence and @POTUS for your support. #NC06 https://t.co/M4qF9TUxvJPraying for the @SDJFNC team. Their organization is all about hope and providing refuge for those in need of a safe place. We'll make sure they get back on their feet so they can keep working to fight  domestic violence. https://t.co/dMTj55xpETA privilege to bring @VP Mike Pence to see the way our community is coming together to recover after Sunday‚Äôs storm. #NC06. #GreensboroStrong https://t.co/cCpyJSIcHSThe devistation to our neighborhoods, churches, and schools is powerful. Yet what is stronger is seeing people in our community work hard and lend a helping hand to their neighbors. Today was a moving display of the strength of our community. #NC06 https://t.co/JBnRaPqJmzI was blessed to spend some time visiting the people, schools and churches impacted by the recent storm in Greensboro and Rockingham County. Here are some of the the individuals I met and the reasons I am so positive on the future ‚Üí https://t.co/vGUfx8aecI #NC06 https://t.co/Js1oW88HWpRep. Walker fights to bring American pastor home from Turkey https://t.co/ImJUHBzN1J@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight Looking forward to discussing NC Pastor Andrew Brunson being unjustly held in a Turkish prison and our call for his release.Run for almost a decade by Commissioners who spent more time misleading Congress and attempting to bury scandals than they did serving Americans, the #IRS has operated under a different set of rules than what they expect from taxpayers. #DittoAct https://t.co/wjFzMw2NWYFor what it‚Äôs worth Mr. West, Congress is good at spending one and wasting the other. https://t.co/JJPT4Am1TxYesterday, on #TaxDay, I introduced the #DittoAct to force accountability on the #IRS and ensure that they are working under the same rules as the people and businesses of North Carolina. https://t.co/wjFzMw2NWY"The program, which has been in existence for three years, was created as an avenue to specifically open up career pathways for North Carolina-based HBCU students in the realm of politics."

This Black Millennial Is Breaking Racial Barriers On Capitol Hill https://t.co/WXReez1NeHThank you @POTUS for speaking up for North Carolina‚Äôs Pastor Andrew Brunson. Turkey should drop the false and ginned up charges against Pastor Brunson immediately and release him to be with his family. https://t.co/coAWfGthVL"Some people give time, some money, some their skills and connections, some literally give their life's blood. But everyone has something to give.‚Äù Thank you Barbara Bush for all the joy, love, and wisdom you gave to our nation. Prayers for the Bush family.Once again, @SenateMajLdr is making excuses for why he cannot do what we all promised in the past. This rejection of @POTUS‚Äôs spending cuts shows that he prioritizes his backroom deal with liberals over conservatives‚Äô promise to rein in government excess. https://t.co/8DU1t4FDVuYou had one job. #TaxDay https://t.co/rCZx3c79fpYesterday, I spoke with @NC_Governor about the recovery efforts. We both are amazed to see all the organizations, churches and officials come together to make sure we do our part in taking care of our community. Thank you to all of those serving neighbors and making a difference. https://t.co/0n7URs2se1Our team will be at @MTZBC1 and in damaged communities again today helping serve displaced students and those impacted by the storm. If you know of anyone in need of food or supplies, please send them to 1301 Alamance Church Road or give our office a call at 336-333-5005.(3/3) Turkey should drop the false charges against Pastor Brunson immediately and release him to be with his family.

We will not relinquish our efforts or our voices in calling for Pastor Brunson‚Äôs freedom.(2/3) We should expect Turkish government's commitment to the rule of law and tolerance for religious minorities to be as clear and consistent as Pastor Brunson's denial of the charges.(1/3) @TurkishEmbassy ‚Äôs ginned up charges against Pastor Andrew Brunson of Black Mountain, North Carolina, are an embarrassment to the Turkish people and Turkish Government.

As a @NATO ally, we should expect more from #Turkey2.7m American children have an incarcerated parent. Non-violent drug offenses account for roughly 50% of the federal prison population. Taxpayers spend more than $70b each year to incarcerate 1 in 100 American adults. Now‚Äôs the time to act on #CJReform.

Portia was our April #NC06 Community Hero of the Month. https://t.co/3WH0163YfXIf further action is needed, I look forward to the President and the Pentagon seeking input and authorization from Congress. My prayers are with the men and women of our Armed Forces as they serve as a global force for good.This isolated and targeted action by the President shows that the United States will not allow violations of international law, disregard for innocent life and basic humanity.Bashar al-Assad is a murderous oppressor who has kept power through barbaric acts and the poisoning of women and children, empowered by futile words from the West and the crutch of evil regimes in Iran and Russia.Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Daniel Markus. Daniel was always kind, cheerful, and professional in a challenging job. Condolences and prayers to the @myfox8 team and the Markus family as they celebrate Daniel‚Äôs life.üá∫üá∏ can again export pork to üá¶üá∑.

As Dr. King taught us, the time is always right to do what is right. #CJReform https://t.co/syMwEn23X9Great joining @WFMY's @julie_luck and @ChadSilber last evening to discuss our success in getting Congress to vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment and Vice President Pence's trip to North Carolina next week. #BBA #NC06 https://t.co/TZgYiFlsQpJust landed at @flyfrompti. Will be joining @WFMY in studio tonight. See you at 11pm @julie_luck and @ChadSilber. #NC06 https://t.co/VUv7cjl28pThat vote - along with the unfortunate outcome today - highlights DC‚Äôs lack of willpower and courage to focus on future generations, rather than future ballots. I will remain committed to ensuring that the federal government lives within it‚Äôs means, just like every family in NC.Last year, I secured this important vote and kept my promise, before knowing that this Congress would go on to inscribe reckless trillion dollar deficits into law with rushed spending bills. #BBAPart of the reason I ran for Congress was frustration with Washington‚Äôs inability to spend responsibly and show fiscal leadership. That is why I made a pledge to the people of North Carolina to push for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. #BBA https://t.co/oydUcWWxmgThanks to #TaxReform, manufacturers‚Äô optimism is at historic levels. This is big for NC as manufacturing represents more than 1/5 of our state‚Äôs total output and employs more than 10% of our people.

Check out these numbers from the @ShopFloorNAM Outlook Survey: https://t.co/cnVxxNHQpCToday #WeRemember the 75th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the 6 million men, women, and children murdered during the Holocaust just because they were Jews. Never again can we allow such an affront to humanity. All life is invaluable. #HolocaustRemembranceDay https://t.co/2AYKsR4sX5Even if the #BBA fails to receive the supermajority support it needs to be sent to the states for ratification, holding a vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment will show the public where their representatives stand on the issue of reining in government. https://t.co/JIghzGshNNWe‚Äôre proud of you, Vashti. Excited to watch your career grow.

‚ÄúI had many people telling me that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to ever get a job here and it would be impossible because I wanted to wear my hair natural, I went to an #HBCU, and I am a black woman.‚Äù https://t.co/lCCnNzCrwKWith government‚Äôs education approach for the last five decades falling well below even the most reasonable expectations, it‚Äôs time to choose a better path. That‚Äôs why I introduced the #APLUS Act ‚Üí https://t.co/yobbZxdNZ7 #NAEPThis report is not an indictment on the teachers who work passionately to serve our students, but ultimately highlights the failures of bureaucratic mandates and one-size-fits-all policies that prioritize meeting arbitrary standards rather than what is best for each student #NAEPThe release of the 2017 #NAEP ‚ÄòNation‚Äôs Report Card‚Äô shows the stark reality that we are failing to prepare our children to live prosperous lives and ultimately pushing the American Dream out of reach. We need to pass the #APLUS Act. 
https://t.co/yobbZxdNZ7No Zuckerberg here, but we are doing important work at @GOPoversight, hearing testimony on we can help our communities combat the #OpioidEpidemic.

We need to keep working to fulfill our promises and rein in Washington‚Äôs spending, balance our budgets, provide second chances through #cjreform, and restore the hope and opportunity of the American Dream. https://t.co/bZ7ebl9HiaWe must remain diligent with the present working on the impending concerns of reining in Washington‚Äôs spending, balancing our budgets, providing second chances through criminal justice reform, and working to restore the hope and opportunity of the American Dream. #BBA #cjreformPaul‚Äôs character and integrity is respected among all members. With that said, he is still Speaker through January and we have plenty of work to do.The tides of Washington come and go, but family is forever. It is with this in mind that Speaker Ryan has decided to not seek re-election and invest the same time and energy he put into representing Wisconsin into his family. https://t.co/vfUtJ5Gl9kWe need to take a hard look at government's approach for the last five decades and recognize that it is falling well below even the most reasonable expectations. Reforms like my #APLUS Act would fix our broken top-down approach and empower teachers and parents, not bureaucrats. https://t.co/lUa9pu1I1GWe are very proud of Vashti! #AggiesDo #NCAT https://t.co/gZBj1gRNdkThankful for the kind words of Mr. Dunn of Sanford: ‚ÄúLee County [is] a top priority for him‚Ä¶[Walker is] a staunch supporter of life, upward mobility, strong conservative values, and has taken positions on more than one occasion against party leadership.‚Äù "https://t.co/1c4fHxeN5jBy closing the resources traffickers use and by providing law enforcement w/ resources to find &amp; prosecute them ‚Äì like my Human Trafficking Detection Act signed into law by Pres. Obama did ‚Äì we can help end these atrocities and promote our principle that all life is invaluable.Tonight, the House will pass the End Banking for Human Traffickers Act to combat money laundering related to human trafficking.Tomorrow, President Trump will sign legislation I co-sponsored, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (FOSTA) to bring perpetrators of trafficking to justice.This will be another great week for our work to fight the abhorrent crime of human trafficking in North Carolina and across the United States. #NC06 #EndTrafficking  https://t.co/xDikfwhz2pGreat visiting R.H.
