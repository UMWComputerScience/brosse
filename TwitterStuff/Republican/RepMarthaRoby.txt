Looking forward to today’s announcement - good luck! https://t.co/Z4LoE2TY48Yesterday I visited Madix, Inc. for a tour of their facility. Among many other items, Madix manufactures product shelving, so when you visit the grocery store &amp; take an item off the shelf, there's a chance Madix made it. I'm glad Eclectic Mayor Davenport joined me for the visit! https://t.co/EqoPVsIB1lI was glad to catch up w/ my AL-02 Agriculture Advisory Council during a call today as we look towards passing the new #FarmBill in the next few weeks.

I was thrilled to “fly” it myself &amp; to join the GKN employees in seeing firsthand what they work so hard towards. Many thanks to Lockheed Martin for making this possible. https://t.co/j7QbOd0x94What an exciting afternoon! I enjoyed lunch w/ GKN Aerospace employees in Tallassee where I had the opportunity to visit one-on-one w/ them. These hardworking individuals perform vital work on the UH-60 at Sikorsky &amp; the F-35 soon to be flown by the 187th Fighter Wing. https://t.co/TjdPmLFX6PIt’s been confirmed that a C-130 military cargo plane crashed outside of
Savannah, Georgia, and two deaths have been reported. As we continue to learn
more details, I will be praying for the families impacted by this heartbreaking
tragedy. https://t.co/SAgf0Gl5jXGreat news for Alabama! The Public Service Commission announced that @alabamapower customers will see lower bills over the next 2 years due to the tax overhaul.

Enjoyed it. https://t.co/zoopbq4PPQAt this morning’s event, I was humbled to receive the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Spirit of Enterprise award for my pro-business voting record. I count it a privilege to work on behalf of the business community to advance policies that unleash the private sector &amp; foster growth. https://t.co/98AMq82GS6What a great morning! I started the day surrounded by longtime friends at the @MGMChamber Eggs and Issues breakfast. I was honored to have the opportunity to address the group, and I touched on some of the many noteworthy accomplishments we’ve had in the House this Congress. https://t.co/dJKvVZQTOJI just finished a great lunch meeting with the Dothan Kiwanis Club! We discussed a number of important topics, including progress on the new farm bill and efforts by Congress and the Trump Administration to secure our southern border. Thank you for hosting me! https://t.co/mtySFx8o2lI enjoyed visiting the Wiregrass Museum of Art today! It was especially great to talk w/ students from Grandview Elementary School who were at the museum for an art class. I was truly impressed by all the exciting developments at the museum - thanks for having me! https://t.co/K72oHKI0xQGreat news for the Wiregrass!

AG Sessions &amp; I agree: This is unacceptable. https://t.co/OkQMG0v8UhI am proud to be unapologetically pro-life, and I strongly believe that our online platforms must be neutral public forms that will allow us to continue to speak out for the unborn.It is appalling to see that the very unborn children who cannot yet speak for themselves have an advocate like @MarshaBlackburn fighting for them – only to be erased by others.As I said in the @HouseJudiciary hearing, our First Amendment rights should be upheld whether we are speaking words in an open forum, writing words in a book, or typing words online.Today during our @HouseJudiciary hearing, my friend @MarshaBlackburn shared her personal experience w/ online censorship. On one occasion, an online platform removed her pro-life message about fighting the sale of baby body parts because the company deemed it "inflammatory." https://t.co/noSFiqcdm1There are reports that some city &amp; state govts are passing laws to blacklist federal contractors, some from AL, because they wish to work on behalf of the federal govt to bolster the infrastructure at our southern border &amp; more. AG Sessions &amp; I agree: We will NOT accept this. https://t.co/hSbzuU5AS1Madina Qasimi, Former Chief of Staff to the First Lady of Afghanistan, came by my office today to brief me on Afghan women’s recent achievements as well as some of the challenges they continue to face each day.

I’m proud that the new #FarmBill reflects our conservative principles.The new #FarmBill maintains vital nutrition assistance for our most vulnerable Americans when they truly need it while making a commitment to helping them improve their circumstances.As I told @wsfa12news, this farm bill also includes some important welfare reforms that implement strict work requirements &amp; close categorical eligibility loopholes.ICYMI: Last week I visited the Montgomery Lions Club for their weekly meeting. I was glad to offer an update from DC, including the great news that @HouseAgNews has approved the new farm bill. This is positive news for the farmers in our state &amp; AL02. Next stop --&gt; House floor. https://t.co/iYrlP8Z4nGAs you may know, yesterday a tornado passed through southeast Alabama. @Ft_Rucker sustained some damage, but thankfully no injuries have been reported as of now and operations continued normally today.

Thanks for meeting with me! https://t.co/DoCEIRg5MPThis #TaxDay marks the last time you'll have to file taxes using our old, complicated tax code. Our historic tax reform makes filing simple &amp; nearly doubles the standard deduction. Next year Americans will finally file taxes using a system that works for them - not against them. https://t.co/a9pwhUfTDQThere's been a lot of misinformation spread about the Omnibus that the President recently signed into law, &amp; I want to make sure you have the facts. The Omnibus does NOT fund abortion. It DOES include the Hyde Amendment, establishing that taxpayer $ cannot be used for abortions. https://t.co/xR5O6QSZCVTomorrow is Tax Day, but this year there's a silver lining! This will be the last time Americans have to file taxes on the decades-old, confusing system. Next year, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most Americans will see lower taxes and a much simpler process. https://t.co/zcdQUB5X9mMy top priority for the new farm bill is that it is in the best interest of the farmers I represent and that our Alabama commodities are treated fairly.

In AL02, agriculture is the largest employer, responsible for more than 93,000 jobs and $11 billion in economic impact. I know how important it is that Congress gets this right on behalf of our farmers. https://t.co/YHO0VShEAqThe Assad regime’s brutal chemical attacks against innocent people must not be tolerated. I support the Administration’s targeted action. https://t.co/fvCdxP4xUQEach Congress since being elected to serve AL02, I’ve introduced legislation similar to H.J. Res. 2 that unfortunately failed to pass the House yesterday. I hope we'll soon see it across the finish line to ensure that future generations aren’t burdened by insurmountable debt. https://t.co/FzPVsbCExsH.J. Res. 2 is a commonsense measure to require our federal govt to spend less than it takes in. Hardworking Americans balance their budgets. It’s past time for the federal govt to be required to balance the budget &amp; it’s sad that House Democrats refused to support this measure. https://t.co/a4hHKNYWWlThis afternoon I had the privilege of meeting Cameron Pierce &amp; Kevin To of Prattville.

The families of fallen heroes should never be denied the funds they need because of a government shutdown.During the 2013 government shutdown, the families of more than a dozen U.S. servicemembers who were killed in action were initially denied military death benefits.
