The largest obstacle to greater participation is the high cost. This bill will create a grant opportunity for pharmacies and other proper venues to offer this service, and safely dispose of the unused opioid pills.Drug Takeback Day has been a useful tool as we seek to curb the growing epidemic of prescription opioid abuse. Having excess and unused medicine lying around is a recipe for danger. These pills need to be safely and properly disposed of so they won’t be misused, stolen or sold.This week, I introduced H.R. 5628, the Access to Increased Drug Disposal (AIDD) Act of 2018 along with @RepTomMarino, @davidcicilline, and @RepPaulTonko. This bill aims to increase participation in the DEA's Drug Takeback Day. 
https://t.co/iZJ9rmzNBaWe're live with @EPAScottPruitt in @HouseCommerce. Click the link to tune in. https://t.co/pZTEEFHUWOThe people of West Virginia’s First District didn’t hire me to just represent one party in Congress. They wanted someone who would work across the aisle to achieve results on the issues that impact them, and that is how I have sought to lead. 
https://t.co/BW543PDxSyThis is exactly why we fought to reauthorize and expand the Brownfields Program. Cleaning up abandoned eyesores and re-purposing them for new use can completely revitalize a community and spur additional economic developmentThis large Brownfields grant will be a game-changer for Weirton. Receiving this revolving loan fund grant will enable the city to partner with other organizations to turn a significant number of abandoned industrial sites into economic opportunity.The EPA announced today that Weirton will be receiving an $800,000 Revolving Loan Fund Grant as part of the Brownfields Program. Our office sponsored the reauthorization and expansion of the Brownfields Program that was signed into law earlier this year.
https://t.co/fswKpv5LvWIt’s an honor to be recognized for our efforts, and we look forward to continue working for the First District in a bipartisan manner.Our office has worked with members from both parties to find solutions to combat the opioid epidemic, expand access to healthcare, spur job creation and economic development, ensure our veterans receive the care they deserve, and protect our seniors.The people of West Virginia’s First District didn’t hire me to just represent one party in Congress. They wanted someone who would work across the aisle to achieve results on the issues that impact them, and that is how I have sought to lead.The Lugar Center, a non-partisan policy organization focused on bringing both parties together to find bipartisan solutions, recently named me the 16th most bipartisan Member of the House of Representatives for 2017.

https://t.co/gXnRMK4coJ@POTUS has kept his promise to end the war on coal.

"In 2017, US coal exports increased by 60% to 97 million tonnes, with a double or triple digit growth to every continent, according to data published by the US Energy Information Administration."
https://t.co/MFkYc0QAIq"He brought up a power plant in Pleasants County, https://t.co/nXf7S8He9s., as an example of the fallout if something isn’t done.""McKinley suggested that the federal grid watchdog was not adequately addressing the economic impact its action, or inaction, has had on coal states."
https://t.co/Xda3E2VRyAAbandoned sites are an eyesore to the community and are detrimental to economic development. The Brownfields Program has been an important tool to turn these abandoned eyesores into economic opportunity.Great coverage on our successful effort to reauthorize the Brownfields Program, 
https://t.co/M42p18wBX6Great having @AWOAdvocacy in the office this afternoon to give us an update on their legislative priorities. https://t.co/XwifQPMd6M"If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities." - Barbara BushToday, we all mourn the passing of Barbara Bush, and are keeping the entire Bush family in our prayers. As First Lady, Mrs. Bush was a tireless advocate for family literacy, and she was an inspiration to us all. https://t.co/gdgtoaGW7O@POTUS has approved our delegation’s request to declare the flooding in West Virginia a major disaster. This will bring additional federal resources to bear to help those affected recover from the devastating storms. https://t.co/aFpAo9wp23Great having the West Virginia State Building Trades Council in the office today to discuss their legislative priorities for the year. https://t.co/Qe96IDFdzXI think we have a moral responsibility to look at this thing holistically, rather than just an ideological fight against what we think is a free market.
https://t.co/Xda3E3dsXaThe good news keeps coming in! Kroger, who has a large number of stores in WV, announced that because of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct , they're raising their tuition reimbursement benefit X5, and raising their 401K retirement match from 4% to 5%.

https://t.co/fvgXMVORDbAnother great article covering our grilling of Mark Zuckerberg over the illegal sale of opioid pills on Facebook.
https://t.co/KnplC2nlqiGreat Story in the WSJ. While the deficits caused by mandatory spending is concerning, the #TaxCutsandJobsAct is growing the economy at the fastest rate we've seen since '05. Based off CBO model, they've paid for about 30% of the cost in just 4 months. https://t.co/ZekEDPLMSSOn April 12th, we remember the six million innocent men, women, and children who were slaughtered during the Holocaust. But it's important that we not only remember, we must be vigilant to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. https://t.co/0PnIvPadqoMore coverage of our questioning of Mark Zuckerberg yesterday. 
https://t.co/fziB9V6bS8Currently, Facebook is enabling illegal activity and, in so doing, hurting people. In  his testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he is responsible for the content on his site, which is why we’re calling on him to take down these ads and take steps to prevent them in the future.Illegal online pharmacies are using Facebook to circumvent the law, and allow people to buy highly addictive drugs without a prescription. This is directly aiding in the destruction of so many lives. 
https://t.co/BELGyZJOJu@facebook make sure these ads are taken down quicker in the future, and develop the AI to automatically keep them from appearing. The opioid epidemic is ravaging rural America, and we all need to do our part to fight back, including social media platforms. https://t.co/AAkBv2NDBtIllegal online pharmacies are using Facebook to circumvent the law, and allow people to buy highly addictive drugs without a prescription. When will Facebook step up and stop enabling the sale of these dangerous pills on their platform? #ZuckerbergHearing  https://t.co/kZ1nUJp4LzWV has the highest rate of opioid deaths in the nation: 52 per 100,000 residents. It's time for @facebook to stop enabling the illegal sale of these dangerous pills on their platform. #ZuckerbergHearing https://t.co/VNDA5DiVkqWV leads the nation in opioid overdose deaths: 52 per 100,000 citizens. Is it really too much to ask that @facebook prevent these pills from being sold on their platform? They seem adept at blocking other types of content... #ZuckerbergHearingWhen is @facebook going to follow through and stop allowing illegal online pharmacies to sell opioids on their platform? #ZuckerbergHearingWhile we are sad to see such a close friend leave us at the end of this term, we respect his desire to spend more time with his family. Thank you for your leadership @SpeakerRyan!@SpeakerRyan didn't seek the position, but he answered the call and provided steadfast leadership to the House of Representatives. The hours in Congress are long, and the sacrifices made can relegate one to the status of "weekend dad" at times. 
https://t.co/nfGdmx833T•We look forward to Mr. Zuckerberg answering our questions and providing answers to the American people, helping all of us better understand what happens to our personal information online. #ZuckerbergHearing https://t.co/WNC3YQOQw4Our Committee will be live at 10:00 am with @facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.

https://t.co/CA1tvxmRDLTo date, they have helped First District citizens claim nearly $4 million dollars that they were entitled to. Our office is here to serve the First District, and we look forward to the next 6,000 cases we can help resolve.From the time a call comes in from a constituent who needs help, they’re on the ball. They’re vigilant and they don’t take “no” for an answer from a federal agency. They’ve been so successful that they often have people from outside of the district calling them for help.Reaching a milestone this big is no easy task, and I want to take a moment and thank our dedicated Caseworkers: Linda Wooldridge in Morgantown, Robert “Bob” Villers in Parkersburg, and Chantel Young in Wheeling.Our office recently completed its' 6,000th constituent case. When a constituent needs help, whether it’s securing hearing aids from Medicare or receiving benefits from the VA, our staff has stepped in to help them find a resolution to their issue.
