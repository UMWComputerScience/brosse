https://t.co/iZXyXD7t6xI sure will, @ShannonBream! 

Everyone, join us on @FoxNews at 8:40pm AZT/11:40pm ET as I discuss how rigorous fighter pilot training prepared pioneers like myself and Tammie Jo Shults to keep a cool head and handle emergencies. https://t.co/dm2JtPwrZPIt doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a boy or a girl; the airplane doesn‚Äôt care if you have ovaries or not, as long as you have the qualifications &amp; the training to complete the mission ‚Äì and Tammie Jo Shults did that yesterday. 
My thoughts w/@TaskandPurpose ‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/A68FGSeOieThe days of the weak Obama Administration are behind us. @realDonaldTrump's 
decision to send Pompeo to meet w/Kim Jong Un shows resolute leadership. The President will use economic pressure, military action, &amp; diplomacy to  denuclearize the Korean peninsula. Watch on @FoxNews: https://t.co/Z98tdj28GJHAPPENING NOW: Tune into @FoxNews to join my conversation with @TeamCavuto about the air strikes in #Syria.I enjoyed visiting with students from St. Michael‚Äôs School in Tucson during their visit to D.C.! Thank you for your engaging questions about life in Congress. https://t.co/TuNN09NGzWThanks to her nerves of steel, Tammie Jo Shults safely landed the @SouthwestAir Boeing 737 full of passengers yesterday after the engine explosion. Unsurprisingly, she was already a hero‚Äîone of the first women to fly a fighter jet for the @USNavy!
 https://t.co/RGU8CKuTnYArizona sure represented at the #BostonMarathon! Congrats to former @ASU #sundevil @des_linden ‚Äì the 1st American woman to win the Boston Marathon in 33 yrs! And congrats to Tucson resident Sarah Sellers Callister for finishing 2nd. Who run the world?

https://t.co/jVAhwVrFv0Today, America lost a woman who has shaped our country with her faith, her principles, and her service. Former First Lady Barbara Bush‚Äôs life ended the way she lived it: with courage, confidence &amp; care for others.  I‚Äôm reflecting on her indelible legacy &amp; praying for her family. https://t.co/KU3YSNoWNrFamilies and business throughout Arizona are already seeing their wages rise, their benefits expand, and their job opportunities grow because of the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. Read about how it is changing Mesa, Arizona in the @EVTNow ‚û°Ô∏è
https://t.co/b51L7rOPlRToday is the last day we have to file under the burdensome, old tax code. The new tax code is already making a big difference in Arizona! Read about how @EdmundOptics is buying more equipment, training more employees &amp; creating more jobs in Tucson ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/md3sF3mSI8 https://t.co/PS3IN5D9I6Under our OLD system, American taxpayers spent $99 BILLION each year complying with the individual income tax. The new tax code will be simpler. Check out the new calculator the IRS created to make taxes easier for families moving forward. ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/gzEVJuSRE9 https://t.co/4GGZXmIk2kToday's the LAST #TaxDay we file under the 32 year old tax code. Under our new tax code, we lowered individual tax rates so that more Americans will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money. A typical middle income family of 4 in #AZ02 will see a tax cut of $2,148! https://t.co/6g7cPrkEiMThe new tax code is better than our old tax code because it repeals Obamacare‚Äôs individual mandate, giving families the freedom to buy the healthcare plan that is right for them. It also provides relief from an Obamacare tax hike affecting the medical expense deduction. #TaxDay https://t.co/pURcUJktJIUnder our old tax code, America had the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world‚Äî35%. Under our new code, we slash the rate to 21%. We STOP encouraging companies to shift or leave funds offshore &amp; START encouraging investment here. Businesses are already moving back! https://t.co/GFtbVsZSBpToday is the LAST DAY we file under the old tax code! Who are the biggest winners under the new code? Hard-working families. Middle-income taxpayers get the largest percentage tax cut, and families making $20,000 to $50,000 will see the largest percentage reductions. #TaxDay https://t.co/iqLAPKP4SdThe new tax code is better than the old because it gives substantial relief to families. We doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per child, plus a $500 tax credit for other dependents. Lower taxes, larger standard deduction &amp; expanded child tax credits = more $ for families. https://t.co/7RyxiOAwJ3Why is the new tax code better than the old? By nearly doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, the #TaxCutsandJobsAct effectively offers taxpayers a zero tax rate on more of their income. #TaxDay https://t.co/mibDiZkIOZToday is the LAST DAY that Arizonan families will file taxes under the old burdensome, outdated tax code. Starting tomorrow, our new tax code is in full effect. We‚Äôre already seeing the impact the #TaxCutsandJobsAct is making in Arizona, &amp; our economy is just getting warmed up. https://t.co/fyNhBEBytsI appreciate John Bolton's grasp of the complex threats we face &amp; our options to deter, diminish &amp; eliminate them. Read my thoughts in the @WashTimes on why John Bolton is exceptionally qualified to serve as National Security Adviser to @realDonaldTrump. 
https://t.co/RDmcolPXhjVery proud to lead the effort w/@RepBiggs to expand AMBER Alert to include tribal lands. Thank you, @realdonaldtrump for signing this into law to bring Arizonan kids safely home! No child should be outside the protection of law enforcement.

The United States has a sovereign right to determine where we place our US Embassy. üáÆüá± #SOTUUnder President @realdonaldtrump we are destroying ISIS safe havens in Iraq and Syria, and finally standing up to North Korea--as well as revisionist powers like China and Russia. #SOTUOnly 5 of the Army's 58 brigades are combat ready. Less than half of the Navy's aircraft can fly. 80% of the Marine Corps aviation units  lack ready basic aircraft. The Air Force is short 2,000 pilots. We MUST rebuild our military! The #NDAA authorizes the biggest boost in years.The Opioids epidemic is a nationwide crisis that continues to ravage communities and claim lives in Arizona. Thankful that #POTUS understands we need to crack down on cartels trafficking drugs across the border, and support recovery in our communities.Both of the recent New York terrorist attackers entered the country as a result of our failed immigration system that favors family connections and randomized selection over merit based values. We have to end #ChainMigration and the #LotteryProgram.America accepts 1 million immigrants annually, and most are low or unskilled. In fact,  right now only 1 out of every 15 U.S. immigrants enter because of their skills. We must move towards a merit-based immigration system so America can be safe and prosperous. #SOTU#POTUS is right ‚û°Ô∏è We MUST close loopholes in our immigration system, or else we'll face the same problems again, even if we 100% secure the border. #SOTUWorking w/ #POTUS Congress must get funding &amp; regulatory certainty to expedite the completion of projects like the Sonoran Corridor ($32.2BIL annual impact on our AZ regional economy) &amp; I-11 to enhance transportation &amp; cross border commerce w/Mexico &amp; Canada markets.In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.
