Glad we could connect! #utpol https://t.co/ScKqXZmUMrBreaking News on @DougWrightShow that there is movement from @SenDems on #shutdown2018  
I will continue to support #CHIP AND #immigration 
#utpol https://t.co/KI8ZNpfZihI‚Äôm going on @kslnewsradio @DougWrightShow to talk about the #shutdown in a moment‚Äî tune in! 
#utpolIt's #shutdown2018 day 3, but I'm working to end it.
-I supported #CHIP in Nov, Dec and Jan.  I will continue to support it.
-I'm working on a #bipartisan #DACA fix. I will keep working on it.
-I'm reaching across the aisle to end the shutdown.
#utpolDay 2 of the #SchumerShutdown w/ @SenDems keeping #CHIP from Utah children, affecting the #military and #NationalSecurity. The American people deserve better. #utpol https://t.co/QxkpcBIH0CIf members of the military aren‚Äôt getting paid during the government shutdown, then I‚Äôm not accepting a salary either. #utpol #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/W1X8vnx4lzMy letter requesting my pay be withheld until the #SchumerShutdown ends. #utpol https://t.co/JI6vbwMuC5I am frustrated and angered by @SenDems, whose unacceptable action has shut down the federal government.  In light of this, I have requested my pay be withheld until the #SchumerShutdown ends.  #utpolLet's be clear, we WANT a DACA fix, but that‚Äôs not the deadline that is at our door. Let‚Äôs keep the focus on getting 9 million children (20,000 in Utah)  the health care they deserve. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/JgzNbBx1tE
#utpolToday, the #CapitolPolice are working w/o pay because of the #SchumerShutdown  Thank you for your service. https://t.co/ZElMv16E8pUtah's Mighty 5 Nat'l Parks are partially open during this #SchumerShutdown That's good news, and different than during Dem shutdown in 2013
https://t.co/Pt30PEYyp4I'm hoping for a quick resolution to the #SchumerShutdown .
In the House, I voted FOR the 20,000 Utah kids on CHIP.  I hope the @SenDems will do the same. 
#utpol https://t.co/IjvOCKqqcdThe NO vote from @SenateDems took health care from 9 million children who rely on the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program every day. #SchumerShutdown #utpol 
https://t.co/JgzNbBx1tESenate Democrats must accept responsibility for the #ShumerShutdown 
I'm very disappointed this has happened.
#utpolAn example of how the private sector can bring constructive change without the need for more government.  This will bring costs down, while maintaining quality healthcare.  #GenericDrugs #Pharmaceuticals @Intermountain #utpol

#utpolTonight, I voted with the majority in the House of Representatives to prevent a disastrous shutdown, and to ensure funding for #CHIP.  Shame on House Democrats who voted to end long term funding for #CHIP and for shutting down the government. 
#utpolI support my colleague @RepRobBishop with his medical marijuana research bill.
