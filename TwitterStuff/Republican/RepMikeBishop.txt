There's absolutely nothing in this funding bill that Democrats are opposing &amp; they're advancing a reckless shutdown strategy.That‚Äôs why I introduced the Great Lakes Oil Spill Prevention Act to ensure we have timely &amp; accurate info about pipeline safety risks. The bill will also hold pipeline operators financially accountable in the case of a disaster. https://t.co/qlBeuU9zOzThe Great Lakes are more than just water.
