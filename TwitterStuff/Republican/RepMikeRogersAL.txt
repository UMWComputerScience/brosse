A joke that we are the ones that don’t have an accent and everyone else does.  It is disgusting that these radical liberal groups are pushingin the State of Alabama.  I have known Brock a long time in Alabama and actually had breakfast with him and my colleagues before the Homeland Security Full Committee hearing last week.  My opening remarks directed at Brock Long were, “Mr. Long, it is refreshing to have a witnessFAKE NEWS is what this all boils down to.
