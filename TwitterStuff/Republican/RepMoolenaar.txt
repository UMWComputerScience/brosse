Now sanctions can be used again to get a better deal with Iran and stop it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.The nuclear deal gave Iran, the leading state-sponsor of terrorism, billions of dollars and it used that money to terrorize people around the world. Iran's aggression &amp; hostility towards America &amp; Israel is why I rejected this bad deal when Pres. Obama proposed it 3 years ago.Congratulations to @MontcalmCC's nursing graduates! I wish them all the best as they serve others in our communities. https://t.co/TQzt22j5raThank-you to Parker Hannifin for the invitation to visit last week.

Amy and I join our nation in praying for President Bush and the entire Bush family as they mourn the loss of a wonderful woman.Barbara Bush was an amazing woman. She was fiercely loyal, funny, witty, and plain-spoken. She was married to the love of her life for 73 years, and together they served our country with grace and class as President and First Lady. https://t.co/qokPkoxnUrThat's funny.
