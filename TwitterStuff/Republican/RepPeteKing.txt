Shameful for Dem elected officials to be caving to leftwing progressive hysteria against @ICEgov. ICE is key weapon vs. MS-13. ICE saves lives of innocent immigrants. Time for Dem leaders to stand against progressive zeitgeist and support ICE and immigrant lives. Show some guts.Time for Dem leaders to be responsible and denounce anti-ICE madness. Innocent immigrant lives are at risk.Essential that Americans stand with and support @ICEgov. ICE does so much to combat MS-13 and save innocent immigrant lives. MS-13 must be crushed; ICE must be defended!Very positive meeting in Washington, DC with Long Island representatives of the Armenian National Committee.
