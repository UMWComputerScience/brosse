That is why today I sent a letter to @HouseAppropsGOP &amp; House Leadership urging continued funding for Hurricane Matthew recovery efforts. @BladenOnline 

https://t.co/8WO1JnwUkYLast year, Hurricane Matthew damaged nearly 98000 homes and 19500 businesses in Eastern NC. Many of those impacted are still in dire need of relief. 

So today, I sent a letter to @HouseAppropsGOP &amp; House Leadership urging continued funding for Hurricane Matthew recovery efforts. https://t.co/FLOqzs0WeSThe selfless service of our military men and women has secured the freedoms and liberties that we all enjoy.

1. Secures the border
2. Upholds the rule of law
3. Puts Americans firstTaxpayers shouldn’t be forced to support abortions and the Govt shouldn’t be giving any preferential tax treatment to abortion providers.Planned Parenthood built a abortion clinic with taxpayer funded municipal bonds.

These additional amounts, while necessary, beg for fiscally responsible offsetsSupport for Puerto Rico?  Absolutely.  Today's disaster relief bill?  Absolutely not, without suitable accountability."Disaster relief" bill included $16 billion bailout of National Flood Insurance Program. No reforms to address waste, protect taxpayersDisaster relief is necessary, but no effort has been made to trim expenses elsewhere in DC to help pay for it.When hardworking American families face unexpected expenses, they find offsets in family budget.  That's real life, but not in D.C.America must help those in need, including Puerto Rico, but we must do so responsibly.  Today's legislation wasn't responsible.The tragedy in #LasVegas is absolutely heartbreaking. My prayers are with the families torn apart by last night’s evil. https://t.co/OOrMurOUUiTax code not updated since #CrocodileDundee was in theaters.
