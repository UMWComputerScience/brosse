Each year I’m thrilled &amp; impressed by the talents of Mainers from high schools across our State. Check out all of the artwork here: https://t.co/qo0ZIiiXmRCongrats to Isobel Straub, a senior at Rangeley Lakes Regional School, for having her outstanding artwork “Wait” named winner of this year’s #CongressionalArtCompetition for Maine’s 2nd District!

#mepoliticsI’m working toward a commonsense solution to protect the environment, local wildlife, the local community residents &amp; small businesses, &amp; these hundreds of jobs in Washington County #mepoliticsHowever, FERC is preventing this transfer from happening, meaning Woodland may have to remove the dam, which would result in devastating consequences for the entire region by drastically changing river &amp; lake levels &amp; displacing local wildlife, residents &amp; jobs #mepoliticsDue to the costly new regs, the dam owners—Woodland Pulp mill that employs approximately 500 Mainers—worked w/ state &amp; local government to allow the State of Maine to assume ownership of the dam #mepoliticsAfter decades of operating under sensible &amp; important regulation without issue, the Forest City Dam in Washington County had recently been forced to adhere to new &amp; potentially devastating licensing requirements from a federal regulator in Washington, DC known as FERC #mepoliticsVIDEO - 500 Jobs in Downeast Maine: This morning I spoke on the House Floor to advocate for a solution to the costly &amp; unnecessary regulations that are unfairly being imposed on a small dam on the St. Croix River
#mepolitics https://t.co/yyNB1YRMyLToday’s measures will mandate stronger protections for victims, require Members of Congress to personally pay for any settlements to victims, and creates an office where employees can get help and guidance immediately. These reforms are long overdue
#mepoliticsBREAKING: The House just passed sweeping changes in harassment claims policy on Capitol Hill, something I've been advocating for w/ a bipartisan group of lawmakers: https://t.co/x9HaLy06pd
#mepoliticsICYMI: Our bipartisan bill, authored with @chelliepingree  to support Maine’s sea urchin harvesters passed the House last night. There are about 650 jobs in the industry statewide in Maine.

#mepoliticsMinnie is very disappointed w/ @SteveCollinsSJ https://t.co/p2SsLf0lyfIn regards to the news reports concerning the train crash, Congressman Poliquin was on board, but is okay with a few minor bruises.

#mepolitics https://t.co/heehO4B6iXCongrats to the more than 100 hardworking Mainers at @FlyBGR on a record successful year!

Bangor Airport is an economic hub for the area, connecting travelers and businesses from around the country and the world every day. Maine is open for business! https://t.co/utpOeP8lxA@wimsatweets For years, Joy has been closely involved in helping Maine Veterans in numerous ways. I am very honored to have Joy serve on my Veteran Advisory Panel as the Chair of Waldo County https://t.co/SatZoPHtKoICYMI: Joy Asuncion of Waldo County, a U.S. Navy Veteran who served for more than 20 years, got an awesome shoutout in this year’s “The Register,” the annual publication for @wimsatweets https://t.co/vT3zdWRHn4#mepolitics https://t.co/xHn7FQaHviI will not be accepting a dime while this dysfunction in Washington goes on and will continue working with lawmakers of both parties on ways forward
#mepoliticsWhile Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate hold the government hostage over politics, Mainers are the ones who lose. It is outrageous that anyone in Congress continues to collect a paycheck while critical services and the federal government remain unfunded
#mepoliticsI voted to avert a government shutdown. And now I am refusing any pay while the government is not funded and will be donating my pay to the Good Shepherd Food Bank
#mepoliticsI’ve said that a shutdown would be a failure in leadership. Failure in leadership in both parties—but particularly in the Senate—has brought us to this point, and it is unacceptable (5/5) #mepoliticsPut simply: a government shutdown CANNOT be blamed on a single party—this is a problem that Democrats and Republicans share (4/5) #mepoliticsThe House voted to keep the government open and avert a shutdown, with the support of Democrats and Republicans. 60 votes are needed to pass a bill in the Senate. Neither party has that many seats in the Senate (3/5) #mepoliticsI’m infuriated, as are Mainers who depend on critical services, with what we’ve seen in the past week—Congress bringing the federal government to the brink of shutdown (2/5) #mepoliticsThose who voted against funding the government are playing with fire (1/5) #mepoliticsBREAKING: I just voted to fund the government--including critical gov programs like #LIHEAP--and avert a government shutdown. My full statement:

#mepolitics https://t.co/NyeSsnRuCAAlways great to speak with our coastal Maine fishermen, father and son Josh and Alex, and Emily from @MaineFishermen in my DC office this afternoon! We talked about the importance of our marine industries for Maine's economy and the jobs they support throughout our State https://t.co/OamCDnyaszAs another winter storm comes through Maine today, I am urging Congress to avert a government shutdown that could limit funding for LIHEAP recipients in Maine: https://t.co/0tfgLcJq5e 
#mepoliticsBe sure to check out my op/ed in the @sunjournal outlining my thoughts on immigration reform:

“Securing our borders, permanently fixing our broken immigration system, and thoughtfully addressing the DACA issue is within our reach.”

https://t.co/zeWYAnzw0P
#mepoliticsIn 2013, the government shutdown cost our economy $24 billion &amp; directly hurt Maine jobs &amp; businesses, like those in the hotel and tourism industries. Acadia NP’s visitation was reduced by 76% in October 2013, causing a 13% reduction in tourism-related business (3/3)
#mepoliticsAs I’ve said before, shutting down the government would be a failure in leadership (2/3)
https://t.co/hBRq9bwd2x #mepoliticsA government shutdown is simply unacceptable and we need to find a way to prevent it (1/3)
#mepoliticsAs we honor Martin Luther King, Jr., let’s remember the timeless and transformative legacy he left and the inspiring impact this tremendous American had on our NationWorking together, with Veterans from across Maine, we are pushing forward on doing some real good for those who have served our country
#mepoliticsThe Panel is a unique resource allowing our Veterans from every county in Maine’s 2nd District to convey their ideas and concerns directly to me and to the @HouseVetAffairs , on which I serve
#mepoliticsWe discussed jobs and economic growth for our Veterans, ways to improve access to educational benefits, specific transportation challenges our Veterans are facing in rural areas, and efforts to make timely care and treatment for Veterans more accessible
#mepoliticsEarlier today, my Veteran Advisory Panel conducted our quarterly in-person meeting in Bangor, touching on several different topics and issues affecting Maine Veterans
#mepolitics https://t.co/aGz3wtXQqCThis morning I also sat down w/ @JoyHollowell in the studio at @WABI_TV5 to talk about immigration reform, our bipartisan efforts to fight against the opioid epidemic in ME, &amp; issues I’m working on to help our Vets, specifically with my Veteran Advisory Panel. Be sure to tune in! https://t.co/0RHrIXwtuBI joined @RicTyler &amp; George Hale this morning in the #WVOM studio to talk about securing our borders, reforming our immigration system, and combating the heroin epidemic in a bipartisan way. Listen to our discussion here: https://t.co/3QXOBtKreY
#mepolitics https://t.co/ahIE6eYEIG@ForestResources Note for clarification--

Tonight's event was in Brewer, not Bangor. Apologies for the error in the previous tweetHad a great time tonight at the @ForestResources Forestry Forum in Bangor. Our forestry industry is one of the pillars of our Maine economy, providing for thousands of jobs. I’m proud to always stand with our hardworking loggers &amp; forest products workers across Maine https://t.co/qPijTyUiUhI believe this new guidance from @CMSGov is an important step in getting more working-age, non-disabled individuals out of the trap of government dependency and in giving them a better opportunity to succeed (3/3)
#mepoliticsIndividual states like Maine, each with their own unique communities, know best how to administer their welfare programs and how best to serve the interests of their own citizens (2/3)
#mepoliticsThe goal of our federal welfare programs should be to give individuals the opportunities they need to succeed and become self-supporting and independent (1/3)
#mepoliticsToday I’ll be standing w/ Democrats and Republicans of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force as we put forward our agenda for 2018 to continue to combat the opioid epidemic in Maine and around the nation. Stay tuned #mepoliticsFrom our local police depts. throughout Maine to the officers of the Capitol Police down in Washington, thank you to all of our brave &amp; hardworking men &amp; women in law enforcement for serving &amp; sacrificing to protect our families every single day
#LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/BvDIgznte6Please everyone stay safe and as warm as possible this morning and afternoon as this storm moves across our State. Be sure to check the @MaineEMA webpage for updates and details on the storm in your area:
https://t.co/pYLidDrTtwFrom my family to yours, please have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Please remember to thank all those keeping our communities and homeland safe this holiday seasonIt will allow small businesses in all industries to benefit from it. We are giving our small businesses—the backbone of Maine’s economy—relief so they can grow and create more jobs for our fellow Mainers
#mepoliticsThis improved tax code will also greatly benefit the more than 140,000 small businesses and job creators throughout Maine and their 275,000 employees by lowering the effective rate for pass-throughs, of which almost all small businesses are organized
#mepoliticsIn addition, this increases the child tax credit to $2,000, meaning the average Maine family will save an additional $2,000 on their taxes per child in their family. This makes it easier for ordinary Maine families to benefit from the tax code
#mepoliticsUnder this simpler tax code, we are doubling the standard deduction, meaning the average married couple in Maine will not pay any federal income tax for the first $24,000 they earn, a huge boost for our families
#mepoliticsThis new law will drastically simplify our tax code for the vast majority of Mainers and save more money for more of our hardworking families
#mepoliticsBig news today: My bipartisan bill to help nearly 900 Maine families, who make their living from clam and worm harvesting, just cleared a key step toward a final vote in the House
#mepolitics https://t.co/KDNh54PzsLHBD to the @USNationalGuard!
 
Thank you to the men and women who serve in the Maine National Guard and who keep our communities, our State and Nation safeSoon, I'll be talking on the House Floor to discuss my bill that we'll be voting on later today, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act.

May we always remember their sacrifices and courage #PearlHarbor76It’s time to move on and move forward, so that we can help build a stronger economy for the region and for Maine (3/3)
#mepoliticsAs I’ve said before, our goal should be to move this project forward in the right way to build a stronger economy that creates more and better paying jobs in the Katahdin Region and in Maine. Secretary Zinke’s recommendation strikes the right balance (2/3)
#mepoliticsThe recommendation put forward by Secretary Zinke is a smart compromise that will help ensure traditional uses of the land and sustainable forest management are safeguarded, along with the jobs they support in the area (1/3)
#mepolitics https://t.co/VMapO9Y1H8TODAY: I’m urging Congress to find a permanent legislative solution for DACA before the end of the year.
