Pompeo secured the release of 3 American hostages - that does not sound like a failure to me. He has been negotiating with N. Korea and they have decided not to hold up their end. Regardless of the outcome, you would not have been pleased with our presidentFor years, the stability of the N. Korean regime has been a contentious issue &amp; unfortunately, their recent hostility has caused a severe missed opportunity. I trust that @POTUS and @StateDept @SecPompeo are working hard with America‚Äôs best interest in mindI applaud @POTUS' decision to cancel the summit at this time. The US and our allies must continue to pressure North Korea to denuclearize, and I encourage the administration to halt negotiations until we know Kim Jung Un is serious about achieving peace and prosperity https://t.co/NYdfhc5d94All of this is critical to keeping Americans safe, and I look forward to this bill making it to the @POTUS's desk as quickly as possibleAs the representative of #TX25, I have fought on behalf of @forthood for an #NDAA that will ensure military readiness. This legislation will directly affect our servicemen and women in Central Texas, and around the globe, by giving them the tools they need to fight and win.PASSED ‚Üí The #FY19NDAA

For far too long, we‚Äôve expected our troops to do more with less. We‚Äôve expected them to defend our country, at home and abroad, in substandard conditions with inadequate equipment.

https://t.co/nfSaRnIV9H@metellusUX @GovWaste You'll notice certain words in the online article are blue - that is because they are hyperlinked to a legitimate source. I wouldn't spew facts unless I had something to cite them with.@bri_randy @mpcrider @DanPatrick Possession of guns by minors is not legal. Bringing a firearm into school is not legal. Murdering is not legal. 

Those who are law-abiding citizens aren't the ones we need to worry about. If you take guns away from Americans, the good guys will turn them in. The bad guys won't.@traetd @JulieForTX25 That's correct. There should absolutely NOT be a special pathway to citizenship for #DACA recipients. We have rules in place for a reason and each person who wants to become an American citizen must go through the same legal process as everyone else.@Authentic_EI @GovWaste I promise you I am working hard to ensure these tax cuts are permanent for all Americans.@Jerry_ATX Sorry for not answering your question entirely. I am not afraid of meeting with the great people of #TX25. In fact, I do it all the time when I'm in Austin, Cleburne and everywhere in between@mommyof3LAL @HaganforHouse It's more than just one time bonuses; 90% of Americans are seeing MORE in their paychecks as well@joolytron @rollcall @Walmart states, "Tax reform gives us the opportunity to be more competitive globally and to accelerate plans for the U.S.‚Äù

https://t.co/hiKfH3j2U7@joolytron @rollcall Corporations and small businesses have already given over $4 BILLION to over 4 MILLION employees since the #TaxCutsandJobsAct was signed into law@HurricaneFetta @hugandpint Read all about it: "Under those new tables, the Treasury estimates that 90% of people who get a paycheck are likely to see more in take-home pay, as soon as February."

https://t.co/h0KDqa1BHM@Jerry_ATX It can be tough to get on news stations that only want to discuss what the President is tweeting about. I'm ready to talk about real issues and real legislation in this country on any media platform@metellusUX @hugandpint 'Lol' is right. It IS funny when the majority of Americans are receiving MORE money in their paychecks and Democrats still try and convince you that the #TaxCutsandJobsAct isn't working@HurricaneFetta @hugandpint Considering that 90% of Americans are seeing MORE money in the paychecks, I'd say there's a pretty good chance they believe it's working@2GreekBrothers @kmjoseph @GOP The fact that #taxreform is working is not a lie.
- I'm working to make tax cuts PERMANENT for every one
- $1,000 is a lot of money to many hardworking families
- 90% of ppl are seeing MORE $ in their paychecks - fastest wage growth in yrs
The #TaxCutsandJobsAct works 4 everyone!@HaganforHouse Over 4 MILLION Americans have received over $4 BILLION in bonuses from small businesses, corporations, etc. #Taxreform IS working in this country@twistopherrobin @bri_randy I meet with constituents around #TX25 every single time I'm home (i.e. not voting in Washington). And when I am in Washington, myself and my staff meet with every constituent that requests a meeting or stops by the office in an effort to hear their ideas and concerns.@mpcrider @bri_randy Of course not. I'm not OK with suicides at all. However, taking guns away from law-abiding citizens is not the answer.
