Stay up-to-date on #TaxReform by visiting https://t.co/iTQrlGki6P or texting "TAX REFORM" to 50589!#TaxReform has been enacted for six months now! How much do you know about the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct?

Take this quiz to find out: https://t.co/fkAgLGK1NJThis is a great opportunity we see in front of us, as President Trump has promised to nominate someone who is committed to upholding our Constitution, yet again. I trust he will do just that, and urge the Senate to act quickly on the confirmation of the nominee.Americans do not want judges who "legislate from the bench." Rather, we simply seek fair and impartial judges who will rule according to an intellectually honest, historically accurate, and unbiased interpretation of our Constitution. That's it!Justice Kennedy announced his retirement after serving on the bench of the #SupremeCourt for more than 30 years this week. I thank him for his service to our nation.

I am very optimistic about his replacement that @POTUS will soon nominate.The Guardian Award is given to Members of Congress for tireless efforts on behalf of senior citizens, as so many of our elderly struggle on a fixed income. Seniors have to live within their means and so should our government.Honored to have received the @60PlusAssoc Guardian of Seniors' Rights award from music legend Pat Boone. https://t.co/los4254DBxPASSED: H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act - which increases funding for our military to $674.6 billion. 

Full statement here: https://t.co/bmDOHzh7w4It is #WastefulWednesday! https://t.co/2a4or5Tya7Wow, the Supreme Court this week:

- Deeming @realDonaldTrump's travel ban Constitutional
- Siding w/ the 1st Amendment, so pro-life centers are not forced to promote abortions
- Siding with workers who do not wish to join unions
- the retirement announcement of Justice KennedyThough she also mentioned she has “no sympathy for [those] people”, I certainly hope she will reconsider her comments and offer a public apology.The fact that Congressman Steve Scalise was shot, &amp; nearly killed, a yr ago for being a Republican, while playing baseball, is exactly why these comments are so dangerous. What does this say about our country? This only exacerbates the issue, &amp; deepens our political divide.The recent rhetoric coming from Rep. Waters, and the left, is hate filled, dangerous, and unacceptable. She shouted to a crowd of people to harass  individuals that simply have differing political viewpoints.Today I, along with six original co-sponsors, introduced a House Resolution to censure Rep. Maxine Waters for her divisive comments this past Saturday at a rally in California. https://t.co/hMpEsJ09QXThe @USSupremeCourt ruled to uphold @POTUS' constitutional right to protect America. I thank Pres. @realDonaldTrump for his strong commitment to #MakeAmericaSafeAgain. https://t.co/esU896AJTjAbout to go LIVE on @IngrahamAngle Radio Show to talk about the left's dangerous rhetoric encouraging the harassment of people with different viewpoints. Hope you can tune in!We are more than this as a country and a society. This is not the American process that our Founding Fathers envisioned. As we go forward, it is critical that all of us conduct ourselves in ways that will only unite us, not divide.This kind of reckless behavior must be condemned and those who openly advocate for the harassment of people with differing viewpoints must be held accountable.Encouraging and inciting violence is never the answer. The recent rhetoric coming from Rep. Maxine Waters, and the left, is fueled with hatred, dangerous, and downright unacceptable.I introduced the Fly Act to provide greater transparency for the American people and prevent those in high-level positions from abusing power. It will also save hard-earned dollars in the long run.

Thank you for all the birthday wishes! https://t.co/hYl7UuDlcL@JeremyT1231 Thank you Jeremy!While we must work to make these #taxcuts permanent for everyone, we should at least start with those who deserve it most — the men and women of our armed forces.

This week the House plans to vote on two immigration bills, one of which will include a provision ending the family separation policy. I plan on supporting both bills.As a father of 4 and a grandfather of 16, I don’t think any children should be taken away from their parents unless they are in danger. 

While families do need to be kept together, we also need much tougher border security.Wishing every dad a #HappyFathersDay today! https://t.co/q3geejuOppOur economy is continuing to improve because of pro-growth policies and #taxreform.

If you, or anyone else you know, is struggling... please know that help is available and you are not alone.

Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255. #TalkSavesLivesThe FLY Act would not only provide greater transparency for the American people, prevent those in high-level positions from abusing power, but it will also save hard-earned dollars in the long run.By requiring the heads of the agencies to report their travel, those in power will be held accountable for how they utilize taxpayer dollars, encouraging them to do so efficiently and not abuse their position by going on luxurious trips.Last week I introduced the Formally List Your Travel (FLY) Act which would require all federal agency heads to submit their official travel logs to the Government Accountability Office on a more regular basis and restrict them from flying first-class. https://t.co/V7uOC3UgdO.@POTUS has brought us a step closer to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and peace. Congrats Pres. @realDonaldTrump for doing what no other President has done!1 MILLION new jobs have been added since #taxreform was enacted...that was just 6 months ago!

Our troops at Shaw Air Force Base &amp; across the country need our support, and we owe it to all the men and women who sacrifice their lives so that we may enjoy our day-to-day libertiesOur troops deserve the best. House passed #NDAA to provide much needed funding for our military. NDAA gives our troops biggest pay raise in 9 yrs, updates military infrastructure, restores military readiness &amp; provides funds for them to face global threats of the 21st Century. https://t.co/50FYEAvXkvThank you for coming in and meeting with me @sccepnews ! https://t.co/CWbgXSNz52No private organization should be given taxpayer $$$ to use. The Asia Foundation was founded in 1954, and functioned prior to receiving funds from the federal government.This is just another example of how Washington has developed the awful habit of throwing money down the drain.In FY 2017, the Asia Foundation’s budget was $100 million dollars. $83 million came from the private sector, and $17 million came from taxpayers. If this private, non-profit organization can raise $83 million, then why must taxpayers foot an extra $17 million? That is ludicrous.You know what day it is... #WastefulWednesday! Today, I introduced a bill to prohibit any federal agency from providing funds to The Asia Foundation, a private, non-profit international development organization.Happy Birthday to the great state of #SouthCarolina! On May 23, 1788, SC became the 8th state admitted to the union. 

"Dum Spiro Spero"Today @HouseScience hears from @ENERGY, @soldierstrong, @R2RProjectHero, and @NUFeinbergMed on cutting-edge technology designed to improve our U.S. #veterans’ quality of life.

Read my blog post on it here: https://t.co/fOgadd6hJcSee why small business optimism is through the roof by visiting https://t.co/iTQrlGki6P or text “TAX REFORM” to 50589.Did you know that the unemployment rate is at 3.9%? ...that’s the lowest since 2000! Our pro-growth policies are working and spurring economical growth. https://t.co/iTQrlGki6PThank you to all the heroic men and women who have sacrificed everything to protect and defend this country. #ArmedForcesDay https://t.co/3U55glp9IRThe #VAMissionAct is a great step in the right direction for the VA to start fulfilling their promises. These reforms will drastically help ensure that our #veterans are getting the care they need and have earned, and in a timely manner too. https://t.co/kDdGzLQLgyThis will ensure these first responders are not burdened later on in life.When I found out that these heroic public servants lose their tax-free status, I was shocked. It’s simply not right to allow someone, who put their lives on the line, to receive tax breaks and then start taxing them when they reach, what would’ve been, their retirement age.Today I introduced the Putting Our First Responders First Act.This bill would tremendously aid first responders who become permanently disabled in the line-of-duty.
https://t.co/F1ksM4zsgqIt's #WastefulWednesday! 

Today, I introduced a bill that would eliminate the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) within the US Agency for International Development (USAID). 

View my full statement: https://t.co/ZF0DjJxDmwToday we honored all the heroic men &amp; women of law enforcement who lost their lives on the line of duty at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service.May we always remember the sacrifices that our police forces make everyday to ensure that we are protected. #NationalPoliceWeek https://t.co/HJbtrVpMT1I visited the SC Highway Patrol to bring them cupcakes &amp; thank them for their service. As we honor #NationalPoliceWeek, let us be extremely grateful for the many men and women of our communities' police forces. Day in and day out, they put their lives on the line to keep us safe. https://t.co/hw3bxcTaJ1By moving our embassy to Jerusalem, we are finally recognizing that Jerusalem is Israel’s rightful and eternal capital–which will no longer be questioned. I applaud @POTUS and his determination to finally do what no other president has been willing to do.The holy city, #Jerusalem, is finally rightfully home to our embassy. Let today’s dedication be a world-wide reminder that America stands with Israel, our greatest ally.#HappyMothersDay to my beautiful wife Elaine, my daughters and daughter-in-law, and every mom! Thank you for the unconditional love you show everyday. https://t.co/KUBcTrKamiThis is not a matter of national concern worthy of hundreds of thousands of dollars. NSF should allocate its grant funds to research that will benefit everyday Americans.

The American people deserve better.Over the last year, NSF has spent more than $300,000 of taxpayer funds studying the impact of Dear Colleagues letters, which are written and sent amongst Members of Congress and describe pieces of legislation each office is working on.Today's #WastefulWednesday bill: prohibits the National Science Foundation from studying how Members of Congress interact with each other.My #WastefulWednesday initiative has officially launched!

I am, and each member should be, serious about cutting erroneous spending from grants and programs. Every week for #WastefulWednesday I will introduce a bill to help alleviate our abysmal debt.How can @NancyPelosi say out loud that she wants to RAISE taxes?! Because of #taxreform we have:
- Unemployment at 3.9%
- Added 800,000 new jobs
- Weekly wages increase by avg. $1,300
- #SmallBiz optimism thru the roof

Here is the H.Res. introduced: https://t.co/KFIdgSBONEDay in and day out, teachers all across the nation show extreme dedication to instilling knowledge, dreams, and power into our country’s future. And it does not go unnoticed.Today, I introduced a H.Res honoring our teachers. We all remember those teachers that have deeply impacted each of our lives, and we carry out what we learned from them every day.I appreciate you all stopping by! https://t.co/dpF9pzFyvgThe #IranDeal was a BAD deal. I thank @POTUS for his decision to withdrawal the U.S. from JCPOA and re-impose sanctions. This deal allowed the Iranian regime to continue their evil ways. We must ensure that Iran never develops/obtains nuclear weapons. https://t.co/OOe4uMKQcNI support Pres. @realDonaldTrump's #rescission package, and would like to see where the Democrats stand on billions of stagnant, unspent funds just sitting in agency coffers.Every day Americans are forced to budget and balance their checkbooks, and it is time that the federal government do the same. Although we need to cut even more, this proposal is a step in the right direction.Washington does not have an income problem; Washington has a spending problem. W/ @POTUS' historic $15Bill #rescission package, he clearly understands how reckless federal spending negatively effects not just our economy, but tax-payers in long-run.Every day we are hearing more fantastic news because of #taxreform!

I want like to thank Watson Insurance of the Carolinas, Lake Wylie Tax Services, @BagelBoat, The Office Gym and Fitness Center, @RinehartRealty, @CampThunderbird, and Q2U BBQ Pit for hosting me!If you've been keeping up with my recent tweets, you saw that I've been all over the Fifth District this week to celebrate #NationalSmallBusinessWeek, talk #taxreform, and discuss many other issues hurting small businesses.Great news - for the first time since 2000, our nation's unemployment rate has fallen below 4%! One of the priorities for Congress was to pass tax reform that was pro-growth...this is just more evidence that the #TaxCutsandJobsAct is working!! https://t.co/tgyfhiiJHc😎🌤️🌤️ https://t.co/VTkT9LIMJZI've been all around the district this week, and today I had the opportunity to visit Central Carolina Technical College in Sumter Co. for #NationalDayOfPrayer.

Regardless of our differences, we should always rely on prayer to bring us together and closer to Him. https://t.co/FKbW5608RKThis is exactly why I introduced the SCRAP Act (HR 4981) @RepRoKhanna. This bill would end lifetime perks for retied Members of Congress - such as accessing the Capitol freely and influencing pending legislation. #DrainTheSwamp https://t.co/Xt2epK1cxM@CareSouthC is one of twenty-four community health centers in the district, and combined, they serve over 137,000 patients!

Thank you to all of the great employees at The Home Depot for showing me around and spending time with me to discuss the benefits of #TaxCutsandJobsAct and what work Congress still has to do.When Small Businesses are strong, America is strong. I am proud to continue to fight for @fabfoursinc and the over 400,000 small businesses in or state!Did you know, Fab Fours, Inc. is one of the largest aftermarket bumper manufacturers in the world? In fact, last December, they made a capital investment of $5.7 million in Lancaster County creating roughly 80+ jobs.Today, I had the pleasure of touring and visiting @fabfoursinc plant in Lancaster County to discuss #NationalSmallBusinessWeek and the impacts of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct on small businesses. https://t.co/WwQbjVPbwcHad a fabulous time touring the @DomtarEveryday facility in Rock Hill, SC yesterday and talking about the benefits of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct with the employees. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/wWy18GFqbhThe men and women in uniform put their lives on the line so we may enjoy our day-to-day liberties. I am so honored to introduce the PATCH Act to provide them with even greater tax relief. We cannot thank you all enough!!This bill would take many of the individual tax cuts and provisions from #TaxReform and make them permanent for our troops.Today, in honor of Military Appreciation Month, I introduced the "Permanently Amending Tax Cuts for our Heroes Act" or the PATCH Act.With over 400,000 small businesses all across South Carolina, it is imperative we continue to stick up for the small mom-and-pop shops. #SmallBusinessWeekIt takes heart, determination, risk, and a backbone to start and run a small business. This is probably why small businesses are referred to as the backbone of our nation’s economy.#TaxReform is making positive impacts throughout the 5th District, &amp; country. #TaxCutsAndJobsAct works for the average American &amp; middle-class family. Why? Because more families now have greater opportunities to invest in their futures and get ahead. https://t.co/iTQrlGki6P https://t.co/UmZ3aFPQ4MNearly 80% of American heroin users report misusing prescription opioids first.

That's why I have introduced H.R. 5442, A Fast-Tracked Executive Rescission Review (AFTERR) of Appropriations Act. By creating an expedited process for WH recission requests, Congress would be forced to justify their most egregious pet projects.Setting the Record Straight... https://t.co/dE18X6BhQ9I support @POTUS' decision to authorize the deployment of @USNationalGuard to our southern border.

Plain and simple. #TariffTantrumThese unreasonably high tariffs that will be implemented on steel and aluminum products may sound like a good idea, but in reality, the burden of these tariffs will passed on to the American consumer.Just the mere announcement of imposing high tariffs on materials we use every day has had an impact on the stock market - Dow Jones has fallen 500 pts. This has a far greater impact on trade overall, whether it be on farmers, automobile makers, or manufacturers.We promised a fair and simple tax code, more jobs, and larger pay checks. And we delivered.
