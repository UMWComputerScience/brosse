If his goal was to provide plausible explanations for how his hateful text messages didn't impact his actions and decisions, he failed. 

And if his goal was to bring legitimacy to the FBI and DOJ in the two highest-profile investigations in recent times, he failed miserably.Peter Strzok's 11 hours of sworn testimony this week fell well short of  clearing his good name. https://t.co/UrCIbYDkNBHAPPENING NOW: I'll be questioning Deputy AG Rosenstein &amp; FBI Director Wray in today's @HouseJudiciary hearing. Watch it here: https://t.co/X5T0x9KiRuI'm joining @AmericaNewsroom at 9 a.m. to discuss today's hearing with Rosenstein &amp; Wray. https://t.co/YZZkWDbwiQTODAY: I'm one of just six members of Congress who will question Peter Strzok during his transcribed interview as a part of the ongoing joint investigation into the decisions of the DOJ in 2016 led by @TGowdySC &amp; @RepGoodlatte.Tomorrow Peter Strzok is set to appear before the @HouseJudiciary &amp; @GOPoversight committees for a deposition as a part of our ongoing joint investigation into the decisions of the DOJ in 2016. https://t.co/XOhDb01swRGrateful for today's #SCOTUS decision in #NIFLA v. #Becerra turning back California's attempt to force #prolife pregnancy centers to advertise for the abortion industry. The gov't has no businesses forcing people to express messages that violate their moral or religious beliefs.Peter Strzok has been subpoenaed to appear before the @HouseJudiciary &amp; @GOPoversight committees for a deposition TOMORROW at 10 a.m. as part of our ongoing joint investigation into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016. https://t.co/0ASAGbAR07ICYMI: I'm calling on our top national security officials to look into the Obama administration's response to Russian cyberattacks following confirmation last week of a "stand down" order issued by Susan Rice.
https://t.co/WSu4NNSlmLI commend the House passage of the DHS Industrial Control Systems Capabilities Enhancement Act of 2018 (HR 5733), which supports the work of the ICS experts at NCCIC in providing technical assistance to critical infrastructure owners &amp; operators across the country. @DHSgov @NPPDI'm calling for answers from top national security officials: https://t.co/wyjlot1bHFSusan Rice's "stand down" order in response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election occurred almost simultaneously with the launch of the Trump campaign investigation. 

Was this a politically motivated move by the Obama administration?

https://t.co/8h28ApsJXe https://t.co/JiFvztCx0hBut one week later, Obama admin officials told our own cyber chief to "stand down" and ignore Russian efforts to interfere with our election...
 
So was the Trump investigation really about our national security – or was it politically motivated?On July 31, 2016, the Obama admin initiated an aggressive investigation into the Trump campaign under the pretense that it centered on national security and fear that the Trump campaign may be colluding with the Russians to interfere with our election. https://t.co/stLhMJ0NDPIf your foundational evidence is so corrupted and tainted by how it's been collected, then everything that comes after that – every search warrant that's obtained, every confession that's obtained, even every plea agreement that's entered into – is likewise tainted or poisoned. https://t.co/JMdU2iTyvnIt should raise a serious red flag when the FBI's own independent referee (Horowitz) is deeply troubled that Strzok and other Trump-hating agents and lawyers were collecting evidence and making every decision for the first 9 months of the investigation into the Trump campaign. https://t.co/gQhYsjFQzPCharles Krauthammer will be greatly missed. As we mourn his loss, the extraordinary legacy he left behind will most certainly live on.Yesterday, IG Horowitz confirmed to me under oath that he’ll look into whether the contradiction in their testimonies on this matter are misleading to Congress and the American people. We deserve the truth. https://t.co/JJvFkZcNizIn 2016, Comey told me under oath that he decided not to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton in the email investigation AFTER her interview with the FBI. But this week, IG Horowitz testified that Comey’s decision was made BEFORE her interview.I'm glad the 21st Century IDEA I introduced in the House with @RepRoKhanna is making traction in the Senate with @senrobportman's new companion bill (S.3050). It's time to modernize our federal government. https://t.co/9OVqAvF8MiThe bedrock of our justice system is the fair and impartial administration of justice. We can’t be putting people in charge of investigating people they hate – of people that they are biased and prejudiced against. Yet this is exactly what happened to President Trump. https://t.co/NPKXx9XtDxHAPPENING HOW: Tune in LIVE for today's @HouseJudiciary &amp; @GOPoversight hearing with Michael Horowitz on the #IG report. https://t.co/6nH5HOXNkvTomorrow I'm questioning Michael Horowitz before @HouseJudiciary on the findings in the #IG report.

My preliminary review leads me to believe that President Trump deserved better than he got from the FBI and DOJ.Today the much anticipated IG report is set to be released. I'll be joining @DanaPerino on @dailybriefing to discuss.Wishing my colleagues on the Congressional baseball team good luck in tonight's game.

I was proud to support this critical investment in our national defense, which included the largest pay raise for our troops in nine years. https://t.co/691nVo7drKTaxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for a practice that violates their deeply held moral or religious beliefs about the right to life, and the clear physical and financial divisions required by the recent Title X actions will help us make sure that is not the case.I commend the Trump administration’s newly announced actions to prevent organizations that perform or support abortion as a means of family planning from receiving Title X funds through enhanced restrictions.Last night, the House passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155), which will cut down the red tape that's stopping hardworking Americans from accessing the credit they need to become homeowners, buy a car or expand their small businesses.American companies should refuse to list #Taiwan as a “province/region of #China” on their websites, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has unfairly demanded. 

Here's @RepTedYoho's recent letter to @Delta, @United, &amp; @AmericanAir CEOs on this important issue: https://t.co/HGwIB9tUuFTonight at 7:15 ET I'm joining @marthamaccallum on @TheStoryFNC to discuss the latest on the #Mueller investigation.
