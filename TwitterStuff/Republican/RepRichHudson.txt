@WBTV_News @DavidWhisenant: https://t.co/rJHKCeoB3CAs Fort Bragg’s Congressman and an advocate for military families, I was honored to help with &amp; attend this special event. I want to thank @DeltaChildren &amp; @USOofNC for their incredible work to support our military families. https://t.co/fu5BBNTQX9.@POTUS is right to call the opioid epidemic the crisis next door. It is about our neighbors, our friends and our family members who are suffering. These are real people battling addiction. They are fighting for their lives. And we are fighting with them.

https://t.co/cEYv9PEZTtI’ve heard from a mother whose child started down the dangerous path of drug use &amp; then became addicted to heroin. I’ve seen soldiers &amp; veterans become addicted after being prescribed opioids for injuries sustained in combat or in training. Opioid addiction truly knows no bounds.The opioid abuse statistics are staggering, but as I travel across #NC08, I see the faces and hear the stories that accompany them. I’ve met with a local community leader who became addicted to pain pills following a tough surgery.Yesterday, I was thrilled to recognize Alan Thompson on his retirement as Cabarrus County’s Director of EMS. I am extremely grateful for Alan and his incredible service to our community. His passion for helping others is admirable. https://t.co/CLFl2lSwr7“It’s kind of like my two and a half-year old son. His teeth are not going to get brushed unless I make him brush his teeth,” said Rep. Hudson. “This bureaucracy is not going to get fixed unless Congress makes it get fixed.”

@WBTV_News: https://t.co/zIc8q2bP8bI’m grateful for the tireless work of our local officials, law enforcement, &amp; health care professionals to combat the opioid crisis. Serenity House in Concord is a great example of that and a beacon of hope for people struggling with addiction. https://t.co/efNQK4lAvvAs a member of the @HelsinkiComm, I fully support the @WhiteHouse's actions in response to Russia’s brazen act in the UK. Moscow needs to hear the message loud &amp; clear that such activity will have real consequences. https://t.co/O5G5UzHi2hFort Bragg’s Congressman Richard Hudson says he’s listening. “We hear about the wait times for folks just to get in to have the care. So to me it’s loud and clear that veterans need more flexibility to choose their provider.”

@WNCN: https://t.co/i98etZSMRp"This bureaucracy is not going to get fixed unless Congress makes it get fixed, &amp; we're working really hard on doing that," said Rep. Hudson.
