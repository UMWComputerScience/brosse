I support a pathway to citizenship coupled with immigration reform and heightened border security.I look forward to working with the President on treatment for opioid addiction, updated infrastructure, and better technical education - all of which directly impact rural America and Arkansas’ 1st. #SOTUAs important as what our government has achieved this past year is what we hope to achieve together in the coming months. #SOTUTonight President Trump outlined his first year in office, marked by reasonable deregulation and a historic tax reform package that has unleashed the economy across America, and Arkansas is no exception. #SOTUActually, Dreamers aren’t Americans, but they could be if you supported holistic immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship and increased border security. https://t.co/kmPOteg64ZThe best way to break socialism in Cuba is to encourage Cuban entrepreneurs and engage them economically, starting with agriculture trade. Without US leadership in that country, bad actors move in. #SOTU #FeedEmFreedomPleased that @POTUS is addressing the opioid epidemic that hits rural America hardest. #SOTUA path to citizenship for #DACA recipients must include increased border security. Thankful for the leadership @POTUS has shown in bringing forward a more holistic approach to immigration reform. #SOTUWe have done a disservice to a generation of Americans by pushing all of them to college, regardless of what works well for them. Let’s give just as much support to students seeking education through technical programs and community colleges #SOTUReforming our immigration policy is vital to our country's national security. #SOTU #SafeStrongProudRural America deserves an updated infrastructure to allow us to compete on the global stage. Rail, water, and port infrastructure is critical to the rural economy #SOTUTrade is essential to farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers - I look forward to working on the policies that will support each of these groups in the upcoming #FarmBill #SafeStrongProudOur troops, police force, and veterans deserve our utmost respect. #SOTUThe individual mandate, a tax that disproportionately affected our nation’s poor, is now gone. #SOTULow unemployment and wage growth happen when we allow the American people to invest in themselves instead of the federal government. #TaxReform #SOTU#TaxReform and reasonable deregulation has unleashed our economy. Small businesses, farmers, and teachers in my district are seeing a positive change to their bottom line. #SOTUS #RuralAmericaThe Committee has also voted to allow the Democrats to make their own memo available to all House members, which would follow the same procedure used for the Republican memo.Today I voted to release the FISA memo publicly.
