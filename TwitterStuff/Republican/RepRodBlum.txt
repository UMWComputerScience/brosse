They project interest costs on the federal debt to triple over the next 10 years. This will make interest costs as large as national defense expenditures. We need to pass a balanced budget amendment. https://t.co/lZLs2vpLjTGlad to see @OMBPress and Dept Director @Weichert45 working to streamline govt agencies and make more responsive to citizens in our @GOPoversight committee hearing this AM. https://t.co/5RVs0R3UkiA big win for the 4th Amendment today! https://t.co/zKY0rZgRHdThanks to my good friend Ambassador @peterkmec for the update on affairs in Slovakia. https://t.co/BpUE8ZTPRxToday I chaired our @HouseSmallBiz subcommittee hearing to identify how federal regulations impact small farmers across America and in #IA01 https://t.co/kmpnvUluCPI 100% support @RandPaul efforts in this area.

It has been, and will continue to be, one of my priorities to secure funding for the @CityofCRiowa flood wall. https://t.co/emxGjIdGcRWhippin with some Iowa @NationalFFA students! #IA01 https://t.co/jXzXSGWMnXGreat to work with my friend @ChuckGrassley to pass companion bills  in the House and Senate to protect whistleblowers.

You're implying that communicating with our constituents is wasteful spending. Why wasn't your question why we saved more money than any other House office? Maybe because you're biased? https://t.co/HfjfmEYoDOJust asked by @rjfoley @AP why we “waste” government money communicating with our constituents. I am proud to be #1 in the House for devoting resources communicating with my district, while also being #1 in the House in saving the most $ of my office budget ($275,000). https://t.co/y81MvJbfcBThe @iowamotortruck stopped by this afternoon to discuss solutions for worker shortages and other issues impacting the #IA01 trucking industry. https://t.co/6cYSAWyts7Save the date for our upcoming local office hours in June!

UNI does such a good job holding down student debt while providing an excellent academic experience! https://t.co/lZoZKQvtf8Lots of agreement among #IA01 small-business leaders on the good things going on in our economy. Consensus at @NFIB lunch in Cedar Falls was "Keep the government out of the way!" Workforce continues to be number one issue. https://t.co/KjDLmPPnUbThank you to my constituents supported at North Star Community Services for their questions.

Tax cuts are helping this business and many others to expand, need reforms to boost workforce! #IA01 https://t.co/tYPagJHLvuI am so proud of my father’s service in the @USNavy. Thank you to all of those who have served our country, but are no longer with us. Although today is especially for you, we owe the freedoms we enjoy on a daily basis to your sacrifices. #MemorialDay18 https://t.co/IDpaWsrBMrI took this photo during my visit to @ArlingtonNatl a couple weeks ago. This #MemorialDay18 let’s remember all of the warriors who sacrificed their lives for our freedoms, and the families who are still here to honor and carry on their memories. https://t.co/ilcUD1zhs5Very pleased with passage of my amendments through the #NDAA yesterday.

Below’s a small sample of the students I’ve met within the last 2 months. Sad though, often the media is invited and won’t cover me—like @gazettedotcom w/ my last 2 meetings w/ students in Cedar Rapids. https://t.co/lcTA44aYb32/2 @Kevin_Drahos FYI due to the shouting and lack of decorum at town halls last year, feedback has been that tele-town halls (which I’ve spoken to 38,000 of my constituents through this year) are more effective at reaching the most people and sharing my stances on issues. #IA011/2 @Kevin_Drahos, I was surprised to read your LTE in the @gazettedotcom about not meeting with “constituents and students,” when I just signed this follow-up letter from my meeting with you less than a month ago. #IA01 https://t.co/yhUgyrErYAContinuing the fight against partisan gerrymandering with @RepLowenthal &amp; @RepBrianFitz ! #IA01 https://t.co/AIax2tqRoHThanks to the Iowa @NAPATweets for stopping by to discuss the need for infrastructure improvements and solutions to workforce shortages. #IA01 https://t.co/HnGvFt072GShoutout to museums in #IA01 offering free admission to active duty military! @NCSML @vesterheim @DubuqueArt @BlackIowa @RiverMuseum @NFTM @GroutMuseum @WCA_PYP @CedarFalls Historical Society &amp; Cedar Rock State Park &amp; The Granger House Victorian Museum. @NEAarts #BlueStarMuseums https://t.co/t0wcDyReJBInteresting testimony from @JohnCornyn this morning in our @GOPoversight hearing to discuss sustainable solutions to the evolving opioid crisis. #IA01 https://t.co/XLFcS98gRmJoin my staff in Decorah next week! #IA01 https://t.co/vjplm33FL1This morning, over 100 veterans from across northeast Iowa stopped by the WWII memorial in Washington, DC.
