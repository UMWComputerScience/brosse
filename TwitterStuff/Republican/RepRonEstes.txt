I was honored to attend the homecoming reception for Kansas’ own @MissTeenUSA @HaileyColborn. Hailey is an inspiration to young women, and I wish her well on the year ahead and whatever opportunities come next! https://t.co/mxoyzv4CquI was proud to support today's Defense spending bill to continue rebuilding our military. This bill funds the largest troop pay raise in 9 years. It's a win for #KS04 and the Airmen at @22ARW by funding new equipment, including 15 KC-46 tankers. https://t.co/pqUCris0TcI've supported measures to fix our immigration system, secure our borders, build a wall &amp; provide stability to DACA recipients. Today’s bill addressed some of those pillars, but I could not support amnesty for those in our country illegally. Statement: https://t.co/jTTNeM9EXFThe images of damage from the Eureka tornado are heartbreaking. Praying for those injured and all those working to restore power &amp; clean debris. When a disaster strikes, Kansans come together to help each other. With dangerous heat expected today, please check on your neighbors.I spoke on the House floor to offer thoughts &amp; prayers to St. Joseph Catholic Church in Andale &amp; firefighters injured responding to Sunday's fire. I'm confident our community will continue to join together to help St. Joseph’s in the difficult task of rebuilding their church. https://t.co/xEHGah9RUfI was humbled to request Father Dan Spexarth of St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church in Wichita to serve as the guest chaplain today for the House of Representatives and introduce him to @SpeakerRyan. https://t.co/0J4Ykml967 https://t.co/3GoFKjZGUePlease pray for the firefighters who bravely responded to a fire at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Andale yesterday.

We need solutions that secure our border, close loopholes, &amp; provide stability to DACA recipients without providing amnesty or incentivizing breaking the law. https://t.co/oS0JYluu5xThe needed &amp; overdue delivery of #KC46 tankers is great news for our country, and I'm proud @22ARW is slated to receive the first round.

As a strong advocate of free &amp; fair trade, I will continue working to ensure any trade negotiations produce favorable outcomes for KS manufacturers &amp; farmers.While I support the president’s overall strong posture on trade negotiations, today’s tariffs on steel &amp; aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the EU are disappointing. Retaliation from these tariffs puts Kansas manufacturers and farmers who rely on aluminum &amp; steel at risk.
