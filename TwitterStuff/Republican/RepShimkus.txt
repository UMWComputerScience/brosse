Statement from @RodneyDavis @RepBost @RepKinzinger @RepHultgren @RepLaHood and me: https://t.co/2Ii7x8NgdwDemocrats are threatening a government shutdown over deadlines that don’t exist. https://t.co/WaFVS09rdXThe House DID fully fund #CHIP months ago -- November 3 to be exact. 

Most Democrats voted against it then too. https://t.co/MTnZkF1EpUSenate Democrats are bragging that they have the votes to filibuster funding for #CHIP. It’s time for them to do their job and protect 325,990 Illinois kids who need that coverage. https://t.co/vNCkcUwReyExodus 24:7 Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people, and they said, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”Exodus 18:10 So Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharoah, and who delivered the people from the hand of the Egyptians.”If Senate Democrats filibuster the continuing resolution, any resulting shutdown will be on their hands.

I will vote FOR the continuing resolution, FOR six years of funding for CHIP, and FOR the resources and raise our troops deserve. https://t.co/1UwPSql0M2Will the federal government shut down? @MarkReardonKMOX and I will talk about it shortly on KMOX. Tune-in here: https://t.co/HM8NZzQzZvThe continuing resolution keeps the government open, funds #CHIP for 6 years, and gets our military men and women the resources and raise they need. It has my support. https://t.co/PXOuTlKV87Why is today’s hearing important? 

Because evaluating contamination and determining the appropriate remedy for Superfund sites can take years or even decades, delaying cleanups and preventing these areas from being returned to productive use. https://t.co/Gv7kJx3BMvICYMI -&gt; Apple's repatriation and investment plans are expected to create 20,000 new jobs in the United States.
https://t.co/Hcf1jtqoU1Government is shrinking, the economy is growing, federal taxes are decreasing, and more Americans are optimistic about the future. https://t.co/JKkdSTv2KFExodus 14:26 Then The Lord said to Moses, “Stretch our your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen.”An important history lesson from my former House colleague, @SenatorLankford, on this National Religious Freedom Day. https://t.co/kop3aPXydrThe reality is 78 percent of full-time workers report living paycheck to paycheck. For most Americans, an extra $500 or $1000 is a real help. https://t.co/YtOC5qiOwPGreat news! "The economic and political impacts of soaring U.S. output are breathtaking, cutting the nation’s oil imports by a fifth over a decade, providing high-paying jobs in rural communities and lowering consumer prices for domestic gasoline by 37 percent from a 2008 peak." https://t.co/JQbUR7WPKhAfter Title II #NetNeutralty rules were put in place, investment in broadband deployment actually decreased. That's bad for the unserved and underserved communities I represent. 

There's a better way: https://t.co/WjLVo2Z6L3 https://t.co/AalhRZzQftWhy is this important?

All but 15 @HouseDemocrats voted against that critical funding, jeopardizing care for more than 8 million low-income children. https://t.co/n5esyN7IXuIt's true: 90 percent of my constituents in #IL15 will be able to take a nearly doubled standard deduction and file on a form as simple as a postcard. https://t.co/5Qdaa5yV9PGreat to see @USDA &amp; @SecretarySonny prioritizing rural Americans access to broadband! https://t.co/8sUpKaru1VExcellent news!

How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?”Genesis 38:26 Juda recognized them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shela.” And he did not have relations with her again.Genesis 36:11 God also said to him, “I am God Almighty; Be fruitful and multiply; A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, And kings shall come forth from you.”You worked hard for your paycheck, and soon you'll get to keep more of what you earned. https://t.co/6azy6REJj4Genesis 32:28 He said, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with man and have prevailed.”You can see which Members of Congress voted for community health centers and CHIP, and which Members voted against funding those critical programs here https://t.co/C8a9RNZ6oxEvery Illinois Republican voted on November 3 to fund community health centers, like this one, for 2 years. 

All but 15 Democrats voted AGAINST that funding, which is essential to care for 1 in 13 people nationwide. https://t.co/YwK2J2habzIt's only been the law for 2 weeks, but already +100 American companies are paying +500,000 workers more as a result of the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act.

And it’s just the beginning. https://t.co/stCRRbcwPkThere has been a lot of misinformation pushed by opponents of tax reform. Some folks even think they’ll be paying more when the reality is they’ll be paying less. Ultimately, the proof that we got it right for the American people will be in their paychecks next year.Fixing the business side of our tax code is a win for workers and job creators alike, but individual taxpayers and families at every income level will also get to keep more of their paychecks under this new tax code.I’ve pushed for and promoted a simpler, fairer, flatter tax code since I was first elected, and that’s exactly what I was proud to vote for today.Ezekiel 34:11 For thus says the Lord God, “Behold, I Myself will search for my sheep and seek them out.”This bill DOES make the standard deduction $24,000 for married filers.
