So fun last night with the Lampeter-Strasburg girls softball team celebrating their state championship with the community! They‚Äôve got an amazing support base of fans. https://t.co/IouZ0jAC1oSimply put, the House has now missed two opportunities to fix our broken immigration system and make our country more safe, secure, and prosperous. The American people deserve better than the failed status quo. https://t.co/ucw05tgN6YThe legislation offered by Chairman Bob Goodlatte that failed in the House last week ‚Äì Securing America‚Äôs Future Act ‚Äì was a great opportunity reform our immigration system. That‚Äôs why I voted for it. https://t.co/ucw05tgN6YThis legislation also missed an opportunity to make needed reforms to our agricultural immigrant labor programs, make E-Verify law of the land, and address the vast worker shortage found in Pennsylvania and across the country. https://t.co/ucw05tgN6YThe bill does not hold sanctuary cities accountable for protecting dangerous criminals, nor does it crack down on individuals overstaying their visa. These are two critical priorities that must be addressed. https://t.co/ucw05tgN6YOur badly-broken immigration system must be fixed, but the legislation before the House today was not the solution. https://t.co/XAqIIBDjlWTONIGHT: I'm hosting my next telephone town hall with a special guest!

But there's more... https://t.co/BYlnJ3f211Hundreds of thousands of rape kits remain untested in the United States - leaving sexual assault victims without the justice they deserve.

Once her wagon was full, she traveled to the makeshift hospitals tending to wounded soldiers from the battle. #WomensHistoryMonthLydia Hamilton Smith was an African-American woman who became the partner and confidant of Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens during the civil war and the ensuing debate and passage of the 13th Amendment. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/ojXJEadwEHGreat meeting today in my DC office with representatives from the Brain Injury Association of Pennsylvania.
