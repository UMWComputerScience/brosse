Calvin Coolidge, 1923
First televised? Harry Truman, 1947
First webcast? George Bush, 2002
#SOTUWithSteveThomas Jefferson never gave a #SOTU speech; he preferred to send his updates to Congress in written form. #SOTUWithSteveThe Constitution says that presidents must update Congress on the SOTU, but it doesn't say that it must be a speech. #SOTUWithSteveFun fact: a president's first speech to Congress isn't called a State of the Union, it's just an Address to a #JointSession. #SOTUWithSteveHappy #InternationalPolarBearDay  to our furry friends at the @ColumbusZoo.
