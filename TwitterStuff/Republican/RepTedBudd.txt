Great to stop by Nelson Royals in Mooresville today with my daughter, Macy. This local store has been in business for over 50 years now. Still going strong as a local family run business here in #NC13 https://t.co/HNqWObobgrI enjoyed my time last night at the annual Davidson County Farm Bureau Board of Directors Picnic at Center Hill Baptist Church. The Farm Bureau does important work right here in #NC13. Thanks for having me. https://t.co/qJJTSeOsDyAnother successful tax reform story from Environmental Air Solutions in High Point and Guilford County. Because of tax reform, EAS decided to buy their building instead of lease. They’ve also hired more than 300 new employees this year alone and are still hiring. https://t.co/1p0anQ7EIDIn a time  where premium increases have become a norm, this bill would provide cheaper options for those who want them. @WXII @myfox8 @HPEnterprise @NewsandRecord @SpecNewsTriadYesterday, I introduced the Improving Choices in Health Care Act. It’s a simple bill that would strengthen short term, limited duration health plans so people in our state and around the country would have a viable option for health insurance coverage. https://t.co/Dkde4tB1SEI voted in favor of H. Res. 970. Congress shouldn’t have to beg anyone in the Department of Justice to turn over documents to the Legislative Branch. The DOJ has so far failed to comply with requests for information from 2 separate House committees. https://t.co/6tvUSsp6t8Congratulations once again to our Congressional Art Competition winner representing #NC13. Jacob’s “Bike with Tree” will hang in the U.S. Capitol until next summer. https://t.co/N3lkBxI56GNumbers don't lie, the #GOP tax cuts are working. The National Association of Manufacturers numbers show that 93% of manufacturers have a positive outlook, 86% plan to increase investments and 77% plan to increase hiring. Manufacturers credit tax reform as the reason why. https://t.co/uUIA7U5M9uSTARTING SHORTLY: @FinancialCmte hearing with @SecretaryCarson dealing with oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Watch live: https://t.co/m9Pg8JBs37 https://t.co/CsGtNI3o78Earlier today I sat down with Mark Robinson and his wife. Mark and I connected over our passion to protect the second amendment.

We were joined by Davidson County Commissioners Zak Crotts, Steve Jarvis and Steve Shell. The Epilepsy Ass. advocates, supports and educates those dealing with epilepsy. https://t.co/yChbIQfUppI visited Novant Health Rowan Medical Center today. I met with their team and long time hospital president, Dari Caldwell, who shared with me their on-going initiatives and health challenges for #NC13. We are grateful to have such a great team serving our area. https://t.co/yi6RKdYTvxI Spent the early part of the day getting my REAL ID in Lexington with other Davidson County officials. By 2020, REAL ID’s will be the standalone ID Document. Although 2020 seems far off, I want to encourage all #NC13 residents to get their REAL ID to eliminate DMV backlog. https://t.co/WJsGPKndYUMy family and I enjoyed being at Cornerstone Church in Salisbury this past Sunday to commemorate their 15th annual Celebrate America Service. We were honored to be a part of this special day. https://t.co/R47lHSvlGEThanks to the #GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 90% of Americans will see more money in their paychecks. Six months in and we are already seeing: 
✅ More Jobs 
✅ Bigger Paychecks 
✅ Fairer Taxes 
For more information, Visit: https://t.co/VE7W9tibho https://t.co/MMxxBGNvalToday, the House passed the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act will help in our overall efforts to combat the #opioidcrisis. For more information, visit https://t.co/UEspYLkseW.Today marks 6 months since the #GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been enacted. People across #NC13 are seeing bigger paychecks, lower utility bills and thousands of workers have received bonuses. Unemployment is at its lowest level in nearly 20 years and we are just getting started! https://t.co/yJixQm13OaCongratulations to the Congressional Award Gold Medalists representing #NC13. These @theaward winners have put in countless hours of voluntary public service, physical fitness, and personal development to earn this prestigious honor. https://t.co/wFN4SNgLqaI asked our witnesses about the increasing use of virtual currencies specifically by Islamic radicals and for specifics on what the counter-terrorism community is doing to combat this change in terrorist financing.I sit on the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee of House Financial Services, and yesterday, we held a hearing discussing ways to combat the illicit use of virtual currencies. Representatives from Homeland Security, the Secret Service, and FinCEN testified. @FinancialCmte https://t.co/ik88c7X6ZaMore good news --&gt;"Low jobless claims are a good sign. They suggest that layoffs are infrequent...the average total number of people receiving benefits, available for up to 26 weeks in most states, has fallen to the lowest level in over 44 years." https://t.co/K13OEUWD1VI was also pleased to recently join the @HBCUCaucus to put me in a better position to fight for HBCUs in Washington.I also appreciate Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Lomax for joining me. HBCU’s are important to me, #NC13, and they have a major impact on our local economy. I enjoyed discussing with Dr. Bennett this morning just how much of a positive impact they have in Greensboro alone.We discussed the implementation of bipartisan language myself, @RepAdams, and @BobbyScott were able to get in the recent omnibus benefiting the HBCU Capital Finance Program. I appreciate the time Secretary DeVos gave us this morning.Earlier today, I had the opportunity to meet with Secretary of Education @BetsyDeVosED , along with Dr. Phyllis Dawkins, President of @BennettCollege , and Dr. Michael Lomax, President of the @UNCF. https://t.co/eR98T20tXVCongress has the power to legislate → not the president.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort and getting this issue fixed as soon as possible.I said this earlier this week, but it bears repeating. I do not support separating minor children from their parents at our border and this legislation would fix this issue. For years now, the laws on how to handle children of illegal immigrants have been vague.One thing it would do is clarify the Flores Settlement of ‘97 so that children of illegal immigrants who are apprehended at the southern border are not separated from their parent or legal guardian while in custody of the Department of Homeland Security.I am now a cosponsor of the Equal Protection of Unaccompanied Minors Act led by @RepMarkMeadows. This bill would take many steps to ensure families who cross our border illegally aren’t separated.The opioid epidemic has affected people in my district, in North Carolina, and around the entire country. Over the past couple of weeks, the House has taken up different measures aimed at addressing this crisis. Today, the #COACHAct passed the House.  https://t.co/eFVbhzCucOThe Generating American Income and Infrastructure Act will help low income communities while reducing the debt at the same time. I am happy to join this bipartisan effort with my colleague’s @MikeKellyPA and Rep. William Clay. #GAIINAct https://t.co/25jKei7EpeMy statement regarding current policy of separating families at the U.S. border: https://t.co/SqvoGRL1wi"Economic confidence among lower-income Americans has taken a recent leap, the latest evidence that benefits of the economic expansion are reaching a broader swath of workers." Economic confidence rises among lower-income Americans https://t.co/j9gwqGQRPWThe numbers are clear, since the enactment of the #GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have seen 1 million new jobs created.

https://t.co/h9Nq5A2ZDM https://t.co/6h5kUT3TZ3I was happy to co-sponsor the THRIVE Act from my friend @RepAndyBarr.

Thank you all for your service to this country. https://t.co/8ZA3OT4yhkH.R. 5227 is simple, but necessary piece of legislation. It would call on the Treasury Department to develop a national strategy to identify and combat terror and other illicit use of virtual currencies. It’s a step in the right direction.And this of course increasingly means using virtual currencies. So, we in Congress are in a tough spot, we have to figure out a way to keep this nascent industry from being regulated to death while also coming up with ways to combat illicit use.Today, I co-sponsored HR 5227, the Preventing Rogue and Foreign Actors from Evading Sanctions Act. through my work on the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee, I’ve seen first hand how terrorists and other illicit actors use new and innovative ways to bypass sanctions.The #opioidcrisis has been wreaking havoc on communities in #NC13 for far too long. In 2016 alone, we lost nearly 2,000 North Carolinians to this epidemic. This week, the House #GOP is moving legislation to reverse this trend. https://t.co/ipIu1vdl5aWe’re committed to combating the #opioidcrisis and that can only be done through...
✓ Treatment and recovery
✓ Prevention
✓ Protecting communities
✓ Fighting fentanyl

Duty, Honor, Country. @WestPoint_USMA https://t.co/dHPFwhQzUlEarlier in @FinancialCmte markup, @RepSeanDuffy passionately defended his bill HR 3861 and the state based insurance regulation model. The Federal Insurance Office, created by an obscure section of Dodd-Frank, is potentially a seed of the state based system’s destruction.I commend @MickMulvaneyOMB and @realDonaldTrump for their leadership on this issue. For the sake of hard-working taxpayers in NC &amp; around the country, we shouldn't let unspent money from previous years just sit in accounts. Let this be the first of MANY more rescission packages!Tonight, I will cast my vote in favor of H.R. 3 - the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act. Through this rescissions package, I hope we can cut billions of dollars in unnecessary spending. This will be the largest rescissions package in our country's history.Small business workers are seeing the highest level of compensation increases in nearly 20 years.

These are actions all Americans can be proud of! https://t.co/hA6aCQOaRFSo, let’s use #NationalDoughnutDay to highlight this iconic brands contribution to our economy and their positive impact in the community while also enjoying a hot doughnut a cup of coffee. https://t.co/hmRGuuk0RdThere are some other things worth noting about the company. For example, with over 1,000 locations and 4,000 employees, they are a strong and stable employer in our state, region, and country.Today is #NationalDoughnutDay! I’ll be celebrating with a dozen “Hot Now” from Krispy Kreme! While all North Carolinians know Krispy Kreme is superior to other doughnuts based on their taste, texture, and sugary glaze.I spent the early part of today with @SecretaryCarson for HUD’s Protect Our Kids event in #Greensboro for Health Homes Month. During a roundtable discussions with HUD leaders and local officials we discussed best practices to continue to protect our children from housing hazards. https://t.co/qQgPI6W5UAI spoke this morning at the North Carolinians for Home Education conference.

That means making sure we utilize every tool in our toolkit to stop them.Our language also calls for specifics on US efforts to address and end these mechanisms. Islamic terrorists like ISIS, and their affiliates in the region, continue to evolve and adopt more sophisticated means to fund their terror operations.My amendment to the 2019 NDAA, that I introduced with my friends @RepSinema and @RepBrianFitz, has passed the House. We are calling for a detailed report on how the Islamic State is leveraging different financing mechanisms to fund their terrorist activity.Congratulations Jacob!

Balancing our budget and cutting spending will continue to be one of my top priorities.For decades the U.S. has, in theory, regarded #Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.

Today’s action by the @realDonaldTrump shows strength and signals to the world that we are serious about denuclearization.To understand why @realDonaldTrump has decided to pull out of the Iran deal, it’s important to remember how we got to this point in the first place. In 2015, President Obama/Secretary Kerry withstood bipartisan opposition from Congress and struck a deal with the Iranian regime.I am supportive of @realDonaldTrump decision today. To stay in this deal would not only be turning a blind eye to misbehavior, but it would be dismissing it in such a way that could lead to grave consequences. https://t.co/L4BkpMOOZWBUDD SUPPORTS PRESIDENT TRUMP’S DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM IRAN DEAL - https://t.co/IUHaTblT9gThank you, @realDonaldTrump for your leadership on this: Budd Statement on President Trump’s FEMA Disaster Relief Declaration for North Carolina - https://t.co/kqJX18he5WI am joining the Billy Buck Morning Show tomorrow at 7:45 AM on #WAME 92.9 FM or 550 AM.

Congress said no more in 2011 after major criminal abuses of the process, but there's an ongoing effort to bring them back.  The Earmark Elimination Act would stop these efforts, permanently. https://t.co/zbRYmxusXtCouldn't agree more @RepRalphNorman.  Earmarks will not help Washington's dysfunction--they will make it worse.  People who say that they will make legislating easier are wrong. https://t.co/xzoFbRpk4jI've worked with @repjimcooper @repkathleenrice and @repralphnorman to introduce the Earmark Elimination Act, a bill that would ban pork-barrel spending permanently.

https://t.co/hgdok5UEkT.@POTUS is absolutely right to fight Gateway project, as I did last year with an amendment to cut off its funding.
