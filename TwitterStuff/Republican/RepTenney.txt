https://t.co/6tTv6Jh9gCLive on @FoxBusiness now!https://t.co/xFnk1eOySwOne of the greatest Presidents in U.S. history was born 107 years ago today. Happy Birthday to the man who served as our 40th President, Ronald Reagan. https://t.co/sMu3N0BBQQI spoke with @CNN this morning about the upcoming March 8 deadline to pass the CR. The importance of predictability and funding, especially for our defense is vital. I hope the Democrats will come to the table and work with Republicans to come up with a bipartisan solution. https://t.co/VXPIFwO8kjTune in now to @CNN to watch me discuss the Continuing Resolution and the FISA Memo.This morning I sat down with @WCNY.  We spoke about landmark legislation passed by Congress this year to ensure that no person, family, or community is left behind. https://t.co/fObAml1yy1Do you need help with a federal agency?

https://t.co/ppwvJEDd30I'm confident that 2018 will be another banner year as we confront our challenges &amp; make the most of our opportunities. I'll continue to fight to make sure that this American comeback reaches every corner of These United States, especially Central New York and the Southern Tier.Last night, @POTUS made an impressive case for a great American comeback. We are stronger, freer, and safer than we were just a year ago.I drove up with my son and was not on the train. I am praying for everyone involved.ICYMI: My reaction to last night's #SOTU https://t.co/YBUWGpj522Thank you @POTUS. There has never been a better time to start living the American dream #SOTUOpioid addiction is rampant in our country. I’m happy to hear @POTUS is fiercely commited to fighting this epidemic #SOTU@POTUS is right. It’s time we establish comprehensive immigration reform. #SOTUI agree with @POTUS. We must protect American workers and American intellectual property through enforcement of our trade rules #SOTUOur men and women in uniform dedicate their lives to defend our great nation.

https://t.co/qyGW3AT9UsIt’s an honor to be joined by my son, Captain Wayne Cleary, @USMC, at @POTUS first #SOTU address. It is an inspiration to represent so many veterans in our community who have answered the noble call to serve this great nation. https://t.co/Stns6qsIvL#MedicaidDSH payments allow hospitals nationwide to treat our most vulnerable Americans.  Cuts to DSH must be delayed to ensure New Yorkers can access safety net hospitals when in need. 

https://t.co/q0RgAgdItJYesterday, I toured Crescent Commons construction site in Cortland County, NY. I was successful in securing the historic tax credit to ensure community revitalization projects like this can continue in communities in Upstate New York. https://t.co/dFsn3S5fx4Yesterday, I had the privilege to speak with Kristi. Kristi is a veteran of the U.S. Army and also, a core runner for the last two years in the New York Run for the Fallen. This will be her 3rd year participating. Her service and dedication to our country is truly inspiring. https://t.co/6l4msAQ7yLIn February, 90 % of Americans will see a bigger paycheck. Make sure you #CheckYourPaycheck. 

https://t.co/oHlxgCtQDBYesterday, Delhi and I stopped by the Stevens-Swan Humane Society Telethon. In an effort to put an end to animal cruelty and protect our furry companions, I have cosponsored the Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act of 2017, the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act and the PACE Act. https://t.co/4wxmsPpoz7The political miscalculation by Senate Minority Leader Schumer was despicable and a reckless way to govern. Had the Democrats put their self-serving agendas aside, this unnecessary shutdown could have been completely avoided.This unnecessary shutdown shines a light on Democrats’ stunning hypocrisies, as all of the initiatives in the CR have been supported by the Democrats for years.#SchumerShutdown has ended. Sen. Schumer’s ill-conceived attempt to leverage vital funding for active duty military personnel, needy children, seniors and flood victims to protect illegal immigrants failed miserably with the renewal of the CR passed today in the House and Senate.I've requested to have my pay withheld until Congress reaches a deal to open the government. For each day the government is shutdown, I will donate my net pay to an organization in #NY22 impacted by the shutdown. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/JXKHtUVEHzJoining @MSNBC next on day two of the #SchumersShutdown https://t.co/Ljsuwcbm4WUntil Congress reaches a deal to fund the government, I've pledged to withhold my salary. If Congress fails to do its job they too should forfeit their compensation. I've also introduced No Work, No Pay Act which would require Congress to forfeit pay each day of the shut down. https://t.co/DDJjCyUD9KYesterday I introduced the No Work, No Pay Act of 2018 which would require Members of Congress to forfeit their pay each day the government remains shut down. If Congress fails to do its job they too should forfeit their compensation. #SchumerShutdownHere's what's at stake during the #SchumerShutdown: 9 million children will lose their health insurance, this denied access could cause potentially life threatening removal of treatment. Call Sen. Schumer's office and tell him to do the right thing. https://t.co/6RmRaowL50By forcing an unnecessary government shutdown, Democrats once again showed that they are willing to use military families, children’s health insurance, veteran's healthcare, seniors and flood victims as political weapons. It is irresponsible and reckless. https://t.co/ctjVrjT7rcToday I attended the 45th annual #MarchforLife.  Every life is a precious gift.  Thank you to all who stand up to defend our future generations. #WhyWeMarch #prolife https://t.co/1Y49c6mnzHThis morning I spoke with @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness about our fight to avoid a government shutdown. It’s despicable that Senate Democrats are using CHIP, the National Flood Insurance Program and our military as political hostages. https://t.co/95r6UJgx9mShutting down the government would put men &amp; women in uniform at risk, jeopardize national security and threaten readiness capabilities. It’s despicable that Democrats led by @SenSchumer are using children’s health care &amp; military personnel as political hostages #SchumerShutdownI am a cosponsor of this bill. It provides a common sense, compassionate solution to fix our broken immigration system. We should bring this to the floor for a vote. https://t.co/T27y4Qlt9MI'll be on #TalkoftheTown tomorrow morning at 7:30am to talk about funding the federal government, weekend flooding in the Mohawk Valley, legislation we're working on to reform FEMA and Governor Cuomo's budget proposal.

Our law enforcement officers work day and night to keep our families and communities safe, often without thanks. https://t.co/EVLIQaJQQVI had a productive day yesterday visiting local businesses with the @BingChamber to speak about legislation Congress passed in 2017 to ease the burden on businesses so they can continue to invest in their workforce and what they'd like to see Congress tackle in 2018. https://t.co/kGb9Qyn3DYThis is great news for employees across the country. #TaxReform is already leading to real investments in the American workforce, our communities and charities. https://t.co/DIUUrcSAY1 via @dcexaminerInstead of playing partisan political games like the governor, I’ve stood up for NYers by helping to pass landmark legislation to soften the blow of Albany’s harmful agenda. @NYGovCuomo continues to put his personal aspirations above the needs of NYers. https://t.co/wF3o7a44TgIt is disheartening to see the Iranian regime continue to brutalize its own people who are speaking out for freedom and human rights. The United States and the international community must stand strong with those advocating for freedom in the #Iranprotests#HappyNewYear! Wishing everyone a happy, healthy and blessed 2018. https://t.co/mVmg1vevuNAnyone traveling in Oswego County please be careful.

Tune into @FoxBusiness to watch. https://t.co/JdnEAaeXHJAny Congress member or staff member leaking this type of information to the media should no longer be involved in the investigation. This violates the rules and should be investigated immediately. https://t.co/QA1gcGLOOXThe status-quo has failed, but this changes today. Tax reform will provide significant relief on the federal level. Now, it's time for Albany to get it's fiscal house in order and stop their out-of-control spending to provide even more relief by lowering state taxes. https://t.co/Cdgc0nua3XIt was an honor to work alongside @SenatorTimScott, @IvankaTrump, Senator @marcorubio and many others to help hardworking families across the nation. Our efforts were successful in doubling the Child Tax Credit in the final bill! https://t.co/xFOZnhRqaLToday we're providing critical relief to hardworking families across the country, while ensuring our job creators can compete on a level playing field. https://t.co/vTxtKJ4wkDI'll be up next on @MSNBC to talk about the middle-class tax cut the House just sent to the President's desk. #NY22 https://t.co/6XlC06HMrEThe #TaxCutAndJobsAct is going to provide once in a generation relief for millions of Americans.

Tune in to watch the interview. #NY22 https://t.co/AL3eOSr27SIt was an honor to join the Rome-Utica Chapter of the Military Officers Association and Proctor Navy ROTC students at St. Peter's Cemetery in Rome on Saturday as we paid tribute and remembered our fallen veterans on #WreathsAcrossAmerica day. https://t.co/khH2V3KL37The train derailment in Washington State is a terrible tragedy. We mourn for all the lives lost and continue to keep our friends in Washington State in our thoughts. https://t.co/BPPPeOEQck#HappyHanukkah This important holiday, stemming from the Maccabees'  fight for liberty long ago, is a strong reminder of the value of freedom and the sacrifices made for this ideal throughout history.PASSED- Today the House passed my bill the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act with Strong Bipartisan support. #NY22 https://t.co/cl9YgQh2fBRegulations like these are the reason that America continues to lose one community bank per day on average. It's time to roll back regulations so our community institutions can become active in  residential mortgage lending once again and help our rural, underserved areas thrive.With smaller staffs &amp; less resources than large financial institutions, local institutions are unable to bear the regulatory burden that my bill would roll back. These regulations have driven local institutions out of the mortgage lending market, hurting our local communities.The Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act will alleviate harmful burdens that drive our small community institutions out of the mortgage lending market. It will also roll back regulations that have doubled the cost of servicing loans for low-income borrowers.Tune into @cspan to watch the debate on my bill the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act H.R.3971. My bill will be on the floor today for a vote #NY22 https://t.co/KxKfuMmjS7Thank you to our brave first responders especially the #NYPD and #FDNY who acted swiftly this morning at the #PortAuthority. We are grateful for your work today and everyday to keep us safe.I'm calling on Gov. Cuomo to immediately appeal FEMA's decision to deny a major disaster declaration. I'm also inviting FEMA Administrator Brock Long to tour damaged areas and meet with those who were impacted by the devastating flooding. https://t.co/rZHOyE1aw2
