Justice Stras is deserving of this post, and I am glad to see his nomination move forward.Today, Congress has the opportunity to expand, not the law, but rather, and instead, the number of Americans who can own a own home, or start their own business. #HMDAACFPB‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble the data‚Äù rule is not just ineffective and costly, it also poses a threat to Americans‚Äô privacy and data security. We must pass #HMDAA to give relief to Main Street banks and credit unions in Minnesota and across the country.Due to the increased cost of compliance with the CFPB‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble the data‚Äù rule ‚Äì an estimated additional $326 million - many small banks in Minnesota are reconsidering their ability to continue to make mortgages and other covered loans. #HMDAAOver the years the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act has expanded away from its original intent (to eliminate discriminatory lending). Dodd-Frank‚Äôs CFPB created a rule in 2015 to move it even further - requiring more than DOUBLE the data required to be reported. #HMDAASome laws have proven helpful to Americans who want a chance at the American Dream. Others have created obstacles by codifying government overreach. #HMDAANOW: Tune in to listen on why America needs #HMDAA: https://t.co/ZWOIH3B6PsCOMING UP: I‚Äôm speaking on the House floor ahead of tonight's vote on my Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act. #HMDAA Stay tuned‚Ä¶Had a great time catching up with the entire Minnesota delegation today over lunch!
