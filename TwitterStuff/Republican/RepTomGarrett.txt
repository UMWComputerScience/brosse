Watch our @facebooklive HERE → https://t.co/QsAmUBp3cf https://t.co/O1yVyAMsOP.@SenSchumer, your reckless government #shutdown has gone on long enough. It's time for you and your @SenateDems colleagues to do the right thing and #saveCHIP, protect #seniors, fund the #military and open this government back up. https://t.co/dHbAK4q2EK#SchumerShutdown Day 3: It's time for @SenateDems to do the right thing and #saveCHIP, protect #seniors, fund the #military and open this government back up. https://t.co/WUtEdbTLW2OPEN FOR BUSINESS: Despite the #SchumerShutdown, our offices in Charlottesville, Danville, and Washington D.C. remain open to serve the needs to #VA05.

Watch our latest HERE → https://t.co/dP5x25Ae3I https://t.co/2zJEO5YuhXLast night @HouseDemocrats voted to keep the government closed and @SenateDems won't take ownership of this reckless #SchumerShutdown. @SenSchumer, why have you left servicemembers, seniors and sick kids in the lunch? Watch our @facebooklive HERE → https://t.co/dP5x25Ae3I https://t.co/cv6RuZbLKo#SchumerShutdown Day 2: 93% of all @HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems voted to shut down the government, leaving seniors, servicemembers, and sick kids in the lurch. It's time to reopen the government, #SaveCHIP, and get back to work for the American people. https://t.co/4D3aCk2nK5Shameful that 93% of @HouseDemocrats and @senatedems voted for this Schumer-Pelosi shipwreck. Time for them to take ownership of their disastrous game. Glad to be working with @RepByrne to protect sick kids, support seniors, and ensure military paychecks. https://t.co/L4qw3ZmSj3
