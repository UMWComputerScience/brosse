Great to meet with #GA14 students (including my son, John!) who were in the D.C. area yesterday for @FBLA_National competition. https://t.co/dcr865j20uThis bipartisan bill is critical for @POTUS plan to rebuild the military. Building off last year's progress, it makes historic investments to ensure military readiness, includes well-deserved pay raise for troops &amp; boosts GA’s contribution to nat'l defense https://t.co/oINxYf5phGEnjoyed lunch w/ @POTUS today discussing Approps. Including the spirited debate w/ Senate colleagues when I brought up their archaic 60-vote requirement. #MakeAppropriationsWorkAgain #NoMoreOmnis #FiscalResponsibility @realDonaldTrumpCongrats @JeffFortenberry on the new chairmanship of Legislative Branch Subcommittee on @HouseAppropsGOP! As an alumni, I can say it’s an important job for our great institution (&amp; for the kids who can now sled on Capitol Hill)!This week, the House built on the progress we made last week in addressing the opioid epidemic, which kills more than 115 Americans every day. Bipartisan bills we passed enhance prescription drug monitoring programs &amp; improve access to federal resources. https://t.co/qTCLZvzSvgWith 6.6M job openings in March, the changes in #FarmBill will help more people leave welfare &amp; achieve the dignity and purpose that comes with work. Importantly, no one will lose benefits under these reforms unless they decline to work or accept free job training. 4/4Additionally, the #FarmBill builds on the reforms we made in 2013 to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. It ensures families facing financial challenges get assistance while enhancing work and training requirements for able-bodied adults. 3/#FarmBill strengthens the programs that protect &amp; support the Georgians who work hard every day to put food on our tables. It also cuts and streamlines regulations to make sure our farmers &amp; ranchers are competitive in the global marketplace. 2/Proud to support the #FarmBill today. #Georgia’s number 1 industry is agribusiness, which contributes $73+ billion to our state’s economy. This bill sets a pro-farm, America-First agriculture policy through 2023. 1/I commend @housebudgetGOP Chairman @rep_stevewomack for his hard work &amp; leadership in writing a conservative budget for FY19.  It’s a bold vision that truly does ensure "A Brighter American Future."Happy #FathersDay to all the dads out there! I hope you enjoy your day and spend it with loved ones! https://t.co/a56MbDLPg0#OpioidEpidemic is devastating families across America. Bipartisan bills passed this week expand access to recovery centers, improve data to help at-risk patients, give law enforcement better tools &amp; help stop foreign shipments of illegal drugs. Read more: https://t.co/qTCLZvzSvgThank you @RepAndyHarrisMD for your hard work &amp; leadership on these important #prolife provisions. https://t.co/fzPTNhmOMoThis year's legislation might be the most #ProLife financial services appropriations bill ever. I’m proud of my Republicans colleagues for sticking together &amp; fighting off multiple attempts to strip these important pro-life provisions from the bill. https://t.co/iAT7wmQCVRGreat meeting with @PauldingCofC this week to discuss job creation &amp; economic development in #GA14. https://t.co/GYtWp8jAYuThe fund sets a new tone for appropriations bills: just because you can spend it, doesn’t mean you should spend it. It’s an approach that causes us to think about what all of this deficit spending means, in whose name we're borrowing the money &amp; who will get stuck w/ debt. 4/4We cut $585M across the bill to make an initial deposit. The money in this account can't be spent on any other govt program; it’s protected from spending process &amp; only accessible when the Treasury Secretary certifies that the budget deficit is zero or there is a surplus. 3/It also includes many significant financial reforms that slash harmful regulations &amp; streamline agency processes. Additionally, the bill creates the Fund for America’s Kids &amp; Grandkids, which safeguards funds for future generations. 2/Today @HouseAppropsGOP passed my financial services reform bill. It brings the rogue, unaccountable Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection under the appropriations process, which will finally subject it to congressional oversight and accountability. 1/.@houseappropsgop is considering my financial reform bill, which creates the Fund for America’s Kids and Grandkids.

I hope we can use today’s momentum to pass my bill through the House later this summer. 4/4Additionally, while #S2155 is a big step in the right direction, we must build on these initial reforms by providing even more relief to local banks &amp; the communities they support. 3/These community financial institutions are a lifeline in many rural areas &amp; small towns. Freeing these community institutions will increase access to credit &amp; help get the economy moving in some of the last areas to recover from the Great Recession. 2/#S2155 is a huge #Relief4MainStreet. By repealing some of the most harmful #DoddFrank regs, it frees credit unions &amp; community banks from the crushing regulatory environment imposed during the Obama admin. 1/Proud to support @RepDougCollins #FIRSTSTEPAct, which provides educational support, vocational training &amp; mental healthcare for all inmates.

But if Dems decide to use shutdown tactics again, I urge the Senate to modernize procedures so govt funding bills can pass with a simple majority. Dem abuse of the filibuster is failing the American pplThe #SchumerShutdown was a reckless ploy by Democrats to score political points against @POTUS &amp; Republicans in Congress. Their sole accomplishment was creating uncertainty for the troops, sick children &amp; all Americans. This shutdown didn’t need to happen.Democrats are putting sick kids at risk over illegal immigration. #schumbershutdown https://t.co/EGS04ScAS0Agree Mr. President: time to go nuclear #schumershutdown https://t.co/p58VEPCqHcTime for Senate to use nuclear option on govt funding bills. Dem abuse of 60 vote threshold is failing troops, sick children &amp; all Americans. 
#schumershudownUnacceptable. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/YzysA6DBxX94% of Republicans in Congress voted to keep govt open. 95% of Democrats in Congress voted to shut it down. Let's be clear on this. #SchumerShutdown3/3 The bottom line: few people understand why Democrats want to disrupt life for Americans, put national security at risk &amp; put sick children at risk over illegal immigration. There’s no pressing deadline &amp; no reason for them to abandon talks. #SchumerShutdown2/ Democrats are holding the entire govt hostage for a completely unrelated issue that doesn't have an immediate deadline – DACA. There have been high-level negotiations over illegal immigration &amp; border security for months. There’s just not an agreement yet. #SchumerShutdown1/ I supported the short-term govt funding bill that passed the House Thursday, which delays harmful #Obamacare taxes &amp; extends children’s health insurance for 6 yrs. The House did its job. #SchumerShutdownProud to vote for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, passage of which coincides with the 45th annual #MarchForLife – the world’s largest #ProLife event. #lovesaveslives https://t.co/5cmBpJpzAQ#CyberDiplomacyAct is an important step forward for U.S. cyber policy. 

Look forward to making more progress on cyber issues this yr, including the bill @RepSinema &amp; I introduced to give Americans more tools to protect themselves online #ACDCToday the House passed #CyberDiplomacyAct. It's a bipartisan, #AmericaFirst #cybersecurity bill that will help protect Georgians &amp; all Americans from foreign cybercriminals https://t.co/D0rNg7LSF1.@Apple "did promise to create 20,000 new jobs and a new campus thanks, in part, to the prospect of #TaxReform." #TaxReformWorks https://t.co/lOc3Mg5a6vKudos @CFPBDirector re small dollar lending rule reconsideration.

@RepDennisRoss @RepHastingsFL @RepCuellar @RepSteveStivers Rep Collin Peterson https://t.co/LdjJrjy4CX.@RepSinema &amp; I introduced an active cyber defense bill, #ACDC.

This will help banks provide loans &amp; other financial services to American consumers &amp; businesses.#TaxCutsandJobsAct is a #Christmas present for every American family &amp; business. Beginning on on January 1, 2018, the new tax code will take effect, meaning Americans will start taking home more of their hard-earned money as soon as February.#TaxCutsandJobsAct creates a simpler, flatter &amp; fairer tax code. It puts more money in the pockets of hard-working Georgia families &amp; spurs economic growth and private-sector job creation.This is a historic moment for our country. When @POTUS signs the #TaxCutsandJobsAct into law later this week, it will mark the first time the tax code was reformed in more than three decades.Today the House will vote on the final version of President Trump’s tax cuts and jobs bill, moving us a step closer to sending a final tax plan to the president’s desk. Let’s get tax reform to the finish line! https://t.co/QIUxiq7SyrTOMORROW the House will vote on @POTUS tax cuts &amp; jobs plan. Here are some highlights for your family:
✔️Cuts tax rates for every bracket 
✔️Nearly doubles the standard deduction for individuals and married couples
✔️Increases the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000I commend @AjitPaiFCC &amp; @FCC for approving a plan to restore internet freedom. It’s the result of an open and transparent process that provided all relevant documents and information to the public ahead of the vote. The plan will repeal Obama-era #NetNeutrality regulations.#NetNeutrality regulations stifled innovation and competition on the internet and did nothing to protect consumers. Returning to a free and open internet will ensure the online marketplace continues to flourish while increasing broadband access for rural and low-income Americans.Today we commemorate the 90th day since Hs passed govt funding bill w/ @realDonaldTrump priorities &amp; 90 days of Sen stalling. @SenateMajLdr why wait? Do it for the troops, for vets, for border security, for cancer patients. https://t.co/4T5DDjI9kuHouse responsibly funded @realDonaldTrump priorities: the wall, troop pay raise, strong defense &amp; takes care of veterans. Time for Senate to pass or amend.So what's a CR? A "Continuing Resolution" or the continuance of Obama-era policies = postponement of @realDonaldTrump priorities.#NDAA increases funding for national defense by $88.4 billion &amp; authorizes 20k more servicemembers. Importantly, it also provides a 2.4% pay raise for the troops - the largest in 8 years. Our men &amp; women in uniform deserve nothing less for the sacrifices they make to protect us.Today @potus signed #NDAA into law, which sends a powerful bipartisan message to our servicemembers that national defense is a national priority again. The bill greenlights the president's plan to rebuild the military..@realDonaldTrump @VP lots of talk of sending Senate another CR. No need. House passed Make America Secure Approps Act in July &amp; Make America Secure and Prosperous Approps Act in Sept. Senate should take one up, amend &amp; pass. @SenateMajLdr House floor time is valuable tooProud to vote to repeal #OperationChokepoint, which the Obama administration used to block businesses they disliked – such as gun stores and short-term lenders – from accessing bank loans and other financial services. An undeniable abuse of power.  https://t.co/rV1xislec4Today marks the 76th anniversary of Pearl Harbor - "a date which will live in infamy".

I urge the Senate to act quickly so we can send a final tax reform bill to the president as soon as possible. 4/4 https://t.co/sUK4OjMC5tAdditionally, the bill promotes economic growth and private-sector job creation by slashing the corporate tax rate – currently the highest in the developed world – and cutting tax rates for small business income to the lowest levels since World War II. 3/It will put more money in the pockets of hard-working #Georgia families and make the annual tax filing process a lot easier. In fact, the House Ways and Means Committee predicts the typical family could file their #taxes on a form the size of a postcard. 2/One reason the American people elected @POTUS and a Republican Congress is to cut taxes and help businesses create more American jobs. Our bill throws out the old system and creates a simpler, flatter and fairer #TaxCode. 1/Under the right leadership and with real changes, the @CFPB can play an important role in protecting American consumers and ensuring free market competition. 5/5The change in leadership is also an opportunity to enact significant reforms, such as restoring Congress’s constitutional role in oversight by bringing the @CFPB under the regular government funding process, a reform I included in my Financial Services Appropriations bill. 4/For far too long, middle-class families and community financial institutions suffered at the hands of a @CFPB director who put politics above consumer needs, particularly their access to credit.  3/The acting director appointed by President Trump must create a culture of accountability, insist on transparency and end @CFPB’s harmful attempts at vigilante justice. 2/It’s time to turn the page at the rogue, unaccountable @CFPB, which spends hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars every year without congressional approval. 1/#NDAA makes national defense a national priority again &amp; puts @POTUS plan to rebuild the military into action. It also makes critical investments that strengthen #Georgia’s contribution to our national defense.
