The news of the attack at The Capital Gazette is devastating. My heart breaks for those whose loved ones were lost in this senseless act of violence.The inclusion of $2.5 billion in funding for the first installment of KC-46 tankers is incredible news for our region. Congress has appropriated this money to purchase fifteen aircraft, some of which will be stationed at the Joint Base.

(2) https://t.co/Uoy4h4A1cIToday’s announcement about the Brick VA Clinic project is simply unacceptable. While the VA works out these contract issues, they must immediately address the parking issues our veterans are experiencing at the existing facility in Brick. (1)This week I met with Kenneth Rigmaiden, General President of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades and discussed supporting jobs in South Jersey. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me! https://t.co/DX634BdENsThis kind of hate is immoral, unacceptable, and un-American.

(3)I reached out to Kenya to show my support for her &amp; her family, &amp; she shared with me that she moved to Burlington County so her children would grow up in a safe community &amp; escape violence elsewhere. I assured her that my office is here to help her during this difficult time. (2)The hateful attack against Kenya Robinson is disgusting and has no place in our community. Kenya and her family should feel safe and welcome in their home as fellow New Jerseyans, not victimized because of their race or religion.

I remain convinced that his investigation must continue unimpeded.I’m grateful for his leadership and will continue to work with him to advance legislation that will improve the lives of New Jerseyans.Speaker Paul Ryan has been a selfless public servant and has led the House with strength and dignity.  Because of his leadership, we have been able to rebuild our military, roll back excessive regulations, and provide tax cuts for millions of middle-class families.It is especially important in advance of President Trump’s meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, to show the world that the United States means what we say and will not hesitate to defend our interests and keep our commitments.Assad, and countries like Iran and Russia, which continue to support this mad man, must know the days of America’s inaction are over.Last year, President Trump took decisive action when Assad launched a chemical weapons attack against his own people and the President should take appropriate action now.America must take action and send a strong message to Assad and his enablers in Russia and Iran that the United States will not allow this type of violence to go unanswered.This weekend, Assad launched yet another barbaric chemical attack against Syrians, killing many innocent people, including children.Thank you for your service! Your sacrifice will never be forgotten. https://t.co/ozhxF3cbL150 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was tragically assassinated in Memphis.

We must continue to stand with our friends in the face of Russian aggression. (2)Russia’s destabilizing behavior, including their attempts to influence our elections and the recent attack in England, is reckless and hostile. Today’s actions by the United States, and our allies across the globe, send a strong message to Russia. (1)-strengthens the background check system
-amends the Dickey Amendment to allow the CDC to conduct research on gun violence
-more money for school safety and law enforcement
-increases funding for mental health programs (3)
https://t.co/j9g484mydTI outlined several action items, most of which were addressed in the bipartisan bill passed by Congress this week (2):In the immediate aftermath of the devastating shooting in Parkland, I got together with people representing views across the political spectrum about ways we can make our communities safer.

These young student leaders do so much in our community and it was fun to chat with them about current events. https://t.co/9TrLVq4gpyI'm about to join @SaveJersey for a Facebook live. Click here to check it out: https://t.co/lQqLy3gLYvGreat news today from Starbucks. It's incredible to see another company investing in front line employees. https://t.co/DrPCsTF7X5Here’s a quick recap of the work I did during the shutdown: https://t.co/fsXEI1kjwqI hope @SenatorMenendez &amp; @SenBooker do their jobs and put politics aside to vote to reopen the government. Not only is it the right thing to do, but our troops and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst are counting on them.South Jersey is home to thousands of military members; we depend on them and they must be able to depend on us. There is no excuse for this shutdown, but until it’s resolved, we need to do the right thing by our troops – Period. https://t.co/6ja5U71nnBThis legislation will ensure service men and women continue to get a paycheck while prohibiting Members of Congress from receiving a salary during the government shutdown.It is unacceptable to me that Members of Congress are still paid during a government shutdown, while the men and women of the United States Armed Forces are not, which is why I cosponsored the Pay Our Protectors, Not Our Politicians Act.Thanks to @GovMurphy for hosting a bipartisan call w/federal officials to discuss the shutdown, which we all agree is hurting NJ. I encouraged @SenatorMenendez &amp; @SenBooker to join bipartisan group of colleagues to reopen govt and deal w/DACA immediately afterwards. https://t.co/AjzwcD7XxlIt is unacceptable to me that Members of Congress are still being paid, while our troops, federal law enforcement officers, and other government employees are not. https://t.co/4f8HkhuGKXI am requesting that Congress withhold my salary until an appropriations agreement has taken effect. https://t.co/CKEAwoDIvY...as well as vulnerable children in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) like bargaining chips. This is no way to run our government and the American people deserve better.Members of both parties need to stop treating the funding of the federal government like a political football.  Instead of finding a solution that would keep our government open, some politicians have resorted to treating our military men and women,...I came to Washington to get things done and have always been willing to work with anyone to solve the serious problems facing our country. Unfortunately, it appears like some people in Washington do not feel the same way.I am extremely concerned about reports that the Administration is considering a 95% budget cut to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and remain completely opposed to any effort to downsize this office...https://t.co/h3prNaMbEqAnd soon in February-- no matter who you work for-- the vast majority of American wage-earners will receive bigger paychecks.More than 160 companies have come out and announced bonuses, wage increases, and reinvestment in the U.S. economy—all thanks to tax reform. Just this week, Celgene announced it will be opening a new research center in New Jersey—creating 500 new jobs.Yesterday, I joined @BillSpadea on @nj1015 to discuss the positive impacts of tax reform. https://t.co/cSnZr0sKWvNow, both the House and Senate must compromise on a permanent budget to fund these key priorities.That being said, I'm grateful we will use this opportunity to achieve a much-needed, long-term re-authorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), fund our military, and fight against addiction.I will vote for the Continuing Resolution, but let's not confuse this for success.  Funding the government of the greatest nation on earth one month at a time is no way to govern.I am categorically opposed to shutting down the government and urge leaders in both parties to stop the political brinksmanship.  The American people elected us to confront and solve tough problems, not retreat to our respective corners and point fingers at each other.I am proud to support Lloyd’s efforts and to call him a friend. A big thank you to Lloyd for his continued service to our country and community.

Dr Greene from the Second Baptist Church of Toms River asked me to address his congregation at their special service honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Here are my full remarks: https://t.co/VJyiAGDz0NI genuinely believe that we can work together to protect our environment and our shore economy from the dangers posed by drilling for oil off New Jersey’s coast. (3)The Secretary also reiterated his promise that stakeholders, including elected officials, local businesses, and fishing industry-related groups would be consulted on this issue. I appreciate Secretary Zinke’s friendship and the time he took to discuss this with me. (2)Yesterday, I spoke directly to @SecretaryZinke about the Dept. of Interior's Draft Proposed Plan. I have been, and remain opposed to oil drilling off the New Jersey coast. He assured me of continued communication and transparency surrounding this plan. (1.)As we work towards a solution on DACA and border security, we should all keep in mind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s timeless words that what matters most is the content of one's character, not the color of their skin or where they were born. (3)I have also spent significant time and resources in Africa working to strengthen communities that are filled with some of the most amazing people I have ever met. (2)The circumstances of someone’s birth does not define their value and should not determine the outcome of their life. As the father of two children adopted from Korea, I have seen this principle play out in meaningful ways in my own life.
