Today, I toured Sleeper‚Äôs Ridge Holstein in Horseheads and had an open and honest conversation about the struggles dairy farmers are facing. Thank you, Gina and Lance, for letting me get a feel of what your day-to-day is like on the farm.  @NYFarmBureau @nmpf https://t.co/31oIxhLP15This record setting optimism is no accident. It is a reflection of the game-changing tax reform passed six months ago. Manufacturers are expecting surges in hiring, investments and wages as a result. Great news for #NY23! https://t.co/cU0JXGwXyaThe Supreme Court‚Äôs travel ban decision upholds our president‚Äôs action to help keep our nation safe from threats abroad. https://t.co/BhizBRZQG2Last week, I introduced one of my interns, Will Tucker, to the great American Hero, @SamsPressShop who serves with me on @WaysandMeansGOP.

By working together , we can make communities safer and begin to break the gridlock. https://t.co/S1XqbM8sPXTogether, we are working to attack the problems facing our country - not people. https://t.co/A5bfq6jtE6We recently met with successful clients from the Chautauqua Workforce Investment Board and @FingerLakesWIB.

I am hopeful that the ongoing talks with Canada will produce real results for American workers and businesses. 2/2We are encouraged by President Trump‚Äôs leadership to address Canada‚Äôs unfair and protectionist dairy policies, and we continue to work on eliminating these practices so that New York dairy farmers can compete on a level playing field. 1/2 https://t.co/BQly8GGRleWhen a community comes together with an idea to honor those who served and who are currently serving, the end result is a ‚ÄúLiving Memorial‚Äù.

https://t.co/rlFXf2r2hKThousands of New Yorkers are drowning in student loan debt just like those in this article. We currently give these schools huge tax breaks and subsidies, and it is time they start serving the working-class taxpayer who supports them.

Without promotion of careers in this field, there will be a shortage of a skilled, qualified workforce for existing and future jobs in high-tech manufacturing. 1/2Immigration has paralyzed Congress for too long. That is why I am working with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to increase border security and provide a solution for our nation's dreamers. #BreakTheGridlock https://t.co/rAVtD7mkX5Let us today, and every day, reflect upon the sacrifices made by those in our armed services to keep us safe and protect our freedoms. üá∫üá∏ 3/3 https://t.co/0elgCdFblcIt was my honor to participate in Waterloo‚Äôs annual parade to remember all of the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect and defend our great nation. 2/3 https://t.co/jhMAper8ZxIn 1966, the House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed a resolution designating Waterloo, NY as the birthplace of Memorial Day. 1/3 https://t.co/tmOVPchM9MThat is why I testified last week to the Subcommittee on Environment through the House Committee of Energy and Commerce. 3/3 https://t.co/KIAfUDxpAyThe Department of Energy estimates that making the investments needed now in nuclear site remediation will save our nation hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming decades. 2/3There are still nuclear sites in the United States that need to be managed and cleaned up.

(3/3)President Trump has always known when to walk away from the table, and the cancellation of the summit with North Korea is a perfect example of just that. It is now up to Kim Jong-un to demonstrate whether he is going to be committed to peace or war on the peninsula. (2/3)I support the President‚Äôs leadership in keeping our nation‚Äôs security his top priority rather than seeking an achievement for political reasons that results in a false diplomatic success.
