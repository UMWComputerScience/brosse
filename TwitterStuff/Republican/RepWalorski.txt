Better guidelines, codified roles, and more intentional strategic planning can.Unforced errors are turning vital projects into boondoggles. The IRS isn’t even asking the most basic questions before spending millions on software.Some of the IRS’s IT systems date back to the Kennedy administration, but repeated mistakes big and small undermine our trust in the IRS to fix them.There’s a trust gap between taxpayers and the IRS, and the IRS’s information technology systems are a good example of why.WATCH: I’m about to speak on the House floor about the bipartisan 21st Century IRS Act, which will modernize the IRS so it better serves taxpayers. https://t.co/R65vthTyvuThanks to retired Army Col.
