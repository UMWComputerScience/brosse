Truly bicameral, bipartisan legislation. Good for job creators, good for consumers, good for communities.Most significant pro-growth banking deregulation bill in almost a generation. Finally cutting the unnecessary red tape that prevents hardworking taxpayers from accessing the credit they need to buy a home, a car, or finance their American Dream.Thrilled to see this bipartisan bill pass the House and head to the President‚Äôs desk! For too long Dodd-Frank has stifled the growth of main-street job creators by burying community banks in federal regulations and red-tape. That changes now.

This administration‚Äôs leadership has just secured a fantastic victory. I‚Äôm hopeful we will continue making progress towards denuclearizing North Korea and protecting our nation. https://t.co/amtnGHS4E9Overall, the Chairman‚Äôs mark better addresses our future readiness challenges. It accelerates the 355-ship navy and the expected projection forces our nation so desperately needs.  #FY19NDAAIn brief, we authorized the 4th Ford-class Aircraft carrier, expanded procurement of the Littoral Combat Ship, and made critical investments toward two additional attack submarines in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.  #FY19NDAABecause of these tough choices and a commitment to be good stewards of the taxpayers‚Äô dollar, we were able to accelerate major Seapower and Projection Forces equities.  #FY19NDAATo this end, our Seapower and Projection Forces mark sought and achieved a balance of current and future readiness. #FY19NDAAAs the former Readiness Subcommittee Chairman, I'm painfully aware that readiness is composed of two major components: current readiness and future readiness. Without an adequate balance between the two, we cannot hope to be successful in the future of armed conflict.  #FY19NDAAAnd we‚Äôre live. Ready for a full day of #FY19NDAA WATCH HERE:  https://t.co/frEbDIncuZ https://t.co/oUiY3LDt9SPresident Trump has made his decision.

A certification or credential towards a trade can get folks directly into a career in the 21st century workforce.We‚Äôve got to do more to close this gap. This means bringing together education institutions and businesses to create more tangible skills development in our education curriculum.There are too many students graduating with massive student loan debt struggling to get jobs and too many businesses who can‚Äôt find qualified workers.There‚Äôs a mismatch between our children‚Äôs education and skills needed for high-paying, in-demand jobs.

@GerryConnolly https://t.co/wjR6pSxhV6Heartbroken for these children and their families. Praying for them and all the brave law enforcement and first responders on the scene. https://t.co/dLFPvRdJj5We have seen the success of the Bay Program through clearer water, more oysters and more blue crabs, demonstrating that the federal and multi-state partnership to restore the Bay is working.Severely reducing funding for this program would be shortsighted and unacceptable. #VA01 https://t.co/uuHI1m44xSConcerned that the Navy‚Äôs latest shipbuilding plan doesn‚Äôt get us to 355 ships even though Navy and Congressional leaders support a fleet of this size. Committed to working w/ my colleagues to authorize the funds needed to reach this goal. https://t.co/qQ3qXFz0czCheering on our fellow Virginians during the Olympics. Go Team USA! üá∫üá∏

https://t.co/zykO9PRZ81Another story about how #taxreform is helping folks back in #VA01! https://t.co/tJp5HUsh22Led a letter w/ the Virginia Delegation to @POTUS emphasizing the importance of the Hampton Roads Naval Community  ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/LL7WHpI8kWGreat news right out of #VA01! #TaxReform https://t.co/3gpakQtdsdIt's not perfect &amp; going forward we must address auto-pilot spending. But this is the deal our Sailors, Marines, Soldiers, and Airman need.The Bipartisan Budget Act provides the path forward to rebuild our military and give our troops the resources to keep our nation safe.When Mattis calls and says this budget agreement is what our Armed Forces need to survive, I believe him.SECDEF Mattis to me yesterday: I cannot overstate the negative impacts of continuing resolutions enough. Another round of budget uncertainty will erode our readiness. https://t.co/68UAiGPMdaFull statement: https://t.co/S6pBPwEU6d https://t.co/7vH2qQSg0gWe cannot continue to hold our military hostage. #SetOurTroopsFree
https://t.co/HfWq9jbaGQIt is our responsibility to give our service members the resources they need. This is not a partisan issue; we must fund our military.Sobering reminder from Sec. Mattis this morning: https://t.co/jyjHlNIW5bI‚Äôve said this whole time that transparency is critical &amp; Americans deserve the truth. I stand by that. So long as it doesn‚Äôt compromise national security, the memo created by the Democrats should be made public.We must fully fund our military. Readiness can‚Äôt suffer any longer.    https://t.co/jHf5Xmc5OuNational Defense Strategy &amp; Nuclear Posture Review lay out the critical work to be done, but we first need a defense budget and an end to CRs. Hearing on this next Tuesday. https://t.co/b5YPNDvEJzTransparency is key. Releasing the memo was the right move. https://t.co/IyVW7JJLRXUntil our Sailors and Marines can walk on water, we better be building them ships. #355Ships 

My latest in @NavyTimes: https://t.co/Fmj7IB8vTRWasn‚Äôt on the train to West Virginia. Praying everyone is safe!For our nation as a whole &amp; especially #VA01 it‚Äôs critical that we continue to develop a robust shipbuilding industry and stronger Navy. #SOTUWe must set the correct levels of funding and end this cycle of passing CR‚Äôs. Our armed services deserve the certainty of sufficient &amp; reliable funding. #SOTUOptimistic we will address our readiness shortfalls:
Smallest @USNavy since WWI
Smallest @USArmy since WWII
Smallest @usairforce ever
We are not equipping men and women in uniform to do the job we‚Äôve asked of them. #SOTUNorth Korea, Russia, Iran, China, ISIS‚Ä¶As threats increase, so do the demands on our service members. @POTUS is right to emphasize increasing military readiness and ending the defense sequester. #SOTUEncouraged by the House vote on defense appropriations earlier today and @POTUS‚Äô emphasis on rebuilding our military. #SOTUWe must prepare our next generation with the skills to succeed, whether that‚Äôs a certification, a credential, or a four-year degree. @POTUS understands that. #SOTUHopeful that any infrastructure package includes policies that promote increased access to broadband. It‚Äôs time to level the playing field and bring the rural areas of #VA01 into the digital economy #SOTULooking forward to this Administration‚Äôs leadership on an infrastructure package that reduces red tape, leverages private/public partnerships, addresses priorities for rural Americans, and improves the daily lives of Virginians. #SOTUWe all know the DMV &amp; #VA01 have their fair share of transportation obstacles. #SOTUOur government should be by the people, for the people. That means holding Washington accountable. If we can‚Äôt pass our budget and appropriations bills on time, we shouldn‚Äôt get a paycheck or August vacation.  #NoBudgetNoPay #SOTUOver the last month we‚Äôve seen the power of pro-growth policy. Tax Reform is working and millions of Americans are experiencing it firsthand! #TaxReform #TaxCutsandJobsAct #SOTUProviding real relief for small businesses and working-class families! #SOTU #TaxReformWe promised. We delivered. This sure isn‚Äôt crumbs. #TaxReform #SOTU"We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We endured floods and fires and storms.  But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine." @POTUS #SOTUHere we go! #SOTU https://t.co/AEfLZ3oRIaChatting with w/ @FitzFox5DC @fox5dc #SOTU https://t.co/b4T7DcEU4HFull statement: https://t.co/Hl0oTfun9dToday‚Äôs vote on defense appropriations: still serious about funding our militaryTune in at 5:10PM! #SOTU https://t.co/RG8glpGfTcDecades in the making!

Looking forward to continued leadership from this administration.Bringing high speed internet access to rural America has the potential to unleash untapped human capital and spur job creation across all sectors of the economy.That's why I've sent a letter to @POTUS urging him to include policies that promote broadband investments in the upcoming infrastructure package: https://t.co/PfgPon7jxVFrom the Northern Neck to the Middle Peninsula, thousands of my constituents lack access to high speed internet.  Closing the #digitaldivide is critical to economic prosperity.More great news for our economy! #TaxReform keeps on delivering. https://t.co/dnmrezzSdNIt‚Äôs absolutely critical that we address military readiness shortfalls by setting proper levels of funding and assessing where necessary changes need to be made.
