Always grateful to help out a fellow Alabamian, and Representative, @RepTerriSewell. Thanks for the 4th of July cupcakes in return! https://t.co/ogL0my6jlGAbout 6 months ago, @POTUS signed the #TaxCutsandJobsAct putting money back into the pockets of taxpayers. Today, @USDA stated the new tax code will ease the burden on farmers across the nation allowing them to further boost the economy and put more food on American tables. https://t.co/FaQlQPcwEZThanks to the @60PlusAssoc for presenting me the Guardian of Seniors’ Rights award. I am proud to advocate for saving Social Security and Medicare for today’s seniors while strengthening it for future generations. https://t.co/5JjmntolBSWhile Justice Kennedy proudly served the American people, I look forward to @POTUS nominating an honorable and well-qualified jurist. I encourage the U.S. Senate to not wait but to act quickly to confirm the President’s eventual nominee before the new Supreme Court term begins.This morning I spoke to the Joint Select Committee on Budget &amp; Appropriations Process Reform on how Congress can get back to regular order and away from continuing resolutions and omnibus appropriations bills- it starts with the U.S. Senate getting away from their filibuster rule https://t.co/ffQjJCMdy1“Had a great working lunch with President Trump today to discuss the way forward on Appropriations so that we can fund the border wall as well as avoid another huge Omnibus” @realdonaldtrump #Appropriations https://t.co/Bf6BVANLGGTwo great rulings today from SCOTUS. The court struck down the California law that forced pro-life groups to advertise abortion. And the court upheld the power Congress gave the President to limit travel to America to protect national security.My heart breaks for the family of Steve Marshall upon hearing of the passing of his wife Bridgette. I ask you to join me in lifting him, their daughter, family and friends in prayer at this tremendously difficult time.Reporter tracks down “face” of border separation, exposes child was not separated and “asylum seeking” mother simply wanted economic opportunity.

Problem is that this does not fit narrative being told by DC...but is by far the typical case at the border.

Truth of matter is that North Korea detainees were released and more progress towards denuclearization made than under last 3 presidents. https://t.co/EXeOV6Eq53Sometimes people in Washington say something just can’t be done.

Every year Alabama veterans arrive in Washington, D.C. through a program called @HonorFlightNet. https://t.co/M2vVQ73BtfPresident Trump continues to impress with his foreign policy achievements. Like Reagan before him, the President is achieving “peace through strength.” https://t.co/3vrcFz5hwgThere are several things that remain puzzling about the agreement.  For example, many of us are still waiting to see what benefits the Obama Administration hoped to see when they delivered pallets of cash in the dead of night to Iran, a known state sponsor of terrorism.President Trump has taken the Iran Nuclear Deal, and its shortcomings, very seriously. With all the information he has at his disposal, I trust that he has made the right decision to pull back from what was a bad deal adopted under the Obama Administration.Tonight on the steps of our Gadsden office, 80 high school students took their military oaths. They are going into the Army, Air Force and Marines. You all make us proud with your commitment to serve our nation. @WBRCnews @WVTM13 @abc3340 @CBS_42 https://t.co/ACA6Ak6N2VToday I welcomed @SecretarySonny of @USDA to Guin, AL where we discussed how important agriculture industries are to the state of Alabama as well as the nation.

I enjoyed talking to and answering the students’ questions during my visit. https://t.co/XpjOCXkxtR@MikeCasonAL ...just another example of how our tax cuts are hitting everybody’s bottom line. 

Unemployment is at a 17 year low w/ Alabama leading the national average. Wages are going up as the economy continues to grow due to lower taxes and less federal regulation. #MAGA @realDonaldTrumpOn this day, I pray for the countless families and communities that are still grief stricken and I pray for the continued progress of rebuilding our communities. https://t.co/P5DHnW6o4YIf we gained anything that day, it was a stronger sense of community.

I hope this information can help people understand this entire situation.The public should be able to have confidence that our institutions, including the FBI, are not being politicized in favor of one candidate over another.   That's why we need transparency to show what the true facts were.   This is not the way the system should work.I am very pleased the FISA memo from the House Intelligence Committee has been released to the public. I read the memo two weeks ago,  and felt the information was extremely important and should be seen by the American people. https://t.co/j43vun850lI just wanted to send a quick note to let everyone know Caroline and I are fine. We were on the train headed to a Republican planning conference when the train collided with a truck. I’m told one person in the truck has died. Our prayers to that person’s family &amp; any others hurt.The polling shows that the American people overwhelmingly felt the same way about the President’s speech as I did, with great approval! #SOTU2018 https://t.co/ctfuHVeDgPBecause of President Trump’s willingness to shake things up in Washington, and to step over entrenched partisan lines, the State of the Union is strong.Despite resistance from the Washington establishment, President Trump’s first year has been marked with robust economic growth, job creation, record highs in the stock market and record lows when it comes to unemployment.I’m looking forward to President Trump’s first SOTU speech tonight. It begins at 8pm Central Time.  #SOTU2018 https://t.co/fOwYhEwBfuI applaud the vote by the House Intelligence Committee tonight to release the FISA memo to the American people.  #ReleaseTheMemo5.

If allowed by my colleagues to serve as the next chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I look forward to addressing these challenges.3. It is too soon to talk about changes and reforms to the appropriations process, but there is no doubt that major changes need to be made.2. As Chairman, he had the distinction of helping to move all twelve Appropriations bills through the House for the first time in more than a decade.1. Rodney Frelinghuysen has served with honor and distinction.  He will be missed for his level-headed thinking and service as Chairman of Appropriations.@Copacetic_Cindy @realDonaldTrump I support releasing the memoI want to thank @realDonaldTrump and the great White House staff for inviting my staff and me to bowl tonight at the White House Bowling Alley. https://t.co/eph04HMCkmI read the classified House Intelligence Committee memo that details concerns about FISA surveillance abuses by the previous administration. Suffice it to say that I believe that the public should be able to view the same memo I did.  

#ReleaseTheMemoLet me be clear, House Members do not feel bound to resolve the differences in DACA &amp; immigration before the next funding deadline. House leadership has been consistent in their belief that these are two separate issues that will be resolved on two separate legislative tracks.While the #schumershutdown continues, Monday morning my staff and I will be in our offices working as usual to do the people’s business.Hard to negotiate anything when the hostage has been shot and bleeding out ...
