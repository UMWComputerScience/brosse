This bipartisan compromise should have near unanimous support. The end result is $6.5 billion toward eliminating the national park maintenance backlog, $215 million of which is in the @GreatSmokyNPS.I’ve joined @senrobportman, @MarkWarner, @SenAngusKing, @SenCoryGardner and @SenCapito in introducing the Restore Our Parks Act – legislation that could do more to restore our 417 national parks than anything that has happened in the last half century. https://t.co/u1Ll6Ov5EZGood news for Johnson City: The @ARCgov just awarded @CoJCTN $400,000 to invest in water infrastructure.#PerkinsCTE would make important, necessary updates to career and technical education to give workers and students the skills they need to find high-skill, high-wage and in-demand jobs. Thank you @SenatorEnzi and @IvankaTrump for your work to get this legislation reauthorized. https://t.co/JZSSQHVHSjThis settlement payment should finally end the discussion about whether to build the North Shore Road, which is impractical today because of environmental concerns and enormous cost. Thank you @SenThomTillis for your work to make this happen.Good news: On Saturday, @SecretaryZinke will be delivering the residents of Swain County the $35 million settlement payment for the North Shore Road in the Smokies – this is long overdue based on a promise made 75 years ago. https://t.co/8bknnJwIXaThe #PerkinsCTE Act will send over $20 million a year to Tennessee for high school students and college students to learn more skilled trades so they can get even better jobs. https://t.co/COnSav08erWhat I hear most often from TN employers is that we need more skilled workers. The Senate education committee advanced #PerkinsCTE, which will send over $20M a year to TN for workers &amp; students to learn more skilled trades so they can find high-skill, high-wage &amp; in-demand jobs. https://t.co/gpHD8RYKjYToday, the Senate approved the Tennessee Wilderness Act as a part of the farm bill, legislation I introduced with @SenBobCorker and @DrPhilRoe to designate land in the Cherokee National Forest as wilderness area, to conserve some of the most beautiful areas in our state. https://t.co/8XvpISl6xIHad a great time showing one of Tennessee’s favorite sons, @phillipfulmer, and a few other #Vols around my Washington office today. #GBO #VFL https://t.co/GmUOwN5OSrThe Senate education committee advanced the bipartisan #PerkinsCTE Act to fund the programs that help train the skilled workers we need. Thank you @IvankaTrump and @SenatorEnzi for your leadership in updating this important law for students and adult workers. https://t.co/uKzPgO38lvThe House passed their legislation in April, and today, the Senate committee has done its part – now, the full Senate must pass the #MusicModernizationAct so it will be closer to becoming law this year. #StandWithSongwriters https://t.co/nlGFWOjXRZAgriculture is one of Tennessee’s most important industries, with more than 66,000 farms contributing tens of billions of dollars each year to our state’s economy. Today’s Senate passage of the farm bill is a big win for Tennessee’s 340,000 farmers. https://t.co/1abaxtG02TThe @senjudiciary approved the #MusicModernizationAct, which includes bipartisan legislation @senorrinhatch, @ChuckGrassley and I introduced. Songwriters in TN and across the country are one step closer to being paid fair market value for their work. #StandWithSongwriters https://t.co/lg3WxhPRsxThe Senate Appropriations Committee approved a defense spending bill that provides the largest pay increase since 2010 for the men and women serving in the military– including those at Fort Campbell and Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington. https://t.co/7zzoSHueQsI’m headed to the Senate Appropriations Committee where we will consider funding bills for the @DeptofDefense, @USDOL, @HHSGov and @usedgov. You can listen to the meeting online here: https://t.co/8fCY5hWies https://t.co/fwfM3YUy7PTune in at 7:45 AM CDT for my conversation with @MyTimVanHorn on @600WREC. Listen online here: https://t.co/Aop4mTjq0yThe Senate health committee I chair held its first in a series of hearings to explore how to reduce health care costs in America. Today, we heard about the importance of more competition as a way to bring down costs. https://t.co/RoYsnRvO0TThe Senate HELP committee approved the reauthorization of the PREEMIE Act, aimed at preventing premature births. It includes important updates to address the current opioid crisis, because expectant mothers taking opioids are at higher risk of delivering their babies prematurely. https://t.co/GW05NM0chpThank you for stopping by my office today. It was great meeting you, Leeya! https://t.co/avkfrTcKzoMost Tennesseans think two things about health care costs – one, they are too high, and two, they are indecipherable. We began a series of five hearings this morning in the Senate health committee, which I chair, to look for ways to reduce health care costs. https://t.co/xZHDUmiQAmI hope President Trump will promptly nominate his successor, and I’m confident the Senate will move quickly to carefully consider that nominee.Anthony Kennedy has served on the United States Supreme Court with intelligence and with distinction as he has interpreted and defended the Constitution in a deliberate and responsible way. https://t.co/dNfH7fjDhsAbout one out of every ten babies born in Tennessee is born early. And the Senate took action in our committee to help reduce the number of babies born preterm and then help skilled professionals take care of those babies. https://t.co/q5inxuxgdXGood news that the @UTHSC is receiving national accreditation for its mobile stroke unit – the first of its kind in the world! As chairman of the Senate's health committee, I've worked to help UT and other mobile stroke providers receive reimbursements from @CMSGov. https://t.co/d4nh77uCR0Today we will take the first step toward reducing health care costs by understanding the cost of health care – to taxpayers, employers, and individuals like Todd.So, Todd was surprised when he received a bill for $1800 – because even though the emergency room was “in-network,” the doctor who treated his son was not.That is what I heard from Todd, a Knoxville father, who recently took his son to an emergency room after a bicycle accident. His son was treated, Todd paid a $150 copay because the emergency room was “in-network” for his health insurance, and they headed home.The average American is shocked by the cost of their health care. They don’t understand what they are being charged for and why it costs so much, and they want better answers.The most obvious fact about health care costs, other than that they’re too high, is that they are indecipherable. Any one of us who has received a hospital bill in the mail or has tried to figure out their health insurance benefits has wondered what it all means.The first step to reducing health care costs is to better understand the cost of health care in America and understand why health care in America costs so much more than it does in other countries.Warren Buffett has called the ballooning costs of health care…“a hungry tapeworm on the American economy.”According to the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the @HHSGov, which is the health data office at HHS, we spent $2.2 trillion dollars on health care in 2006. This is projected to grow to $5.7 trillion in 2026 – that is a 159 percent increase.So today, we are beginning a series of hearings looking at how to reduce health care costs, including examining administrative costs, waste, how to improve transparency, private sector solutions, and other important issues as they come up.But, the hard truth is that we will never get the cost of health insurance down until we get the cost of health care down.For the last seven years, Republicans and Democrats have been locked in a debate over health insurance, primarily the individual insurance market, which is important but is where only six percent of insured Americans get their health insurance.I’m headed to chair our bipartisan Senate health committee hearing to better understand the cost of health care in America. It’s the first in a series of hearings to explore how to reduce health care costs.  Watch here: https://t.co/sb5IT2pwCH https://t.co/mnvboCkoS9It was great to have @IvankaTrump here today as the Senate HELP Committee advanced the #PerkinsCTE Act. Thank you, Ivanka, for your leadership in updating this important law for students and adult workers. https://t.co/octdixAgLkI am glad to see we are moving forward in a bipartisan way on important bills and nominees. This committee has reached significant legislative accomplishments so far this year, and we still have six months to go.This bipartisan reauthorization by @SenatorEnzi and @SenBobCasey limits the role of the Secretary of Education and allows states to make changes that are best for their students and more closely align to the CTE programs with our workforce system and needs.In Tennessee, over 200,000 students participate in CTE programs, with the most popular programs preparing students for careers in health care, business administration and agriculture. #PerkinsCTECompanies in Tennessee, and across the U.S., are in the market for not just workers, but especially for skilled workers. #PerkinsCTE is a nearly $1.2 billion federal program of grants to states that help fund programs that train the workers we need.The committee will also vote on the bipartisan reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. #PerkinsCTEThis reauthorization, led by @SenBennet and myself, includes important updates to address the opioid crisis, because expectant mothers taking opioids are at higher risk of delivering their babies prematurely.The PREEMIE Act was first signed into law by President Bush in 2006 and reauthorized in 2013. This law has helped give more babies the chance for long and healthy lives. It is important we pass this bill today so the full Senate can consider it before many of the programs expire.We are also voting on Scott Stump as Assistant Secretary for Career, Technical, and Adult Education at the @usedgov and John Lowry III to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans’ Employment and Training at the @USDOL.Today we are considering the PREEMIE Act, sponsored by @SenBennet and myself, followed by three additional bills: Maternal Health Accountability Act, Sports Licensure Medical Clarity Act and the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.I’m headed to chair the Senate HELP Committee’s markup of the PREEMIE Act, Maternal Health Accountability Act, Sports Licensure Medical Clarity Act and the #PerkinsCTE Act. Watch here: https://t.co/P6lPwjCnne https://t.co/5gq5AY0lb5Today at 2:30 EDT, the Senate HELP Committee is voting on #PerkinsCTE.

But last week and tonight we have taken an appropriations process, which has been incomplete and broken for the last several years, and we have done what we are supposed to do.Senators shouldn't get an award for restoring the appropriations process any more than Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts should get a merit badge for telling the truth, because that's what we are supposed to do. https://t.co/eOukc9twlgToday, the Senate confirmed Frank Brogan to serve as @usedgov’s Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. I look forward to working with him as he oversees our education law that restores more freedom of decision-making to states and local schools.Today’s bill includes the fourth year of record funding for our 17 national laboratories and third year of increased funding for biomedical research. https://t.co/eOukc9twlgToday, the Senate passed the first appropriations bills for the next fiscal year, including the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill from the subcommittee I chair. https://t.co/LTwfvuIKGeHAPPENING NOW https://t.co/kPZuZRuIW2I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor at approximately 4:50 PM EDT in support of the final passage of the Energy and Water Development funding bill that came out of the subcommittee I chair.

For example, bakeries and small sporting-goods stores in Chattanooga, Tenn., could come together and purchase a plan for their employees.Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and the Trump administration have come up with a potential solution within existing law.Today, if you’re a self-employed plumber or a farmer or a waitress at a small restaurant, you likely don’t have access to the same kind of lower-cost health insurance, tax breaks and patient protections that employees of bigger companies, such as IBM or Microsoft, enjoy.READ: My op-ed in the Washington Post on a new rule from @POTUS and @SecretaryAcosta that will help self-employed Americans and more small businesses to band together to buy health insurance coverage through Association Health Plans. https://t.co/gSMeYhDFtXThis new rule could help the self-employed and employees of small businesses get access to lower cost employer insurance  — both groups have been particularly hurt by Obamacare. #AHPsNew #AHPs initiative could allow a self-employed Tennessee plumber or farmer or employee of a small business to buy lower cost employer health insurance that includes the same protections, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions, that employees of large companies have.New Trump Administration #AHPs rule would give potentially millions more Americans access to lower-cost employer insurance. https://t.co/1D4QQvy0l9My statement on the separation of children from their parents at the border: https://t.co/eUnaRQG31iRight now, @HRSAgov has clear authority to determine if hospitals, clinics, and drug companies are eligible to participate in the 340B Program. However, it is unclear if it has the statutory authority to oversee other aspects of the program.Congress needs more accurate information to determine how to make the 340B Program work better for patients and hospitals. https://t.co/sFP0ks8DNAI look forward to hearing from our witness with @HRSAgov today, and our other committee members about what Congress can do to evaluate the 340B Program, measure the program’s performance, and ensure that the agency responsible for the program is conducting proper oversight.Data is necessary to demonstrate the value of the 340B Program, and Congress cannot evaluate the program, conduct oversight, or consider changes to improve the program without more information.We learned at our two previous hearings on the program, there is no consistent data that shows how hospitals and clinics are spending the money they save through the 340B Program.Some of the time, the 340B discount is passed directly to the patient as a lower priced drug. Other times, the hospital or clinic uses the savings to provide other services to patients like the programs Methodist, Saint Thomas, and Erlanger run.They are all able to provide these services because of the money they save by participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which requires drug manufacturers that participate in Medicaid to provide discounts on prescriptions drugs to qualifying hospitals and clinics.And, Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga delivers prescription drugs at no cost to low-income patients at their homes, to ensure they are receiving and taking their medications.Saint Thomas Health in Nashville operates four Dispensary of Hope pharmacy sites across the state of Tennessee, providing low-income, uninsured patients with free or low-cost prescription drugs..@SenAlexander: At Methodist Hospital in downtown Memphis, five employees working as “community navigators” go to events in Memphis to give local residents preventative cancer tests and refer them to the Methodist cancer treatment center if necessary.I’m headed to chair the health committee’s third bipartisan hearing this year on the 340B Drug Pricing Program to ask @HRSAgov if it needs more authority from Congress to ensure that patients are benefiting from the program.

We heard from @HHSGov @SecAzar on @POTUS’s blueprint to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. https://t.co/0n3qQbRyOsWishing @GeorgeHWBush a very happy birthday! https://t.co/rRk4xfpzZlTune in at 7:35 PM EDT to @foxnewsradio for my conversation with @BensonAndHarf. https://t.co/1qExPP8g9WThe Trump Administration’s comprehensive drug pricing blueprint will bring help to the one in eight Americans who say it is difficult to afford their prescriptions. https://t.co/uqKena0CptI’m speaking on the Senate floor to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on becoming the longest serving Republican Majority Leader of the Senate. Watch here: https://t.co/KSRxE3IpJnThese are a few of the proposals in the blueprint I am excited about, and I look forward to hearing from @SecAzar about others.The blueprint also proposes ending the so-called ‘gag-rule’ that prevents a pharmacist from telling a patient a drug would be cheaper if they paid out of pocket instead of with their insurance.Another action @US_FDA is considering is requiring drug manufacturers to include the list price of a drug in television commercials or other advertising materials.In President Trump’s blueprint, there are some steps the Administration has started to take or are intending to take. For example, @US_FDA is going to start going after bad actors gaming the system to delay generics from going to market.According to the  @KaiserFamFound, about half of Americans – that’s about 163 million people – take a prescription drug. And about one in eight Americans say it is difficult to afford those prescriptions.In May, President Trump announced a comprehensive blueprint to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. Today we are pleased to hear from @SecAzar to help us understand that blueprint and what the Administration plans to do to implement it and what legislation might be necessary.Today we are holding our fourth bipartisan hearing this Congress on drug pricing and we will hear from @HHSGov @SecAzar on @POTUS’s blueprint to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.About to chair our bipartisan HELP Committee hearing with @SecAzar on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. https://t.co/zyObD43A6jFollowing my visit to the @alexhaleymuseum, I spent time at the @librarycongress this morning looking over a recent donation of 1,000 items from Alex’s papers. I especially enjoyed a 1965 letter from his father, Simon, who was helping Alex with his early research for “Roots.” https://t.co/odIGRdJ2anDemocrats are not at the table; they are hiding under the table. Insurance premiums are rising again because of a law that Democrats enacted, voted not to repeal and replace, and refuse to fix.Democrats voted for the Hyde compromise more than 100 times in the Omnibus spending bill to which Republicans wanted to attach the 40 percent reduction in rates.In March, Democrats used the excuse of not wanting to vote for the traditional Hyde compromise on regulating federal abortion spending that Democrats have voted for every year since 1976.What I do not know how to do is to deal with Democrats who are unwilling to change a sentence in their Obamacare law even while a self-employed contractor making $60,000 might be paying $15,000 or $20,000 for health insurance.I know how to be bipartisan and how to get results.As chairman of the Senate’s health and education committee, I have worked with Democrats to solve big differences. We fixed No Child Left Behind, enacted 21st Century Cures, and unanimously approved legislation to combat the opioids epidemic.In March, Democrats blocked a proposal that President Trump and Republicans offered to enact that experts at Oliver Wyman health consulting firm said would lower premiums by up to 40 percent over three years.Rates in Tennessee have risen over 176 percent since every Democrat (and no Republican) voted for Obamacare in 2010. Last year, every Democrat voted against repealing and replacing Obamacare which would have given Americans more choices of insurance at lower cost.Health insurance premiums are skyrocketing again and Democrats are scrambling to blame the increases on someone else. They should look in the mirror.Today, @SecretaryPerry and @ENERGY announced that @ORNL has built the world’s most powerful supercomputer. This is further proof that Oak Ridge’s scientific brainpower, energy research and technological capabilities are some of the best in the world. https://t.co/jL4krrrnOnThree great music festivals happening right now in Tennessee.

My hope is we can approve the bill today so the whole Senate can quickly consider it..@SenatorBurr, who authored the original legislation in 2006 and led the first reauthorization effort in 2013, along with @SenBobCasey, have again worked hard on this bipartisan reauthorization..@SenAlexander: The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act authorizes programs that protect Americans from 21st century threats, including natural disasters, bioterror attacks, or infectious disease outbreaks, like a pandemic flu or Ebola.Today the House passed the #RightToTry legislation, which had bipartisan support in the HELP committee. The legislation that is headed to @POTUS’s desk will allow seriously ill patients to request access to experimental medicines that have yet to be approved by the @US_FDA. https://t.co/6WDkIh70W1Today the Senate health committee, which I chair, held a bipartisan hearing to learn how the federal government can help reduce shortages of health care professionals in rural areas. https://t.co/hnVbCxLKtO https://t.co/rjQM9winj0I would tell @POTUS and @OMBPress that science, research and innovation is what made America first, and I recommend that the president add science, research and innovation to his “America First” agenda. This appropriations bill is a good first step toward doing that.The bill also provides $6.927 billion for the @USACEHQ to maintain and rebuild our nation’s waterways, including up to $99.5 million to fully fund construction at Chickamauga Lock for the fifth consecutive year. https://t.co/tvqA1vQ47BThis funding bill will also modernize our nuclear weapons facilities at @y12nsc and accelerate cleanup of the East Tennessee Technology Park, @ORNL and the Y-12 National Security Complex. https://t.co/tvqA1vQ47BToday, the Senate Appropriations subcommittee I chair approved legislation that provides the 4th year of record funding for @ENERGY's 17 national laboratories, including @ORNL. https://t.co/tvqA1vQ47B https://t.co/hLcXnY4gu1Today the House passed the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, a bill that had bipartisan support in the @GOPHELP Committee and supports pediatric cancer research including at @StJude.Today I chaired a bipartisan Senate health committee hearing focused on this problem: as our population grows older, the gap between the number of us who need health care and the number who are there to provide health care gets bigger and bigger. https://t.co/GfbRUDjPHYHAPPENING NOW https://t.co/hLcXnY4gu1Listen in today at 2:30 PM EDT as I chair the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee markup of the fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill: https://t.co/E6TW4cWObRToday, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approved John Ryder to serve on the @TVAnews Board of Directors. John is the right person to help keep TVA on a good path, and I hope he will be quickly considered and confirmed by the Senate. https://t.co/3Zu8UBl04vWe need to know if what the federal government currently is doing is effective or if specific improvements should be made. Do we need all of these programs, or should there be changes to better meet the needs of patients?And finally, we spend about $310 million for the National Health Service Corps, which provides loan repayment for primary care doctors who go to work in under-served areas.  Most of these doctors choose to work at the 10,000 community health centers across the country.Second, we spend over $1B on about 70 different health workforce programs that provide scholarships and loan repayment for students, faculty, and health care professionals in exchange for working in rural areas. All of these programs are within the HELP committee’s jurisdiction.First, about $10 billion goes to Medicare Graduate Medical Education Programs, which funds resident training for new doctors. That program is in the jurisdiction of the Finance committeeThe federal government is currently doing three things to help reduce and prevent shortages of health care workers.The shortage affects certain populations more than others. In 2014, the @acognews reported that 47 rural Tennessee counties, out of 95 total, had no OB-GYN. That means a couple may have to travel to Memphis, Nashville or Knoxville to see an OB-GYN.According to the @ruralhealth, there are only 39 primary care doctors for every 100,000 people living in rural areas, but there are 53 primary care doctors for every 100,000 people in urban areas.We know that the shortage of health care professionals – which includes doctors, nurses, paramedics, and x-ray technicians – is a problem that has the potential to keep getting worse.Today’s bipartisan hearing is an opportunity to learn about the growing shortage of health care professionals – especially in rural areas – and better understand where health care professionals are choosing to work so we can start addressing shortages across the country.I will continue to tell the president that NAFTA has been good for Tennessee, and I look forward to working with Ambassador Lighthizer to help make sure that changes to NAFTA do not hurt workers or consumers.Changes to NAFTA could make it more expensive to build cars in Tennessee, threatening thousands of jobs in 88 counties, and make it harder for businesses and farmers to export their products.Today I along w/ 31 Republican senators sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer urging him not to give Congress an ultimatum on changing NAFTA that could jeopardize American jobs and economic growth: https://t.co/4AtkoiNsqbWATCH @WCTE’s “One on One” with @beckymagura here —&gt; https://t.co/7iSAeMw4D7Tune in to @WCTE tonight at 7:30 PM EDT for my conversation with @beckymagura about what I am working on in Washington for Tennesseans..@CNN got this right: Memphis is the best place in the world to visit in May! https://t.co/JDQCpQNsu0 Hope everyone is enjoying the @memphisinmay festivities.

Enjoy your trip to Washington! https://t.co/aa7JrOGRRYSince @POTUS took office last January, the Republican Senate majority has confirmed 21 U.S. Circuit Court judges – President H.W.

We should work together on the bipartisan bill I’ve introduced with @SenAngusKing to help pay for the backlog. https://t.co/E33Z2GCbPhI believe that as Tennesseans continue to experience bigger paychecks thanks to #TaxReform, our economy will continue to grow.

Bush. #ConfirmPizzellaPresident Barack Obama appointed Patrick Pizzella to be a member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority in August 2013, which required Senate confirmation and he was confirmed by voice vote on October 16, 2013. #ConfirmPizzella.@ENERGY’s research programs have made the United States a world leader in science and technology, and these programs will help the United States maintain its brainpower advantage to remain competitive at a time when other countries are investing heavily in research.We must focus on supercomputing, nuclear weapons modernization, and keeping major construction projects – like the Uranium Processing Facility in Oak Ridge -- on time and on budget. https://t.co/u2w8pf8LHlHad a good conversation this morning with @BobCusack for #TheHillNewsmaker Series.
