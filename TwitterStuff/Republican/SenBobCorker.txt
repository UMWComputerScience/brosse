My full statement: https://t.co/0ctxBsBQpl.Tariffs are a tax on the American people. The harm being done to the U.S. economy, businesses and consumers will only get worse. We will continue to fight for a vote on the Corker-@SenToomey tariff amendment. My floor remarks yesterday: https://t.co/ByD3Rrw5Uz.Thank you, Justice Kennedy, for a lifetime of distinguished service. It is my hope that the president will quickly nominate a well-qualified individual who understands the importance of upholding the Constitution and applying the law in a fair and independent manner.More than 270 business and agriculture groups today sent a letter urging my colleagues to support legislation I authored with @SenToomey to require congressional approval of national security-designated tariffs.

It’s now up to us in Congress to work with them to come up with a longer-term solution. https://t.co/0FBpjrhnd4A tariff is a tax on Americans, and I don’t know of a senator that isn’t concerned about the broad use of these national security-designated tariffs. I think a jailbreak is brewing in the Senate on the need to reassert constitutional authority on trade policy. https://t.co/9GdmLwwfSFIn case you missed it, I joined @margbrennan on @FaceTheNation yesterday to discuss trade and immigration policy.

My statement on the administration's proposal to sell TVA transmission lines: https://t.co/AfN1MsK5zb.I think most Tennesseans would agree that we are fortunate not to have a state income tax, and to help ensure that remains the case, it is important our sales tax system works. Today’s ruling is a win for states’ rights. My full statement: https://t.co/0CMag8nhLe. https://t.co/wT8CHNewtIThe president should reverse his decision to implement tariffs under the guise of national security. If he doesn’t, Congress must act and should start by passing our bipartisan legislation.I believe pressure is building in Washington and across the country as American businesses and consumers begin to feel the effects of the administration’s misguided trade policy.This week, I called on the administration to halt family separations, so I am glad the president reversed his position and signed an executive order. We will continue to work toward a long term solution.This is good news for self-employed individuals and the millions of Americans who work for small businesses.

See what they are saying: https://t.co/JJ0MIyszI4.Today, we introduced bipartisan legislation requiring the president to submit to Congress any proposal to adjust imports in the interest of national security under Section 232. Press release and bill text available here: https://t.co/v1vAYz1RrJIf the president truly believes invoking Section 232 is necessary to protect the United States from a genuine threat, he should make the case to Congress and to the American people and do the hard work necessary to secure congressional approval.Making claims regarding national security to justify what is inherently an economic question not only harms the very people we all want to help and impairs relations with our allies but also could invite our competitors to retaliate.While we all agree on the need to ensure the international trade system is fair for American workers, companies and consumers, unfortunately, the administration is abusing the Section 232 authority delegated to the president by Congress.Enjoyed welcoming 100+ Tennesseans to Capitol Hill yesterday at our weekly constituent breakfast.

Our young people and their children are going to pay for it. https://t.co/g4LJdUsZaPHowever, the #omnibus is a grotesque piece of legislation. We’re engaged right now in generational theft because we are transferring from young people, to us, their future resources because we don’t have the courage or the will to deal with these issues. https://t.co/h2b86PVxv6While I could not be more discouraged about where we are today with our adult leadership here in Washington, I am optimistic about the future because of the young people around our country.

They raised unmitigated H-E-L-L over tax reform potentially creating some deficits if the growth projections didn’t occur. I have not heard a word from them about the fact that we’re adding $2 trillion in debt. Not a word. #omnibus https://t.co/LgMfKYEblDFor the Republican Party to have the presidency and Congress and be in a situation where we pass a bill that adds $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years has to be a wake-up call to people. #omnibus https://t.co/hObU7ZJkhcWe voted on a 2,232-page bill last night that is going to add – there’s no question – a minimum of $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years. #omnibus https://t.co/YZAVhfiNR2Without extreme leadership at the very top, I do not think we will deal with this fiscal issue until there’s a crisis because I just don’t see the will in Washington to do the things that need to be done. https://t.co/OfrPRAdO0sWhen I ran for the Senate, I ran concerned about our nation’s fiscal issues. And I ran on the combination of pro-growth tax reform and entitlement reform and dealing with the tremendous deficits that our country has.
