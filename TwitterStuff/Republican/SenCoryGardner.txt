She is a a well-qualified jurist, mainstream conservative, &amp; someone who will take the cases where the law leads her &amp; not try to legislate from the bench.I sent a letter to @realDonaldTrump today urging him to nominate Judge Allison Eid to fill Justice Kennedy's seat. Judge Eid currently serves on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Colorado.I wish him the best of luck in this next chapter of his remarkable life.I want to thank Justice Kennedy for his years of service on the Supreme Court. Since President Reagan appointed him from the court of appeals more than 30 years ago, Justice Kennedy has carefully and thoughtfully approached each case that has come before him.In Colorado we are proud of our fourteeners, our forests, and our national parks.

Children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents, &amp; that’s exactly what is happening right now.Caitlyn had a blast fishing today.

The blame for today’s distrust and tensions between Moscow &amp; Washington lies entirely with the Kremlin and its atrocious behavior.
https://t.co/aWsS31Uk3KRussia has invaded its neighbors Georgia and Ukraine, it supports the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad and our enemies in Afghanistan, and it is engaged in active information warfare against Western democracies, including meddling in the 2016 United States elections.The State Department should consider adding Russia to its list of state sponsors of terrorism, alongside its close allies Iran and Syria.

Pompeo response: Yes sir, that is correct.
 
My colleagues can all surely agree with this. https://t.co/cbQH0RBdWvIf some of my colleagues are concerned that Pompeo is holding high level talks w/ NK because that’s a role of a Secretary of State, they should act quickly and confirm him.

Excited for my hometown teams!I'll be joining @TubbsShow on 710KNUS at 5:30pm MT today to discuss the latest on North Korea. Be sure to tune in here: https://t.co/hY7hLW9I9LWe must verify BEFORE we trust. The stakes are high. @POTUS can change the course of history, but it must be done through a position of strength and be consistent with long-standing U.S. policy and national security goals. 11/11Kim Jong Un must know that we will not hesitate to protect the U.S. homeland, our troops in the region, and our treaty allies, with overwhelming military force, if necessary. 10/11In the meantime, as I wrote in my letter yesterday with my colleagues on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committee, sanctions and joint military exercises w/ our allies must continue.
https://t.co/zPfjhOsZqc
9/11As a starting point for any negotiations, we must demand that the regime adheres to the commitments it has already made to the United States to denuclearize, and has since repeatedly violated. 8/11My new bipartisan bill, the LEED Act, would impose an economic embargo on North Korea and its enablers, wherever they are based. You can read more about it here: https://t.co/OaTnLg9Nab
7/11The maximum pressure campaign that my legislation started, and President Trump has continued, has brought us to this point today. Now we need to keep up the pressure and negotiate from a position of strength. 6/11But we haven’t received any of these commitments from North Korea to date. 5/11Per U.S. law, the President must demand that NK make significant progress toward complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization &amp; comply with all UN Security Council Resolutions before any sanctions relief or normalization of relations with NK can be considered. 4/11This legislation, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, was signed into law in February 2016. It now forms the basis of the maximum pressure campaign against North Korea. The law sets a high bar for any lifting of sanctions on North Korea. See below. 3/11 https://t.co/H1MUWHygI4As Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee focused on East Asia policy, I held a series of hearings and began working on legislation that would require mandatory sanctions on the regime and would set parameters for U.S. policy toward North Korea. 2/11THREAD: When I was sworn in to the Senate in 2015, I referred to Kim Jong Un as the “Forgotten Maniac”. At the time, few were paying attention to the grave threat posed by NK to the US and our allies, while the Obama Admin. followed a failing policy of “strategic patience”. 1/11I sent a letter to the President today urging him to continue his maximum pressure campaign &amp; I do not think this announcement should change US resolve until DPRK takes concrete steps toward full denuclearization. You can read my full letter here: https://t.co/zPfjhOsZqc
3/3Kim Jong Un must take concrete steps toward total denuclearization and President Trump must demand it. 2/3The price of admission for a meeting between @POTUS and Kim Jong Un must be the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 1/3Thanks to Manufacturer’s Edge and other Colorado manufacturers for stopping by my office today to discuss cybersecurity and how we can continue to grow the economy. https://t.co/59ayV4csVBInvesting tax savings in its employees and lowering prices for customers -- tax relief continues to work for Coloradans. #TaxCutsAndJobsAct https://t.co/fxOhfVo8MOThanks for stopping by! https://t.co/skoFvaxnq3I spoke with @SecretaryZinke today about my continued efforts to move the Bureau of Land Management headquarters West and appreciate his work with me on this issue. https://t.co/hO7eJbHkaKI had the honor of presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star, and Air Medal to Fort Collins resident Robert Thydean for his heroic service during the Vietnam War.

We must continue to take every diplomatic &amp; economic measure to stop NK &amp; prevent nuclear war.

Tune in! https://t.co/j7si9NeP43I am heartbroken for the students &amp; family of those involved in this horrible tragedy &amp; I'm praying for our first responders as they act swiftly to contain the situation. https://t.co/rCn5lFYhHPOur immigration system is broken &amp; we need to fix it. Coloradans expect @SenBennetCO &amp; I to work together &amp; that’s exactly what we have done.

But it's a good thing the pros at @usacurl are representing us in #PyeongChang2018. https://t.co/UAkj61yf5mIs the "newspaper of record" really this susceptible to charm and propaganda from murderous dictatorships?

Reminder: there are currently over 100,000 prisoners enslaved in North Korea. https://t.co/ffbmafH4B3Colorado's own Red Gerard was the first athlete to bring home the Gold for @TeamUSA at the #Olympics2018. Congrats to Red and good luck to the rest of @TeamUSA. I know you will make us all proud.
https://t.co/uDZltvbsLsMy North Korea sanctions bill with @SenMarkey would impose an economic embargo on North Korea and its enablers: https://t.co/heX5cD1ktTI agree with the @VP.

Glad @realDonaldTrump agrees GTMO is tailor-made for terrorists.Walking to the House chamber with my fellow Senators. #SOTU https://t.co/orZbeTD6ZAWe should continue to work toward a bipartisan compromise for Dreamers. #SOTU (7/7)Our men and women in uniform sacrifice everything to keep us safe. It's our duty to ensure they receive the high-level of care they deserve when they return home from the battlefield. #SOTU (6/7)#NorthKorea still poses a great threat to our country and we must continue to apply maximum pressure to achieve peaceful denuclearization of Kim Jong Un's rogue regime. #SOTU (5/7)Colorado's roads are in disrepair and need major upgrades. A national infrastructure plan would be good for Colorado and good for America. #SOTU (4/7)While urban areas along the Front Range are doing well, the forgotten corners of our state and country are not seeing the same level of success. We need a strong plan for rural economic development that includes broadband deployment to help close the #digitaldivide. #SOTU (3/7)Tax cuts have already resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment and growing wages. Let’s continue to grow the economy and reduce the burden of Washington on hardworking Americans. #SOTU (2/7)I look forward to hearing from the President tonight and hope he addresses a few key policy areas I’ve outlined below that are important to Colorado. #SOTU (1/7)I spent Friday morning at the Colorado State Capitol celebrating Military Appreciation Day. It’s always an honor to speak with veterans and our men and women in uniform and thank them for their incredible sacrifice. https://t.co/Cb1R8k3wxdI had a great time touring the @OutdoorRetailer show with @SenBennetCO today.
