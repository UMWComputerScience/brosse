Hey @Newseum - thanks for the great exhibit &amp; for featuring the powerful photo of Bob Thom, known in Alaska as 'Cajun Bob' one of the many heroes who live in my state. For all: Please visit the Newseum and check out the #MarinesandTet exhibit! https://t.co/bW78M7Dy1bI would like to thank Justice Kennedy for his years of service to our nation and for his unwavering commitment to civility.

https://t.co/9MdxTi5pBtHonored #SecDef Mattis accepted my invitation to visit AK to meet our remarkable men &amp; women in uniform &amp; see firsthand a number of our military assets &amp; missions. Extremely valuable visit, one that allowed #SecDef to gain more robust understanding of AK geostrategic location https://t.co/oVfci4b5V6Hats off the men and women of the USCGC Alex Haley, homeported in Kodiak, for their steadfast work to intercept and detain this vessel suspected of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. 
https://t.co/lhUsi3reKkHonored to host #SecDef Mattis in Interior Alaska to highlight a number of important missions and military assets, including air combat capabilities at Eielson AFB and America's missile defense at Ft. Greely https://t.co/MLPnyrs5T5Yesterday, I traveled to AK w/ #SecDef Jim Mattis to begin a 2 day tour to show him firsthand how AK constitutes 3 pillars of military might: cornerstone of  missile defense, hub of air combat for Asia Pacific, vital  platform for expeditionary forces. Stayed tuned! https://t.co/B1mjaXzTFuWhile @POTUS has now addressed family separation administratively, it’s important to recognize these types of ‘executive fixes’ to our immigration laws are often temporary &amp; not sustainable. A bipartisan, enduring solution by Congress is needed. My stmnt

https://t.co/pXIvGUP3rsSenate-passed NDAA continues the process of rebuilding our military, in addition to recognizing that AK's military capabilities play an important role in our national defense as global threats increase. 
https://t.co/U3UjorJIuq https://t.co/6XxV3RVBWBSenate-passed NDAA contains provision stating the removal of U.S. forces from the Korea Peninsula “is a non-negotiable item as it relates to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization” of North Korea. Glad to see @WSJopinion agreed
https://t.co/olTd8SXF4CIn addition to historic opening of ANWR, Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Act is having a huge impact on the American economy, including job creation, economic growth, higher wages &amp; reductions to utility rates -- something @JuneauEmpire   highlighted in this recent piece
https://t.co/3KW8V45bXj.@WSJ Editorial Board piece -- "The Senate's Nuclear Insurance" in support of my missile defense provision within the FY19 NDAA, describes the important next steps we need to take to further strengthen our national security.

We wish him &amp; his family peace.Once again, we come to you directly from Washington, D.C. to discuss some of issues and happenings in Congress this week.
https://t.co/MvXQNb6lQf@NBCNightlyNews recently visited Fort Greely to tour our nation’s missile defense systems and meet with the remarkable men and women of the 49th Missile Defense Battalion. 
https://t.co/kQ23i82X1EIntegrated Missile Defense Act of 2018, included in the Senate Armed Services Committee-passed NDAA, furthers our nation’s efforts to dramatically bolster and advance our nation’s missile defense systems. https://t.co/6K3p5jkRPq https://t.co/N3PTelbaM2Today we honor the thousands of brave troops who stormed the beaches of Normandy – Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword – to begin the liberation of Western Europe from the clutches of tyranny and to preserve freedom for generations to come. We are forever grateful! https://t.co/9ISvHYcoArToday’s vote in the Senate Indian Affairs Committee moves Tara Sweeney one step closer to becoming our next Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, an extremely important position not only for Alaska but the nation. https://t.co/LF2itKszlS https://t.co/tnCqeu2HbPSaddened to hear of the passing of legendary Yup’ik translator &amp; storyteller John Active.

Congrats Chike! https://t.co/HqWVWRy7u9Welcome home to JBER's 4-25! The Spartan Brigade officially returned Wednesday night from their 9-month deployment in Afghanistan. We thank these brave men and women for their service and we thank their families for their enduring sacrifice as well. https://t.co/PmKGsPzrtOToday's announcement -- new tariffs against key U.S. allies -- undermines the administration's own China strategy. Bad move. Our allies must play a critical role to combat China's unfair practices. See my full statement:
https://t.co/lcNvHXvK81I believe the greatest tribute we can show our fallen is to honor their memory by not squandering their legacy. #SemperFiAs we spend Memorial Day remembering the fallen, let’s also remember to pray for those young men and women from Alaska and across our great country who are in harm’s way fighting freedom's battle. https://t.co/k8HuFjpq5YAnd while there is never a perfect solution, this legislation is built around an overwhelming belief that our veterans should be receiving the best care available to them.As a nation, we owe our veterans and their families a great deal of gratitude and debt. This bill is a small step in the right direction to ensure our VA is responsive to their needs, accountable for their actions and prepared to fulfill this nation’s promises.While many of these solutions we done administratively, it was imperative to solidify them into law.This included efforts to pull scheduling back to Alaskans within the VA, allow for the continuation of very successful tribal sharing agreements; and ensuring community providers in Alaska are fairly compensated at rates reflecting the high cost of healthcare in our state.Throughout this process, I worked to ensure this bill properly recognizes that AK’s VA system has &amp; continues to be unique. Building upon the lessons learned from the failed implementation of the VA Choice Act, we fought hard to protect the progress made in AK in recent years.Today I proudly voted for the VA MISSION Act, which modernizes the way the VA approaches healthcare. It’s built on the idea – one that we continue to champion in Alaska – that no matter where our veterans live they have the right to prompt, quality care close to home.Yesterday, I joined @theDaveStierenShow to offer a brief congressional update and discuss a variety of issues important to Alaskans.

https://t.co/wXZFenQvHr https://t.co/xs0rwLbTeeGood news – the Right to Try Act, which passed the House yesterday, is headed to the President’s desk. This legislation gives patients with a terminal illness the right to pursue experimental drugs or equipment, even if the odds are long. 
https://t.co/HkZIEilozVI join countless Alaskans in welcoming this announcement, which begins the necessary process of reversing an unlawful regulatory action by the National Park Service and restoring the unique management relationship between Alaska and the federal government

//bit.ly/2wQDFhV https://t.co/6jn5KTbiQY#NationalPoliceWeek is a somber reminder of the courage and tireless devotion our law enforcement, AK Troopers, and first responders display each and every day. We are forever grateful for their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/vaCjnb3bxS https://t.co/0GKCUCkG8QI commend the Trump Admin for implementing the bipartisan will of the Congress to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem — something that many other presidents committed to, but failed to follow through on. The future of U.S.-Israeli relationships is stronger and brighter than ever.Today’s ceremony on the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel demonstrates the unshakable bond between the United States and Israel — not just the bond between our governments, but more importantly, our people.As to the White House official who offered such an insult, she should show some respect and apologize.Making light of this – especially in the senseless and classless manner that’s been described in the media – is simply sad and speaks more broadly to the low levels of civil discourse &amp; respect that have infected our politics on both sides of the aisle. We all need to do better..@SenJohnMcCain is a great American, a close friend &amp; mentor of mine in the Senate. Like millions of Americans, my family &amp; I continue to pray for this American hero as he bravely battles cancer, &amp; is again showing the courage and fighting spirit for which he is widely regarded.As the week comes to a close, I wanted to share a brief recap on the many activities and developments in Washington, D.C.

These gatherings are extremely insightful, particularly as we work on rural infrastructure, econ development, the shortcomings facing our vets &amp; so much more. https://t.co/HhcRg7o4FLThis designation will make a huge difference as local, state &amp; fed stakeholders work to counter-drug trafficking operations &amp; combat the growing opioid/heroin epidemic sweeping our state. I look forward to highlighting #HIDTA and work of @ONDCP @ my upcoming Summit on crime. https://t.co/LJdlzxxcqZI'm pleased to announce an upcoming community meet and greet in Bethel, AK next Monday, April 30th from 7 to 8:30 pm at the VFW Post 10041.

As the wife and mother of presidents, she was the role model for millions, epitomizing grace, dignity and spirit. #BarbaraBushToday, I addressed the North America’s Building Trade Unions 2018 Legislative Conference where I outlined a number of bipartisan priorities in Congress to streamline permitting and put American men and women back to work building projects and infrastructure across the country. https://t.co/YajkGeCmIeToday – Tax Day – marks the last time Americans will file their taxes under the old, outdated &amp; often burdensome system. Today, I outlined some of the many important provisions in the new, simpler tax law signed in December  https://t.co/IrNKnP8sA8 https://t.co/e2ROUfSPskMoving forward, we must not only work with our NATO partners, but also our Arab and Israeli allies to develop a comprehensive and sustained strategy for advancing our immediate and long-term national security interests in Syria and the broader Middle East.I commend these decisive actions and offer my prayers to the brave men and women conducting these operations this evening.This response against Syria’s chemical weapons infrastructure was both measured and warranted, and a necessary step to deter future chemical weapons attacks, whether against innocent men, women and children or our troops deployed in the Middle East.The precision military strikes launched this evening, in partnership with our British and French allies, send a clear and concise message to the Assad regime: the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.This week we honor Bethel resident John Active, legendary Yup’ik storyteller and decades long voice of KYUK public media, as part of my “Alaskan of the Week” series.

Let's get something on the books.5) So which are you, are you a tech company or are you the world’s largest publisher? Because I think that goes to a really important question on what form of regulation or government action, if any, we would take.4) Do you think there's a risk given your influence that if we regulate we’re actually going to regulate you into a position of cemented authority?3) When companies become big and powerful, and accumulate a lot of wealth and power, what typically happens from this body is there’s an instinct to either regulate or break up, right?…Do you have any thoughts on those two policy approaches?2) Facebook – 2 billion users, over 200 million Americans, $40 billion in revenue. I believe you and Google have almost 75% of the digital advertising in the U.S. One of the key issues here, is Facebook too powerful?1) Quite a story right – dorm room to the global behemoth that you guys are. Only in America, would you agree with that?Today, I asked CEO Mark Zuckerberg five questions surrounding the growth and market dominance of Facebook https://t.co/CZKsKeA7YT https://t.co/Y4G8SBceayI congratulate Jon Katchen on being nominated to serve on the federal bench for the District of Alaska.

McMaster has served his country for over 34 years with integrity, courage and with an exceptional warrior spirit. He exemplifies the best of what a military officer stands for.The fact that human sex trafficking is problem in America, shocks most people. The fact that it’s a growing issue – by over 800% – is unbelievable.

Importantly, I want to share directly with you a few updates from Washington, D.C. – specifically how we got to this point and a possible path forward.

https://t.co/HIdnVKFWYLYesterday, the Minority Leader had a choice. Sadly, he decided to turn a manufactured crisis into a government shutdown. https://t.co/2BDeNxYmwmAs work continues, I am hopeful that we can find a solution to reopen the government.  The American people, particularly our veterans &amp; troops, deserve better. My office stands ready to assist Alaskans, including those negatively impacted by this unnecessary government shutdown.I simply fail to understand the logic behind the Minority Leader’s decision to shut down the govt. Passage of the CR tonight would have continued the essential functions of govt, provided funding for CHIP &amp; given Congress an opportunity to address a long term spending measure.The bipartisan bill we considered tonight, which funded the government until February 16th, was voted down not for the items it contained, but for what was not included – a long term agreement on immigration for which we still have weeks to resolve.Tonight, we saw a manufactured crisis officially turn into a government shutdown – something that was absolutely preventable.The bill before us prevents a government shutdown, funds CHIP for six years and delays a number of harmful Obamacare taxes. While a resolution on immigration reform is important, funding the government must take priority.While I believe a resolution on immigration reform – one that includes an increase in border security – should occur, keeping the government open and operational must take priority.The short-term funding measure currently before us, which I support, contains numerous provisions that enjoy nearly universal backing in Alaska and Congress – including a six year extension of CHIP and delays to Obamacare’s Cadillac and Medical Device taxes.Yet tonight, in the face of a government shutdown, the Senate Minority Leader is now emphasizing an issue he has rarely focused on – rebuilding our military – while failing to mention his primary reason for shutting down the govt – a lack of an agreement on immigration reform.For months, Congress has worked to debate and negotiate a long term spending measure – one that appropriately supports our men and women in uniform, establishes policies that grow our economy, and tackles a series of leading national priorities.The only thing worse than another Continuing Resolution – particularly for our military and veterans – is a government shutdown.https://t.co/AXi52iplflGiven the critical importance of this issue, today I asked the Secretary of Veteran Affairs to speak directly efforts being made to stem the tide of veterans suicide and better prevent and treat mental illness. https://t.co/1QKs4YJYt2Former Senator Bob Dole has dedicated his life to service, country and advocating on behalf of others. Today, we honor him with the highest civilian honor – the Congressional Gold Medal – as a “soldier, legislator and statesman." https://t.co/AnZdWhdJRdhttps://t.co/i1ptEduRhlCongrats again to my friend and colleagues @RepDonYoung for becoming Dean of the House. https://t.co/j3BWUGeBJoI applaud @POTUS EO to expand mental health benefits &amp; care for our veterans.It’s our obligation to pursue all of the causes and all of the factors that contribute to the scourge of veteran suicide, and bring it to an end. https://t.co/aXaHcLgUaoWhen I look out at 2018, I am struck by one overriding feeling for our state: optimism. There are numerous reasons for this. Read my op-ed on the many positive things happening for Alaska and the nation --https://t.co/cawtWSIviv https://t.co/ldqClmtzqAHistoric tax bill is all about jobs, growing the economy &amp; allowing middle class families to keep more of their hard earned dollars. It's already having a real impact, w/ businesses across the country reinvesting in their employees &amp; in their communities. https://t.co/p52L9Go1iSEarlier today, I spoke with @DanaPerino on a number of issues, including North Korea, military readiness, and the recent change to federal marijuana enforcement policy.

https://t.co/qkkn2XLkuR https://t.co/zHEVUF7lEZhttps://t.co/uqnKdvZxxLHappy Birthday Alaska! Fifty nine years ago — as a result of tremendous work by Alaskans and allies across the country — Alaska became the 49th state to join the Union. https://t.co/EjHbfrfwPO@OrrinHatch is a true American statesman who has represented the state of Utah with dignity &amp; grace for over four decades. He has also been a steady and strong friend to Alaska. I'm proud to call him my colleague &amp; my friend. He'll be greatly missed.As protests in Iran continue, I share my support for the brave men and women who are speaking out against a corrupt regime and the leaders of the world's largest sponsor of state terrorism.Earlier today, @POTUS signed H.R. 1 into law -- opening ANWR's 1002 to responsible resource development and exploration. https://t.co/3vQ7yp5STkThis historic moment, opening ANWR to responsible resource development, is good for Alaska and good for the nation.
