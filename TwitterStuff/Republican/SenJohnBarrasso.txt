Millions of Americans found out that wasn’t true, let’s not dupe the American people again.And in Canada under its #SinglePayer system, Canadian doctor @docdanielle noted year-long wait times for care https://t.co/2cUnvbjxlwA few weeks ago, the UK National Health Service (which has a #MedicareForAll like system) had to cancel 50k surgeries because of overcrowding and claims that patients were being treated in “third world conditions” https://t.co/690VEFOEZYSocialized medicine like #MedicareForAll has a track record of challenge and failure..@SenSanders unveiled a #MedicareForAll AKA #SinglePayer proposal several months back. The idea is to put almost all Americans onto a new government-run Medicare-like program—giving Americans #ZEROchoice in their #healthcareTonight, @SenSanders will hold a town hall about #MedicareForAll. A new program that would be a total Washington take over everyone’s #healthcare in #zerochoice America.Thanks, Bernie. One big question: Why would government-run health care work better here than in the UK and Canada?  https://t.co/690VEFOEZY https://t.co/cZpVIwQriH.@SenSanders’ #SinglePayer bill would actually outlaw employer health coverage— Check out Section 107 of the bill he sponsored and 16 other @SenateDems cosponsored  https://t.co/OH1y7R9cG7 https://t.co/5NGyjXnNKjAccording to a @KaiserFamFound poll, among individuals who currently get their health insurance through an employer, nearly half (44 percent) INCORRECTLY believe they could keep their insurance if #SinglePayer was implemented https://t.co/1vgD4tCQ6wTonight @SenSanders will host a conversation about #MedicareForAll. @SenSanders if #MedicareForAll is implemented, how many people will lose their current coverage?
