Here are just a few photos from the evening. #SOTU https://t.co/jG6JWatXkTOn @FoxBusiness with @Varneyco now discussing the President’s first #SOTUIn studio at @CNN discussing the #SOTU with @ChrisCuomo now. Be sure to tune in! https://t.co/dJ2WBjnEeFThank you @POTUS for addressing the war on terrorism and a special thanks to our armed services for their hard work combatting ISIS.We are winning the war against ISIS. You can sleep a little better tonight knowing that we are making progress against pure evil. #SOTUWe must join together to fight the opioid epidemic. Only together we can win this battle. #SOTUWe need an immigration system that looks like it was designed on purpose. It's time to end the lottery visa program. #SOTUThank you, @POTUS for putting America first. #StateOfTheUnionIt is time we rebuild our nation's infrastructure. Upgrading our roads, bridges, and waterways will help move our economy forward. #SOTUWe have slashed through bureaucratic #RedTape to help save the American taxpayers $36 billion in compliance costs. #StateoftheUnion #SOTUWe are ensuring that our veterans get the quality health care they deserve from competent health care workers. #SOTURT, Mr. President. Our military deserves our unwavering support. #SOTU@exxonmobil is making huge investments because of tax reform. #SOTU 
https://t.co/DWb8fqUxU1The individual mandate is gone. It put cruel, crippling financial burdens on too many in this country. #SOTUThe outlook for our economy is better now than it was before Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I guarantee you that a month from now, for millions of Americans and their families, it will look even better. #StateoftheUnion #SOTU(1/2) It’s only been 40 days since @POTUS signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, and already we are beginning to see what meaningful tax relief looks like for middle and working class American families. #StateoftheUnionThank you for recognizing the #CajunNavy, @POTUS. #StateoftheUnion(2/2) One of Louisiana’s largest employers, @jpmorgan, has increased minimum wages &amp; expanded benefits for its hourly workers. They’ve planned a $20 billion, five-year domestic investment that’ll benefit those who own homes or small businesses, or those who would like to somedayI'm proud to take Calvin Franklin as my guest to the #StateOfTheUnion. He works hard behind the scenes at the Senate &amp; deserves a front row seat to history unfolding. I’m excited that he'll be able to enjoy this moment &amp; look forward to hearing what he thinks about the experience https://t.co/vfLnj2EYdFHappy birthday, @RepMikeJohnson!We are one of only seven countries, including China and North Korea, that allows abortions after 20 weeks. By not allowing this bill to be voted on, Senate Democrats have shown a disregard for the preciousness of human life.  That is disgraceful. #TheyFeelPain https://t.co/hv3VF7bpqMWaters of the United States, #WOTUS, is a federal overreach that places unnecessary burdens on Louisiana’s farmers. The federal government doesn't need to be worried about the pond in my backyard. https://t.co/2RpddNFI65I am proud to have supported such an invaluable project. These funds will help Louisiana move our country one step closer towards energy independence. 

https://t.co/csWgGRDx1kThis afternoon I spoke to members of Louisiana’s Committee of 100. One thing we can all agree on is that you can’t be for jobs if you are against business. https://t.co/kv8nCINGpWBoom! Comcast, Walmart, Boeing, and now Disney. All of these employees are benefiting because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Can’t wait to see which company is next.  https://t.co/31xrsT4lXcWe need to have a serious discussion about immigration. We need to put all the chips on the table and talk about the entire problem including border security, chain migration, the diversity visa lottery, and inland security to name a few; then we can talk about amnesty. https://t.co/twl7OYlDF6Tune in to @CNN now to hear me discuss the latest on government funding with @BrookeBCNN.What I watched unfold last night was bone-deep stupid. There was no reason to shut down government. People are being scared for no reason. https://t.co/C7xgCaypr4This shutdown is an embarrassment that puts kids and our military last instead of first. #SchumerShutdownProud to see so many Louisianans and people from across the country participate in today’s #MarchForLife. Life is precious. https://t.co/6aGAFWMVC6Tune in to @CNN @NewDay now to hear me discuss the latest with government funding. https://t.co/bs9hodQWv5Today is the 45th annual #MarchforLife. I firmly believe that every life is a precious gift from the Lord, whether it's 84 years old or 84 seconds old. I want to thank everyone who marches for those who can’t stand up for themselves, just yet. https://t.co/bQnZHjPEnFWe’ve got to impose a Medicaid work requirement for able-bodied adults. This will help them and Louisiana. The money for Medicaid is coming out of the hide of education, public safety, and roads.
https://t.co/AcgRNgzGISTune in to @FoxNews right now to hear me talk about the latest with #CHIP and government funding. https://t.co/WdZMpglGsSThis evening I told @chucktodd on @MSNBC: We don't have a budget. That's an embarrassing fact...I would like to do a budget by Friday. https://t.co/2NHFOcgKZKTune in live now to @MeetThePress to hear me discuss government funding.Happy to welcome some of the best and brightest students from four of Louisiana’s high schools to D.C. today. These students are from Mount Carmel Academy, Edward Douglas White Catholic High School, Loyola College Prep, and C.E. Byrd High School. https://t.co/qbdlBYXA03This was a tough loss for everyone in Louisiana.  This is the saddest I’ve ever been holding a king cake, but I’m happy to introduce @amyklobuchar to our Mardi Gras traditions. cc: @Saints @Vikings https://t.co/2V4PJ25ZqCGov. Edward’s tax increases are driving companies and industries out of Louisiana so much so that other governors are taking notice. Louisiana needs a competitive business environment so we can grow more jobs and the economy. https://t.co/dKdmGyNvDJToday, we remember the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  We must continue to work together to make sure Dr. King’s dream is fully realized. https://t.co/e8FMwkCalZWho dat?! Let’s go @Saints!I have no doubts the @Saints will beat the @Vikings this Sunday. I'm so confident that we'll win, I bet @amyklobuchar a king cake. I’m going to make good on the bet regardless of the game’s outcome. At least having a king cake will make it easier to stomach a loss this weekend. https://t.co/nevxXvrtfHToday I #WearBlue, to increase awareness on how to recognize and report human trafficking. https://t.co/nKLhC5fjhUThinking about @SteveScalise today as he undergoes further surgery. Steve, you and your family are in my prayers. https://t.co/GanEm24N3ETalking with @ChrisCuomo on @CNN now!On @CNN this evening talking with @andersoncooper.Today is #NationalLawEnforcementDay. Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to ensure the safety of our families and communities. It's important today, and every day, to express gratitude to all of our law enforcement professionals. https://t.co/t8mjuuc6gsOn @FoxBusiness this morning talking about the Fix NICS Act.Big game today!  Let’s go @Saints! #WhoDat #whodatnation https://t.co/UGeFiOwsoyThis is an extraordinary moment for American energy. We are one giant step closer towards energy independence. This means more jobs and opportunities for our oilfield families in Louisiana and around the country that have been hit hard over the past several years. https://t.co/U5JLkXQfWRCHIP will be reauthorized. It's a worthwhile program for children and mothers in LA, and across the U.S. It should be a crime to tell people it’s in danger when it’s not. It’s like telling people that you’re going to cancel LSU Football unless they pay higher taxes. https://t.co/l9WbRF8xdfOn @CNN this morning talking about the #2018 legislative agenda.In Case You Missed It: 90% of the middle class is going to receive a tax cut. https://t.co/gDXtpCIskcLet’s #GeauxTigers!!! https://t.co/JVUU52FMxxHave a Happy New Year, Louisiana! #2018 https://t.co/E7UHQHCXpYInterested to see how much money you’ll save under the new tax cut package?

https://t.co/wFGEo2XYUSMerry Christmas from my family to yours! I hope everyone has a happy and blessed Christmas. https://t.co/Jg5SzPgCpXIt’s Saints game day!  All I want for Christmas is a Saints win. #WhoDat https://t.co/CYndUqhF7bAfter 30 years, we will finally have a tax system that nurtures business growth instead of punishing it.  Our middle-class families will start the new year with a long overdue tax cut.

https://t.co/ZTgftbxXHFI spoke with @ChrisCuomo on @CNN about how the tax reform bill helps ordinary people. Here’s how: It doubles the standard deduction, doubles the child tax credit, and lowers the tax rates for everyone. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is for all Americans. https://t.co/LnqcsDFcBkTune in to @CNN @NewDay right now to hear me discuss the latest with the #TaxBill.ICYMI: here's my latest op-ed for @thehill about why it is time to #AuditTheFed. https://t.co/5Vw8bLPrLVSpeaking on the @SenateFloor about #CHIP.Congratulations, Ayrton! https://t.co/HCsy29oVFyHappy to help! https://t.co/u4fu6MQvtGHappy Hanukkah to all who are beginning the celebrations tonight in Louisiana and around the world! https://t.co/RC4Kj9IglD@mmejlaporte I recently sent a letter asking that the Educator Expense Deduction be kept. This would allow teachers to claim a $500 deduction (double what it was previously) for money they spend out of pocket for their classrooms. https://t.co/UinPecWtklICYMI: My resolution asking members of Congress to substitute teach has passed! Teaching is the most difficult job in the world, &amp; very few lawmakers have stood in front of a class of students and taught. You have to experience it to really know what’s going on in the classroom https://t.co/88wKyfiWIrWho knew that debating the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in @BankingGOP would turn into a Meat Loaf lyric battle? Is Nothing Sacred? https://t.co/iwgAGzJYEqBecky and I are praying for @KathleenBlanco. Kathleen is a courageous fighter who selflessly served the people of La. We pray she finds comfort in her faith and family during the difficult days ahead. https://t.co/mTJkXMfx33It’s imperative that we ensure our nation’s refineries have a seat at the table as we continue to debate a potential legislative overhaul of the RFS.  https://t.co/N0fqIcgBBSToday, we honor and remember the sacrifice of those who lost their lives at #PearlHarbor 76 years ago. #PearlHarborRemembranceDay https://t.co/UEozY9AhWiBecky and I had a great date night at the @WhiteHouse Congressional Christmas party last night.  We hope your family has a blessed Christmas. https://t.co/hhZXsVRHFNOn @CNN @NewDay right now speaking with @ChrisCuomo about the latest with #Russia, #Taxes and the #Budget2018I’d like to thank Lieutenant Lennie Day and Vice Admiral Charles W. Ray for presenting me with the @uscoastguard plaque this morning. The @uscoastguard plays a vital role in keeping Louisianans safe. https://t.co/yqa0uEKYYVWe doubled the standard deduction.  We doubled the child tax credit.  We helped taxpayers keep more of their money.  And we repealed the Affordable Care Act mandate that fined people for not getting insurance. 
https://t.co/LZ8pUwFmTWAlways good seeing Louisianans doing great things for our troops! @USNavy 

https://t.co/T8NJkKFoksTune in to @FoxBusiness now to hear me discuss the latest on the #TaxReform bill. @LizClamanWe need to saddle up and ride.  As I told @Varneyco, it’s time to deliver tax cuts to middle-class families, even if it takes all day and all night.
https://t.co/qPfwW4FipcOn @CNN now talking about the #TaxBill. We need to get this economy moving again. We need #TaxReform https://t.co/olVfL1H73OWe borrow $1 million a minute- $1.4 billion a day.  If I thought for a second that this bill would add to the deficit, I wouldn’t vote for it.  We need to get this economy moving again. We need #TaxRefom now. https://t.co/UxXIeehH7RTune in now to @FoxBusiness @AftertheBell to hear me discuss the latest on the Senate #TaxReform bill.Let’s go @Saints! #WhoDat#SmallBizSat is Nov 25! When we #ShopSmall, we support the small businesses that unite our communities. https://t.co/yYU9AYCdMmI would like to give special thanks to the men and women in uniform serving in the United States and overseas. #Thanksgiving2017 https://t.co/Jgn8Rc2au7Thanksgiving is about counting your blessings.  We have a great deal to be thankful for in America, and I hope everyone has a happy and safe Thanksgiving. #thankfulThis week Id like to honor the men &amp; women who have been called to wear our nation’s uniform. Tech. Sgt. Bianca Parker is in the 2nd Bomb Wing at Barksdale @usairforce base. Below is pic of her &amp; her family. Id like to thank Bianca &amp; her family for their sacrifice for our country https://t.co/3t8lYdI3qyI would like to congratulate my colleague @BillCassidy on protecting and increasing #GOMESA funding for Louisiana. https://t.co/tNglefMKaMI think we have to vote on #TaxReform next week. We're trying to strike a balance between cutting taxes, while at the same time remaining mindful of the fact that we owe $20 trillion and we have to pay it back.
https://t.co/3WPqEtojHAOn @MSNBC’s @MeetThePress now talking about the #TaxReformBill. We need to build our economy by empowering our middle-class families. https://t.co/FSY7ZzBIWaCongratulations, @SenThomTillis! https://t.co/3Rk03VYHaMIt’s high time that we offer middle-class Americans a tax code that believes in them. We need a tax reform policy that provides relief to the middle class and returns incentive to work, save, and invest. This bill does just that and is a huge step in the right direction. https://t.co/1HbtCPjURNIt was great to catch up with @lsuprez today. #GeauxTigers https://t.co/gYZqIZzzrjOn @FoxBusiness with @TeamCavuto discussing the Senate #TaxReformPlan. We need to save our middle-class families money and help empower our businesses to create jobs.It’s important to reflect on the freedoms that we enjoy every day as American citizens, and thank those who have devoted their lives to serve and protect the United States. #VeteransDay https://t.co/7HAKiEygyJI introduced a bill this week that would end the diversity visa lottery program. It makes no sense to let someone into our country on the merit of luck. https://t.co/3f3C55SO5cICYMI: I sent a letter to Chairman Hatch urging @GOPSenFinance to keep the Adoption Tax Credit. @DavidAFrench @ERLC @drmoore https://t.co/pmtrxVvxcYThe diversity visa lottery system is nonsense on a stick. You shouldn’t be picked to come to the United States based on the merit of luck. https://t.co/me2BW7vQ3g
