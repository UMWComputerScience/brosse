 https://t.co/l6fKtnGvhIThe admin's authorization of 15k additional H-2B visas will hopefully provide relief to the numerous SD businesses in need. As my recently introduced bill recognizes, states with low unemployment rely on a supplemental workforce to keep businesses running. https://t.co/WQObV548HkIt was a productive week in Congress: 

•#RightToTry 
•The #VAMISSIONAct
•#Relief4MainStreet
•Confirming more of @POTUS's nominees

Big wins for the American people, and there’s more to come.Allowing E15 sales through the summer would give Americans a lower-cost fuel option for the busy travel season and help uphold @POTUS’ commitment to the #RFS. #Ethanol is home-grown energy security, and @EPA shouldn’t delay.I introduced legislation that would prioritize H-2B visa allocation to states with the lowest unemployment rates, which, in turn, would benefit states like South Dakota that need a supplemental workforce, especially during peak tourism season.
