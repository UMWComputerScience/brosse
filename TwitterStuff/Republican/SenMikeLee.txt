Let’s insist on a reassertion of the American people’s control over their government and of their land. #utpol #SIPublicLandsWhen ordinary Americans control their communities and land, it is good for both. When the federal government wields exclusive control, it is good for neither. #utpol #SIPublicLandsWe have the opportunity to honor the promise the federal government made to Utah and Western states when they joined the Union. #utpol #SIPublicLandsSmall reforms here and there are important. But we have to start pushing for what we actually want. We must fight to return these lands. #utpol #SIPublicLandsFinally, our long-term goal must be the transfer of federal lands to the states. And that is the aim of the third bill that I intend to introduce. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThis “new” Homestead Act would allow states, local governments, and individuals to petition the government to use federal land for affordable housing… or education… or health care. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThe second bill I plan to introduce is a new Homestead Act – one to help ordinary Americans in the 21st century. #utpol #SIPublicLandsSpecifically, my bill would prohibit the president from designating or expanding a national monument in the state unless both Congress and the state legislature pass resolutions approving the designation. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThe first, the Protecting Utah’s Rural Communities Act, would protect Utah from future Antiquities Act abuses by giving Utah the same protections currently enjoyed by Wyoming and Alaska. #utpol #SIPublicLandsOur immediate task is to rein in that government and reclaim a space for ordinary Americans to live in freedom. I am working on three specific bills to do just that. #utpol #SIPublicLandsRural Americans want what all Americans want: a dignified, decent-paying job. A family to love and support. A healthy community whose future is determined by local residents—not by their self-styled betters thousands of miles away. #utpol #SIPublicLandsLocals aren’t as lucky. While tourism has contributed much to the West, communities can’t survive on it alone. It is a complement to – not a substitute – for broader economic development. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThey delight in seeing vast swathes of untouched lands, fulfilling their idyllic notions of the West where they can jet in, spend a few days at the cabin, take pictures of animals, and then retreat to their enclaves on the coasts. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThings have only gotten worse since. An even more extreme environmental movement, an alliance of privilege between celebrities, activists, and corporate elites now want to save the Earth at the expense of our rural communities. #utpol #SIPublicLandsNo longer would it be the official policy of the United States government to sell back the land and entrust it to the people. Instead, the policy would be to keep the land for itself.  #utpol #SIPublicLandsAnd in 1976, Congress formalized federal control over federal lands by passing the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. This repealed the Homestead Acts and completely upended federal government’s public land policy. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThe amount of grazing on federal land went into steep decline, causing an exodus from the range that was never reversed. #utpol #SIPublicLandsBetween the mid-1960s and 1980, the amount of wilderness rose from 11.5 million acres to 82.7 million acres—an increase of 716% in less than two decades. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThe activists used land-use restrictions as an “all-purpose tool for stopping economic activity,” in the words of political scientist R. McGreggor Cawley. #utpol #SIPublicLandsBut in the 60s and 70s environmental activists began exploiting public fears about overpopulation and pollution. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThe first westerners were optimistic about federal control of western lands. Teddy Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot advocated for active management of the land, in cooperation with local interests. #utpol #SIPublicLandsFifty, sixty, even seventy percent of the land within Western states’ boundaries was – and remains – controlled by Washington. #utpol #SIPublicLandsWhile they were ultimately successful in petitioning Congress to transfer their public lands from federal to state management, Western states have not been so lucky. #utpol #SIPublicLandsTake Illinois and Missouri, for example. At one point, the federal government controlled more than 90% of their land. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThe promise to sell federal lands in Utah is right there, enshrined in federal law. But, unlike states farther East, the commitment to us was never honored. #utpol #SIPublicLandsWhen Utah came into the Union in 1896, Section 9 of its statehood enabling legislation declared that public land located within the state “shall be sold by the United States subsequent to the admission of said state into the union.” #utpol #SIPublicLandsWhile Easterners and Midwesterners had almost-total control of the land within their boundaries, Western states like Utah entered the Union on inferior terms – as tenants to negligent landlords. #utpol #SIPublicLandsBut by the time Utah and other states entered the Union, Congress had turned its attention elsewhere. Manifest destiny left us behind. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThe Homestead Acts were an engine for middle-class opportunity and growth and set the American standard for the disposition of public resources. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThe cornerstone of this policy was the Homestead Acts which transferred 270 million acres of land out of federal control and into the hands of ordinary Americans. #utpol #SIPublicLandsThroughout the 19th century, Lawmakers sought to facilitate expansion of the nation by acquiring land—and then transferring it to the people, so they could live out their lives as responsible citizens of the republic. #utpol #SIPublicLandsHow did it come to pass that nearly half of the land in the West is owned by the federal government, compared to just 5 percent of the land in the East? #utpol #SIPublicLandsWATCH LIVE: Major speech on public lands policy at @SutherlandInst: “Federal Lands and Royal Forests." https://t.co/FlYSAwyzeS #utpol #SIPublicLandsHogge passed away this week.

The two cancel each other out.Anyone who doesn’t want the Senate to vote on the Due Process Guarantee Act likes Nickleback.  True fact!What’s the best argument you can think of for NOT letting the Senate vote on the Due Process Guarantee Act?@Judgenap Thank you @Judgenap!The DPGA corrects the mistake Congress made in 2012 and protects Americans from indefinite government detention. https://t.co/RXgpkFeKUK.…What kind of country would we have if we freely allowed our government to detain us indefinitely without charge, trial, or counsel?Please tell your senators to support the Due Process Guarantee Act as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.  Let’s vote!@sebastian_byron @conncarroll I’m just trying to fix a problem in the law—one that is easy to ignore today, but could give rise to significant problems.@sebastian_byron Making law is my job.  We are one step way from fixing a bad law and making a better one.By contrast, imagine the immense harm that could come from a law that authorizes the indefinite detention of American citizens!Where is the harm in a law saying that Americans can’t be indefinitely detained without charge or trial on US soil?Our govt isn’t now indefinitely detaining US citizens without charge or trial. But why leave a law in place that purports to authorize that?Why would anyone who voted for a nearly identical version of the DPGA in 2012 now deny his colleagues the right to cast this vote?Why block such a vote, especially when 68 senators wanted to take that vote?Why would a senator object to letting the Senate even VOTE on whether to protect Americans’ due process rights?Why would anyone choose to vote against a bill restoring existing constitutional protections that have been undermined by a bad law?Had we voted on the DPGA, it would have passed, protecting the due process rights of hundreds of millions of American citizens.The DPGA should have received a vote in the Senate.  A total of 68 senators voted against a motion to table the DPGA; they wanted a vote!The DPGA, which I authored along with @SenFeinstein, was pending as an amendment to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.American citizens arrested on American soil should never be subject to indefinite detention without charge, trial, jury, or counsel.@UnsolicitedOpin Sadly, members of both political parties passed and later protected section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, which made DPGA necessary.@robert_dunaway Yes it does.  Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA purports to undermine that and other protections.  We can’t ignore that.The American people cannot be asked to wait another moment before their due process rights are protected by the Due Process Guarantee Act.Each year, @SenFeinstein and I have been told we’d get a vote on the DPGA “at some point,” but it has not happened.  The time has come!Ever since 2012, @SenFeinstein and I have been trying to put the DPGA back into each year’s National Defense Authorization Act.@SenFeinstein and I introduced the DPGA in 2012. It passed with 67 votes, but was somehow removed from the NDAA before final passage.The DPGA was made necessary by Sec. 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, which purported to give the government unrestrained power to detain Americans.The Due Process Guarantee Act would protect U.S. citizens on U.S. soil from being detained indefinitely without charge, counsel, or trial.American citizens arrested on American soil should never be subject to indefinite detention without charge, trial, jury, or counsel.“When you use government to unfairly give your group, corporation, or business an advantage over others that are out there that don’t try to use that access to either fence-out or to increase profits, that’s bad.” https://t.co/pMP6HfKiIpWe just defeated the motion to table our Due Process Guarantee Act amendment. We are now one step closer to ensuring that American citizens may not be detained indefinitely when they are in the United States.In the next hour, the Senate will be voting on the Due Process Guarantee Act. I hope my fellow Senators will acknowledge the mistake Congress made in 2012 and vote not to table the amendment.Congress can take a stand for the Constitution by allowing a vote on the Due Process Guarantee Act, which corrects the mistake Congress made in 2012 and protects Americans from indefinite government detention. https://t.co/mQ7LQf3gMHI’m on the Senate floor speaking on the need to allow votes on amendments like my due Process Guarantee Act.

By tabling this measure today, we have chosen yet again to abdicate our constitutional responsibility.If we choose in this moment to table this resolution we are making a choice to be willfully blind to the exercise of a power that belongs to us. https://t.co/oo3zZbJg9iThis is a fast track process, this is really why the war power resolution matters here. It helps the Senate exercise it’s Article I Section 8 war power. 6/6The war powers resolution provides us with the internal procedural mechanism for putting this up for a vote. This is a privileged motion, meaning we can get it brought to the floor and doesn’t require what we call cloture. 5/6That doesn’t mean it (the War Power Resolution) is unconstitutional. It’s not. This is exactly what the Constitution contemplates. 4/6Now, that’s not surprising because the whole purpose of the War Powers Resolution was to allow Congress to exercise its power to declare war, so presidents are naturally going to resist efforts to restrict and restrain their power. 3/6The WSJ claims that the War Powers Resolution is somehow unconstitutional, citing no authority other than themselves and saying that presidents since then have regarded it as wrong or unconstitutional. 2/6Some quick thoughts on @WSJopinion claims that the War Powers Resolution is unconstitutional: 1/6I will be speaking on SJ Res 54 from the Senate floor in 10 minutes. It's time for Congress to reassert its Article 1 war powers.

https://t.co/16PVdfKClz #utpol https://t.co/HhlSrQ1RNVTonight President Trump gave his annual State of the Union address in front of a joint session of Congress. Here are my thoughts:

https://t.co/Pa5Ct4yucZI completely agree with @USCBO that transparency is essential for credibility. We can work together to ensure transparency efforts serve the needs of policymakers. https://t.co/9b9PZHSLtcMovies like @HBO's "The Sentence" are educating people on the need for #criminaljusticereform bills like the Smarter Sentencing Act. Mandatory minimums are harmful to families and communities, and I look forward to watching the film https://t.co/OX7qxPXzaT #utpolI spoke tonight from the Senate floor on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act https://t.co/eZknlypJscToday, the Senate has the chance to pass legislation that protects children by banning elective abortion after 20 weeks. 20 weeks is 5 months. A baby at that stage can sleep, suck his thumb, &amp; survive outside the womb. That child deserves the right to choose life. #TheyFeelPainRight now, the United States is just one of seven countries in the world that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. On Monday, the Senate has the chance to change that by passing the Pain Capable Unborn Child Act. https://t.co/UhRUjypw92Happy to support such a great cause! https://t.co/zafcnGR3GAI talked to @kevcirilli of @BloombergTV today about the importance of the bipartisan #EarmarkEliminationAct. Watch here: https://t.co/wyvkKj5ZuSCongratulations to newly selected University of Utah President Ruth Watkins. I'm excited to work with Ruth and her team in her new capacity and know @UUtah will be in good hands under her leadership. While I may be a Cougar, I have no problem saying go Utes today!Retweet if you agree that Republicans in the Senate should make Democrats start voting on each of the appropriations bills passed by the House.Remember earmarks? Well, they’re trying to make a comeback. Earmarks can’t bring back the trust Congress has squandered, but here’s how we can, and it includes getting rid of earmarks for good. https://t.co/EKgTwfwrvhI issued the following statement after the Senate voted to invoke cloture on reauthorizing #FISA surveillance provisions tonight: https://t.co/jav29nWvoYI look forward to his deliberate devotion being applied to all as he takes on his new responsibilities as Pres. of the @LDSchurch https://t.co/Yz6qpG69COPres. Nelson is a dedicated servant who has spent decades tirelessly working alongside his brothers &amp; sisters both in &amp; out of the church to bring love &amp; peace into peoples’ lives.Rep.

I look forward to reading the full text of the bill and, hopefully, supporting it..@RepDeSantis and I agree. We need a higher education system that works better for more Americans and their families.
