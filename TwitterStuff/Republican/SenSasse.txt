Today, we honor the 160,000 troops who fought their way onto the beaches and we tell the story of one Nebraskan whose work made it possible. #DDay https://t.co/izniPgV3akAbout those new tariffs: Europe, Canada &amp; Mexico aren't China. You don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. Blanket protectionism is a big part of why we had a Great Depression. "Make America Great Again" shouldn’t mean "Make America 1929 Again."Today, we remember the story of a special Nebraskan monument to our fallen heroes. May this Sea of Red be a tribute to your courage &amp; service forever. Happy #MemorialDay, and Go Big Red. #gbr https://t.co/kUS4jI1DgTKim Jong Un is a murderous despot and habitual liar. The President made the right call to cancel this summit. If North Korea wants diplomacy, it should know that half-measures and spin about its nuclear program won’t cut it.Barbara Bush lived an extraordinary life of devotion, love, and laughter. She was a blessing to the First Family and the nation. Melissa and I lift up the entire Bush family in our prayers during this time.It is good news that today the President directed Larry Kudlow and Ambassador Lighthizer to negotiate U.S. entry into TPP: https://t.co/sfzI3eyDOM https://t.co/B75Bsdsm3xThank you, @NDSS, for bringing the voices of Macy, Clay, and Alijah to Capitol Hill. These kids have a lot to teach us. #BWW2018 https://t.co/ls4RaU0gx5Facebook is a really big and powerful platform. Their decisions on how to police speech will have far-reaching consequences. That’s why I asked Mark Zuckerberg in today's hearing to define “hate speech.”

It is a hard question and an important conversation. https://t.co/YbIXbeReq6Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. persevered, even unto death, in asserting the god-given rights of all Americans.

May we never lose sight of his message. #MLK50 https://t.co/46jQBD8h26He single-handedly saved millions from starvation, but most people haven’t heard of him. Today we honor Norman Borlaug, the ag pioneer who was born #OnThisDay in 1914. https://t.co/Ak098MErhgLots of folks in politics &amp; the media are misconstruing trade. When we talk about trade, we should remember these six big ideas. https://t.co/0Q4HxqKzPtTotal dysfunction. DC is about to add 1.3 TRILLION $ to your debt like it’s no big deal - and meanwhile both of our crazy uncles are fistfighting in the backyard.

Dignity matters. Love matters. To Lucas, Kyle, James, Grant – and to us all. #WDSD18 https://t.co/aG6xiOAeVyFull text of the letter @SenJohnMcCain and I sent seeking a coordinated NATO response to Russia. https://t.co/K0DCtwM2ZP https://t.co/LOL7gkjQGXLet’s get this straight: Equifax put millions of Americans at risk, got a no-bid contract from the feds, and at least one employee turned a personal profit from trading on the misfortune of the victims? 

Someone needs to answer for this. 

https://t.co/Rz3vsJF9QaHere's how steel tariffs will actually kill steel jobs. https://t.co/NzKSGpc2EkOp-ed with @NEFarmBureau: We need to drop the talk of unnecessary and painful trade wars and work to protect NAFTA. Nebraskans have won with NAFTA and scrapping the agreement would be a disastrously bad idea.​  https://t.co/dIdBlOTkjCWe’ve tried tariffs like these a bunch of times over the last two centuries. Every time, American families have suffered. This trade policy will be disastrous. https://t.co/x1KeV9d2y9Trade is great for America. It's great for American families. Trade creates jobs &amp; lowers prices for American families. 

Trade wars do the opposite. No trade war has ever worked. We don't want to make America 1930 again. https://t.co/fK7oy7GcVz#OnThisDay 151 years ago, Nebraska officially became a state. Today we celebrate the pioneers, caretakers of the land, statesmen, and volunteers who have made our state so great. https://t.co/LsjdesXjRa#OnThisDay in 1980, we beat the USSR in a hockey match that is still one of sports history’s greatest upsets: the Miracle on Ice. https://t.co/ULRH4S5DtVSports don’t just build character; they reveal it. Kudos to Rachel Mulligan, whose cross country skiing earned medals in the 500m freestyle race &amp; 1km freestyle race in the @SpecialOlympics Winter World Games in Austria. Thanks for making Nebraska proud! @SONebraska #SOHillDay https://t.co/cyVdmnRyp2Today we remember the "Buffalo Soldiers" who served at Nebraska’s Ft Robinson nearly 100 years before the Civil Rights Act. These volunteers suffered indignities from their colleagues, commanding officers, and even from the very citizens they worked to protect. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/bS3s76rUw6Honored to have @NEStatePatrol’s John Lewis as my #SOTU guest tonight. This hero went above &amp; beyond to serve his neighbor after hurricanes ravaged the Florida Keys. America needs more neighbors like him. https://t.co/nYV9qHWHK7Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands will travel to Washington, D.C. from across the country to #MarchForLife. The crowd will fill city blocks. But the real movement is even bigger. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/wCkAMIWoHfThe #NEBreakfast is back. Check out the 2018 dates and learn more about this 75-year-old tradition here: https://t.co/iZi9NNF1Uy https://t.co/2phIRUD12w#OnThisDay in 1888, a blizzard tore through the Great Plains, killing about 300 people, many of them children. But the real story wasn’t the great power of the storm, it was the great stories of resilience and heroism - especially of the schoolteachers. https://t.co/4UXYjy2VQOThis is national security 101: Washington should be hunting down terrorists who fund global violence with domestic drug money. https://t.co/XGUMbrWGIKIt’s not helpful to call the press the enemy of the American people. Here’s why. #1a https://t.co/dhiVY5ndqZWhat this terrifying statistic tells us: we are failing to teach the First Amendment to the next generation. https://t.co/TBHz8WIf6QMerry Christmas! Today we remember a Christmas miracle that happened #OnThisDay in North Platte in 1941. https://t.co/AevghkcYmsThe First Amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment, and you don’t get to separate the five freedoms that are in there. https://t.co/Y6OTkHOk2v#OnThisDay in 1891, a group of boys at a YMCA played the first-ever game of basketball. But the story is bigger than the sport - it's about inventor James Naismith &amp; his heart for service. What he teaches us: https://t.co/axOqfvJ6if#OnThisDay in 1777, Washington led his army into a winter encampment at Valley Forge. Why we should remember their bleak Christmas today: https://t.co/VdCRiaFgU4CONFIRMED. The end of a long process in the Senate is just the beginning of a new chapter in Steve Grasz’s distinguished record of public service for Nebraska &amp; the nation. https://t.co/lyLino6A4G 

https://t.co/8grn7v4A7ahttps://t.co/U78lv7qK9fhttps://t.co/I45M15Yq4y#OnThisDay in 1775, we had a plan to turn stolen British guns back on the redcoats &amp; break the Siege of Boston. The only problem? They were 300 miles away, at Fort Ticonderoga. Watch the incredible story: https://t.co/a1kwLVKeE6Today we give thanks that our country was based on the premise of religious liberty. Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/x3aEaFDWvR#OnThisDay in 1863, President Lincoln spoke timeless truths on a Civil War battlefield to unite a tired &amp; divided nation around our founding beliefs.

Colin’s story: https://t.co/o2JhIzEKsR https://t.co/izxHB1iib5We owe our veterans an enduring debt of gratitude, today and every day. #VeteransDay https://t.co/UXfHtKc2dsTheir stories help us understand the cost of freedom.

Thank you for your service. https://t.co/Yx7dGfWLEDThe ABA purports to be a neutral arbiter, but is frankly twisting its ratings process to drive a political agenda. Here's how: https://t.co/kyQgSNHOOT#OnThisDay 53 years ago, Reagan gave his famous “A Time for Choosing” speech. It still has much to say to us today. https://t.co/4DaIpLUfUONow that we’ve got your attention with Dr Pepper, let’s not forget the real substance from today’s hearing. https://t.co/rvSmohvnnhNebraskans have no patience for improper treatment of our veterans, nor for attempts to cover it up. https://t.co/Zkt8ZjtqqCWe celebrate the fall of ISIS in Raqqa &amp; the liberation of the oppressed, but this is no time to let off of the gas. https://t.co/REBjJcXVWf https://t.co/5Xl7lAA5bFRussia is a clear adversary in cyberspace and we can’t afford these self-inflicted injuries. https://t.co/tKA0uQyeig https://t.co/82VCTw9vmuSo, post-hack, Equifax gets $$$ in a no-bid IRS contract &amp; potentially profits selling ID protection to hack victims?

Here's why Judge Gorsuch will faithfully embody the spirit of that robe: https://t.co/HqzCumUuSUJudge Gorsuch knows what a judge's job is.
