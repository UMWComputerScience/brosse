Ted Cruz: Mike Lee 'the single best choice' to replace Anthony Kennedy on Supreme Court https://t.co/tMDHuvhSLOCruz: Mike Lee best choice to fill Supreme Court vacancy https://t.co/oEHM1oYzLTThank you @CBPSouthTexas Laredo Sector Chief @JOwensUSBP &amp; @CBPDeputyComm Vitiello for receiving Chief’s Honor First Award at the 94th @CBP birthday celebration in Laredo. I'll continue to support the efforts of the men &amp; women in green who protect our homeland. #HonorFirst #USBP https://t.co/ilzCjyfEmeHere is my statement following the passage of the 2019 #FarmBill --&gt; https://t.co/WvELfvDyUL https://t.co/PFGVkqYx4SIn case you missed my full interview on @FoxNews where I discussed Justice Kennedy's #SCOTUS retirement, among other topics, watch it here --&gt; https://t.co/DKv8Gz1gkLICYMI on the @SenateFloor: @SenMikeLee, @SenJohnKennedy &amp; my amendment strengthens the work requirements for food stamps for able-bodied adults. Right now, more than a third of the country lives in areas with no work requirements. https://t.co/MVdrG8MIRDThe Visa Transparency &amp; Anti-Trafficking Act of 2018 is bipartisan legislation aimed at bolstering US anti-trafficking efforts by asking the Department of Homeland Security to submit an annual report on nonimmigrant visa applications, applicants, grantees, recruiters &amp; employers.Americans from both parties understand that our country has a moral obligation to combat human trafficking. Law enforcement needs better tools if we are to identify potential victims and rescue them from harm. One of those tools is information. --&gt; https://t.co/JXLD03RfozOur amendment would also help states create and improve work activation programs for their disadvantaged citizens with resources like vocational education, job training, community service programs, and job search assistance. --&gt; https://t.co/h0bt2e33qG.@SenMikeLee &amp; I introduced an amendment to the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 which would remove state SNAP waivers, strengthen work requirements &amp; eliminate the treatment of able-bodied adults w/o dependents (ABAWDs) as a separate population from other work-capable adults. https://t.co/yDtP7jRHOvThere are another two names that I think @POTUS would be well-advised to consider: 
-U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco 
-Fifth Circuit Appellate Judge Jim Ho
And, of course my friend @SenMikeLee.

I look forward to the continued success of Camp Hope and congratulate them on the groundbreaking of the new townhomes to serve veterans living with #PTSD.I am glad to see Camp Hope moving forward with their mission with the groundbreaking of four new townhouses, which will be used to provide shelter for veterans and their families seeking treatment at their facilities.June is #PTSDAwarenessMonth, a time for us to shine a light on a challenge that afflicts veterans. With veteran suicide rates continuing at alarming levels &amp; a tragic stigma surrounding mental health issues, I'm grateful for organizations like Camp Hope, who help vets year-round.During my visit, I met with veterans who dedicated their lives to protect and serve our great nation, only to return home with mental scars making the transition to civilian life more difficult.Proud of the work @ptsdusa's Camp Hope is doing to provide for our veterans living w Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Last year, I had the honor to visit Camp Hope &amp; saw first-hand the positive impact of its mission to care for vets struggling w the return to civilian life.Great to meet with my summer #DC interns and thank them for the important work they do every day providing assistance to our #Texas constituents! https://t.co/jfOCMJxxZ5Proud to join @JohnCornyn in a letter to @POTUS in support of @GovAbbott’s request for a federal disaster declaration after extreme flooding ravaged South Texas last week. --&gt; https://t.co/PcSqNP6qGF https://t.co/8y9jObvFrYEnjoyed talking with the Archer Center’s Graduate Fellows last night about upholding the values of the Constitution, thanks y'all for having me as a guest speaker! https://t.co/1Px4DBuxGbHad a great time meeting with folks from Austin, Abilene, and Seguin at this morning's #Texas Tuesday Coffee.

https://t.co/LyKFS71nD1HUD’s approval of over $5 billion in disaster recovery funding is welcome news to the millions of Texans who were affected by the destruction of Hurricane Harvey.

Wayfair. @SteveDaines, @SenMikeLee, and I submitted a joint amicus brief in this case to argue against new internet sales taxes.--&gt;Allowing all students, including public, private &amp; religious school students, to use 529 savings accts to cover eligible educational expenses, such as tutoring, standardized testing fees &amp; educational therapies for students with disabilities, among other educational expenses.#EmpowerOurStudents wins for TX families include:
--&gt;Reincorporating homeschool students as equally eligible to use 529 savings accts for educational expenses.
--&gt;Ensuring all families are able to use tax-advantaged accts to pay for their child’s elementary &amp; secondary education. https://t.co/1sVZVbpcYcBy investing in the next generation of students and expanding school choice, we’re able to allow more students to have access to an education that truly fits their child’s needs, and to escape the one-size-fits-all approach to education. #EmpowerOurStudents https://t.co/YMYbge0HK1#EmpowerOurStudents rights that wrong by re-including homeschool families as equally eligible to use a 529 savings account for educational expenses to ensure that all families are able to use these tax-advantaged accounts to pay for their child’s elementary &amp; secondary education.Homeschool families were cynically excluded by Senate Democrats from the Student Opportunity Amendment, leaving homeschoolers ineligible to utilize the expanded usage of 529 savings accounts. #EmpowerOurStudents --&gt; https://t.co/IT9XhVDLDu https://t.co/ZWgpHnoHFgAs inclement weather conditions continue to impact the RGV &amp; coastal areas of Texas, to all my fellow Texans, please heed local weather warnings to ensure utmost safety. --&gt; https://t.co/5Q572rBjBDJoined @RandPaul, @SenatorLankford, &amp; @JimInhofe in a letter to the @NSF Inspector General requesting an investigation into taxpayer funded grants that seek to influence political and social debate rather than conduct scientific research. --&gt; https://t.co/FHjw71dgTY https://t.co/DTDDCvZHWwI am disappointed the Senate failed today to pass the President’s $15 billion spending cut package. This is a small, but critical, first step to rein in wasteful government spending and provide relief from our nation's crippling debt.It claims to be objective, but spends time &amp; resources attacking Israel while ignoring the crimes of terrorist groups. Participation in the UNHRC did nothing to advance US national security interests. I've long called for ending participation &amp; commend the Admin for its decision.The United States has been legitimizing the thugs &amp; autocrats on the United Nations Human Rights Council for too long. This is a body that claims to sit in judgment about human rights, but includes human rights abusers such as Venezuela, China &amp; Cuba. --&gt; https://t.co/QujQwdswgmCongratulations to the 7th Bomb Wing of the @usairforce for being awarded the Outstanding Unit Award for the sixth time by @AFGlobalStrike! I am proud of the tremendous service and accomplishments of our men and women at Dyess Air Force Base. --&gt; https://t.co/K4iM2sBcoSIt's time for Democrats to put their politics to the side and join us in our efforts to bring about real change.Grateful for my Republican colleagues' support for the Protect Kids &amp; Parents Act. Together we are working on legislation that focuses on solving the problem of kids being separated from their parents at the border. https://t.co/fpbTl6ZGkITune in momentarily to my Facebook page to watch my LIVE remarks with #Texas @NFIB members, where I will be discussing my priorities for 2018. Watch here —&gt; https://t.co/XLV0LDBT14Read the text of the bill here --&gt; https://t.co/Y8tGOwZzIQIt also doubles the number of immigration judges and expedites the process by which we handle asylum claims by families who enter our country. I hope that my Democratic colleagues can join with us to stop the crisis that is occurring at the border. --&gt; https://t.co/1cjnlguxj6We can come together to fix this problem. The Protect Kids and Parents Act focuses on solving the current problem: it stops family separation, except in situations where it is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the child.Over the past few weeks, Americans have been rightly horrified by the images and videos coming from our southern border, where tearful children are being pulled away from their mothers and fathers. There is no doubt that this must stop, immediately. https://t.co/Oa0VCgE2y2ICYMI at @senjudiciary: "It is not possible, logically, for Director Comey to tell us the truth, and for Director McCabe to be telling the truth.

Watch my full Q&amp;A here --&gt; https://t.co/DWl6HjhkV6 https://t.co/Si5jmMG9DKWith this passage, we take another step towards supporting our military, enhancing its readiness &amp; providing the capabilities our military needs. In today’s challenging threat environment, a strong military is vital to preserving our national security, prosperity &amp; way of life.Additionally, the Senate bill authorizes another well-deserved pay raise for America’s men and women in uniform. I am proud of the work we accomplished for our nation in this year's NDAA. #FY19NDAAThe #FY19NDAA provides a clear framework for rebuilding and strengthening our military. In support of the National Defense Strategy, this legislation prioritizes the development of strategic capabilities while maintaining the strength of the force. --&gt; https://t.co/ONolzdcha2On this day in 1865, General Gordon Granger rode into #Galveston, Texas &amp; delivered a proclamation that continues to ring loud &amp; clear throughout the course of our nation's history to the present: the abolishment of slavery and emancipation for all. #Juneteenth #FreedomDay https://t.co/PPFhpf1QWkMy legislation will fix the backlog in immigration cases, remove legal barriers to swift processing, and resolve asylum cases on an expedited basis. And I urge my Democratic colleagues to join me to work to solve this problem. https://t.co/VzYRww54NL“A great advantage of this #rescissions package is that Democrats are unable to filibuster it, and if Republicans stand together, we can start cutting back on unnecessary spending &amp; provide much needed fiscal sanity to our country.” #fiscalsanity https://t.co/LEHRqyKYYgLIVE now! https://t.co/0XZULhn0voThis morning ~10:30am CT, I will be joining @SenMikeLee in a press conference urging the Senate to vote on the Spending Cuts to Expired &amp; Unnecessary Programs Act to take action against our nation's crippling debt. Watch my live remarks here —&gt; https://t.co/XLV0LDBT14Sen. Ted Cruz introduces 'emergency' bill to keep immigrant families together, slams Dems' proposal https://t.co/zcjPQeMm2z #FoxNewsWe can fix this. If my Democratic colleagues will join me, not play politics but work to solve the problem, we can start to end family separation this week. And, we can honor the rule of law.While cases are pending, families should stay together.Children belong w their families.Once their cases have been adjudicated–under my bill, in no longer than 14 days–those who meet the standard should be granted asylum &amp; those who don’t should be returned to their home country.The answer isn't what congressional Dems are proposing: releasing illegal aliens &amp; returning to the failed policy of ‘catch &amp; release.’ Rather, we must fix the backlog in immigration cases, remove legal barriers to swift processing &amp; resolve asylum cases on an expedited basis.I've visited detention facilities tragically housing children. For too long, they've been victims of our broken immigration system, detained under the Obama Administration &amp; through the present, facing horrific physical or sexual assault from human traffickers.All Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers. This must stop. Now. We can end this crisis by passing the legislation I am introducing this week. --&gt; https://t.co/D4W7e7qaw6.@AstroPeggy is a national treasure. 1st woman to serve as chief of the astronaut corps, first female commander of @Space_Station &amp; she has spent more time in space than any American. Thank you for your remarkable service to our country &amp; congrats on a well-deserved retirement. https://t.co/GQO5psI4SuWe are continuing to rebuild, and I know that we’ll come out of this stronger than before because the Texas spirit of determination, generosity, and strength will guide us forward. --&gt; https://t.co/3Z2QLPvXA7I am inspired by the incredible resiliency that our teachers and students displayed in the wake of Harvey’s destruction. Committed to our children’s education, Texas communities stood together and our students finished the school year strong.Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc along Texas' Gulf Coast, leaving many students, families &amp; teachers without a home, a place to work, or even a place to go to school. But Texans are not easily knocked down. As we all prepare for summer break &amp; I look back on the past school year.Tune in to my Facebook page momentarily for my LIVE remarks with the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee.

McCain National Defense Authorization Act (#NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019, in efforts to strengthen Texas’ military and space competitiveness and address national security threats abroad. #FY19NDAAHappy #FlagDay, America.

It is well past time to close it.The Palestinians have encouraged the International Criminal Court (ICC) to launch a baseless and illegitimate investigation against Israel, which is unacceptable and underlines why Congress long ago prohibited the PLO office in Washington DC.They have also turned that hostility against the United States, condemning President Trump, Vice President Pence, Ambassador Haley, and other American officials who stood with Israel and against terrorism.The Palestinian leadership has shown relentless &amp; unrepentant hostility toward our close ally Israel. They have refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish State &amp; directly incentivized terrorism by providing hundreds of millions in salaries &amp; benefits to terrorists &amp; their families.Proud to pen letter w @RosLehtinen to Secretary of State Pompeo and Attorney General Sessions urging the Administration to take the necessary steps and instituting the necessary legal action to close the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) office.--&gt; https://t.co/QigsPHw0lCWe cannot turn a blind eye to continuing unnecessary spending and driving our nation further into debt.

Sadly, we also discovered a pattern of secret taxpayer-funded settlements for members of Congress accused of harassment or assault. That is unacceptable.We need to do this, and far more — Congress should take advantage of every opportunity to reduce our national debt, including saving money that doesn’t need to be spent.A great advantage of a rescissions package is that Democrats are unable to filibuster it, which means that if Republicans stand together we can start cutting back on unnecessary spending.Proud to co-sponsor legislation that serves as a great first step to rein in wasteful government spending, and I applaud @POTUS for putting this process in motion. --&gt; https://t.co/iwzdrzKaSHThis legislation also makes investments &amp; establishes policies that deter aggression and defeat global threats.

It’s a step that I have been urging him to do for the last year and a half.In case you missed my remarks at @Heritage yesterday where I discussed the massive anti-government protests occurring in #Nicaragua, watch them here --&gt; https://t.co/DDHGWzferc.@FoxNews: "We need to be using all the procedural tools we have to pass things w 51 votes to get victory after victory after victory for the American people &amp; reining in wasteful spending is certainly something we ought to be doing. So, I applaud the White House for doing that." https://t.co/XvyQmYjoBdTune in to my Facebook page momentarily to watch my live remarks with the Denton County Chambers of Commerce &amp; @michaelcburgess, where I will be discussing on my priorities for Texas in 2018. Watch here --&gt; https://t.co/XLV0LDBT14.@FoxNews: "Yesterday, the President made a decision that saved thousands of jobs and solved the broken RINs system...
RINs skyrocketed and were threatening the jobs of thousands upon thousands of blue-collar union members at refineries." https://t.co/SIdH5xHEJbHope y’all tune in to @foxandfriends at 6:30am CT to watch my live interview!North Korea is one of the most dangerous places on this earth, to US national security &amp; to freedom in general. I will continue working w the Administration &amp; Congress to ensure nothing less than the complete, verifiable &amp; irreversible denuclearization of Kim Jong-un’s regime.But in this moment we must also remember families like Fred and Cindy Warmbier, whose son Otto returned from North Korea on death’s doorstep, and died less than a week after coming home. Today’s development is encouraging but the United States and our allies must remain vigilant.These Americans persevered through torture and malnourishment amid totalitarian darkness, and I join their families and all our fellow citizens in celebrating their freedom.Today is a good day for America. I commend @POTUS and @SecPompeo for negotiating the return of Kim Dong Chul, Tony Kim, and Kim Hak Song from North Korea. —&gt; https://t.co/K6YZrjulMi.@POTUS’ rescissions package is a good common sense first step to rein in wasteful and unnecessary spending. Congress needs to take advantage of all opportunities to reduce our national debt, including saving money that won’t be spent.”Los Estados Unidos está con ustedes en su lucha por la libertad y el estado de derecho. Ustedes han puesto a Ortega en sus talones, y espero que el día llegue pronto el día cuando los nicaragüenses tendrán otra vez un gobierno que realmente los represente.”“Para al pueblo de Nicaragua: habrá una fecha de vencimiento para el reino de Ortega. https://t.co/YW8Yq9btZKTo the people of #Nicaragua: there’ll be an expiration date for the Ortega reign. The US stands with you in your fight for freedom. You have put Ortega on his heels &amp; I’m hopeful the day will come when Nicaraguans will again have a government which truly represents them. https://t.co/XqhQWDtqhH“Con Ortega en el poder, Nicaragua continuará seguirá a adoptando políticas hostiles contra los EE.UU. y sus intereses.”“Ortega ofreció un ‘diálogo’ con aquellos que se oponen a su régimen, y luego envió la policía nacional a recoger a los disidentes y los periodistas y asesinar a manifestantes pacíficos.”“Daniel Ortega, el presidente Marxista de Nicaragua, una y otra vez ha demostrado su brutal desprecio básico por las libertades humanas constantemente.””Cinco estaciones de tv fueron eliminadas, y un video en vivo de Facebook q demuestra mostrar un periodista asesinado mientras cubría la violencia ha sido distribuido. La policía confiscó el agua, la comida y medicamentos de voluntarios que estaban ayudando a los manifestantes.”“Los Sandinistas desplegaron la policía nacional, y la violencia escaló. Docenas fueron asesinados. Cienes fueron heridos, detenidos, o desaparecidos. La prensa que trató de cubrir estos crímenes ha sido censurada, y periodistas han sido acosados por agentes del gobierno.”Any such money should be directly tied to basic democratic reforms, otherwise, these loans are just disinterested charity for a dictator. #NICANICA mandates specific preconditions to be met before the U.S. approves loans flowing from international financial institutions to the Nicaraguan Government. These financial institutions – which U.S. taxpayer contributes to – are keeping the regime &amp; its practices afloat. #NICAFortunately, the United States has options to put pressure on Ortega and diminish his influence. Along with several of my fellow Senators, I introduced the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act. #NICADaniel Ortega, the Marxist President of Nicaragua, has proven his brutal disregard for basic human liberties. Ortega offered a “dialogue” w those who opposed his regime, and then sent his national police to round up dissidents &amp; journalists &amp; murder peaceful protesters. https://t.co/Hb5jCG3YLU“Five TV stations were taken off the air, and a Facebook live video has been circulated showing the murder of a journalist who was covering the violence. The police confiscated water, food, and medical supplies from volunteers helping protestors.”“The Sandinistas deployed their national police force, and the violence escalated. Dozens were murdered. Hundreds were injured, detained, or missing. The press that tried to cover these crimes has been censored, and reporters have been harassed by agents of the government.”Sen. Cruz con @Heritage: “A final del mes pasado, medio millón de nicaragüenses protestaron en las calles contra el régimen corrupto de Ortega. Las protestas fueron provocadas debido a cambios propuestos a la seguridad social nacional.”“At the end of the last month, half a million Nicaraguans took to the streets to protest the corrupt Ortega regime. The protests were sparked due to proposed changes to their national social security program.” https://t.co/GtbA5KCD4W
