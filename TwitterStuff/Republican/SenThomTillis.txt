His counsel was sought by many Presidents ‚Äì Republicans and Democrats alike ‚Äì in no small part because of his unshakable moral clarity and convictions. (2/3)Reverend Billy Graham, a proud North Carolinian, was truly America‚Äôs Pastor and spiritual compass. He dedicated his life to preaching the Gospel and inspired millions of people in America and across the globe. (1/3)A great meeting today @VolvoGroupNA in Greensboro.

I want to replicate these results on the federal level.Although the bill is not perfect, I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize our criminal justice system to reduce recidivism and promote public safety. #CJReformI voted for the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, bipartisan legislation that increases access to recidivism reduction programs &amp; helps prisoners successfully re-enter society &amp; narrows some mandatory minimum sentences to focus on violent offenders &amp; serious drug offenders.It‚Äôs clear the only path forward to providing a permanent solution for #DACA, securing our borders &amp; modernizing our immigration system is building consensus on a plan @POTUS supports &amp; can be signed into law. I‚Äôll continue to work on both sides of the aisle to reach consensus.We must protect DACA youth and secure our borders, and the Secure &amp; Succeed Act is the only bill that can become law.Schumer-Rounds-Collins is well-intentioned but falls drastically short of being a proposal that can get a vote in the House and be signed into law. The Senate needs to learn from the Gang of 8 failure, not repeat it.Reminder for Thursday, February 15!
