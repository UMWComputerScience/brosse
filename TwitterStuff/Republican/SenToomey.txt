Moreover, whoever is nominated should understand the proper role of a judge is to apply the law, including the U.S. Constitution, as written. I look forward to meeting with the President’s choice in the coming weeks.In the coming weeks, President Trump will announce a nominee to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court. This person should be committed to the rule of law and ensuring everyone is treated fairly under it.Justice Anthony Kennedy has admirably served our nation for the past 30 years as a Supreme Court Justice. He will be remembered as a thoughtful and fair jurist. I thank Justice Kennedy for his service and wish him nothing but the best in the future.As any pet owner knows, our cats &amp; dogs can be more than just animals--they are our companions, helpers, &amp; family.

Read about my amendment w/@SenGillibrand: https://t.co/XHgMGkuhwtICYMI: I joined @BloombergTV this afternoon to explain why it’s a bad idea for the administration to claim 'national security' as a reason to impose tariffs on steel from our closest allies.

I agree. This should be our trade policy.Invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, hostile actions in Syria, and meddling in our elections - Russia should be disqualified from the G7 until misbehaviors end.I spoke with the @WSJ's Paul Gigot for @JERonFNC. Be sure to watch our conversation on trade and why levying taxes on American consumers in the name of 'national security' is a very bad idea.

I hope other colleagues join this bipartisan common-sense effort as well. https://t.co/xOluWPbRzBBy passing legislation to require congressional approval of national security-designated tariffs, Congress can reassert its constitutional responsibility (Art 1, Sec 8, Clauses 1 &amp; 3) on trade &amp; ensure Americans can keep buying affordable products &amp; keep selling our goods abroad.The decision to use these taxes should not be taken lightly or unilaterally.Tariffs are taxes on American consumers. They hurt American workers, families, and employers. Imposing them under the false pretense of ‘national security’ weakens our economy, our credibility with other nations, and invites retaliation.Our commitment to veterans means always improving health care provided by the VA. The bipartisan #VAMISSIONAct seeks to give veterans more control over health care decisions &amp; access to the best treatment possible. I’m glad @POTUS signed this important legislation into law.74 years ago today, 73,000 U.S. troops embarked on a daring mission to turn the tide of a world at war. Thanks to their bravery and sacrifice, #DDay was successful and marked a major turning point in the liberation of Europe. https://t.co/qQykRUkavpToday’s @TimesTribune editorial spotlights my efforts to push back on new taxes that will harm American consumers and businesses, and limit economic growth. Read “Tariff power to Congress”: https://t.co/0jVXvEBE2KWhat they said. https://t.co/4dXJCpiWLSOn National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we remember the victims of senseless gun violence. Congress should pass common sense gun safety reforms while protecting the rights of law abiding Americans. I remain committed to working w/my colleagues on both sides on this crucial issue. https://t.co/HqaUTWeNvHIf this devolves into a full-blown trade war, the resulting harm will undo all of the great economic progress we’ve made with deregulation and tax reform.Congress should assert its constitutional responsibility and lead on trade policy so Americans keep access to affordable goods and services, and the opportunity to sell our products abroad.I'll be cosponsoring @SenMikeLee's bill, S.177, to rein in the executive branch's power to impose unilateral tax increases like these.Claiming steel bought from our allies is a 'national security' threat weakens our credibility. These tariffs, i.e. taxes, hurt American workers, employers, and consumers.Bad news that @POTUS has decided to impose taxes on American consumers buying steel and aluminum from our closest allies--Canada, the EU, and Mexico (with whom we run a trade surplus on steel). In addition to higher prices, these tariffs invite retaliation.I've seen members of my family suffer from incurable diseases &amp; I sympathize w/ wanting a chance to save one’s life by trying new therapies. It’s why I cosponsored the #RightToTry Act. On behalf of those hoping for a cure, glad to see @POTUS signed @SenRonJohnson’s bill into law.Powerful testimony at my @GOPSenFinance field hrg in Bensalem today on opioid misuse in Medicare &amp; Medicaid.

This inhumane behavior must stop. https://t.co/smXX2GcClVI joined @realDonaldTrump at the @WhiteHouse for the signing of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, &amp; Consumer Protection Act. This bipartisan law ‘right sizes' regs for community banks that provide access to credit to millions of small businesses &amp; hardworking families. https://t.co/BQ7tqs82GFRaising taxes on Americans who choose to buy imported cars or trucks is a bad idea. Doing it under the false pretense of national security--Section 232--is an even worse idea, as it invites retaliation and weakens our credibility on actual trade disputes..@RepScottPerry &amp; I enjoyed speaking with a group of bright 4th grade students from Highland Elementary in Cumberland County. Thanks for coming to D.C. to learn how your government works and for your great questions! https://t.co/xGtcXe0wJOThere is more work to be done reforming the VA, but I am encouraged that the bipartisan VA Mission Act passed the Senate today and will soon be signed into law.The commitment to America's veterans, including PA's one million men and women who served, means continuously striving to improve VA health care. The VA Mission Act seeks to give veterans more control over health care decisions and access to the best possible treatment.Today, I joined with @SenMarkey, @SenatorCardin, @SenToddYoung, @SenJeffMerkley and @marcorubio in urging @POTUS to continue holding accountable the Russian and Chechen officials responsible for the persecution of LGBT persons in Chechnya. https://t.co/MRpRG9ld7y.@SenJeffMerkley and I have both had our identities stolen to file false comments on the @FCC's website.

While we are just learning the details of what happened, I am thankful for the first responders on the scene.ICYMI: I went to the floor yesterday to honor the brave men and women of law enforcement for #PoliceWeek. To the more than 25,000 law enforcement officers in Pennsylvania, thank you for your service and your sacrifice. https://t.co/D7MbzAA4jbGreat news! The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission @PA_PUC announced today that thanks to #TaxReform, many Pennsylvania residents will see lower utility rates.

Osvaldo Albarati paid the ultimate price for this misguided rule. I worked on a bipartisan fix so our federal correctional officers can protect themselves.

Current policy makes it impossible for federal correctional officers to protect themselves getting to &amp; from work.In 1986, Congress established a scholarship in memory of Sen. Barry Goldwater.

We give thanks to those who volunteer to keep us safe and remember they put their lives on the line every day.The responsible way to fund the government is incrementally, after scrutiny and the opportunity to amend in a transparent process on the Senate floor.Although I am pleased that Congress is providing additional resources to rebuild our military, bills like this inevitably spend too much money and much of it unwisely.This is a failure of one of our most fundamental responsibilities and it contributes to our huge deficit and dangerously mounting debt.It’s irresponsible that Congress would pass, with little debate, less transparency, and no opportunity for amendments, a two-thousand-page, trillion-dollar spending bill chock-full of wasteful and ineffective programs.While I get why he'd want some delicious Philly soft pretzels, I’m afraid @Sen_JoeManchin is sorely mistaken if he thinks his @WVUhoops Mountaineers stand a chance against Jay Wright and the #1 seed @NovaMBB Wildcats in the #Sweet16.

We must continue this fight to keep our communities safe.A bipartisan majority of the Senate has repeatedly supported my legislation, the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, to end these misguided policies, but a partisan minority continues to put politics ahead of the safety of our communities.I was pleased to join @POTUS and law enforcement leaders at the White House today to discuss how to end dangerous sanctuary city policies.As the grandson of Irish immigrants who traveled to this country from County Cork in the 1920’s, I wish all Pennsylvanians a Happy #StPatricksDay and Erin go Bragh!This week, the @girlscouts are celebrating their 106th birthday. A great organization that provides fun and valuable experiences for girls across America. They also make one of my favorite treats, Caramel deLites!Congratulations to Pennsylvania's own Reese Caldwell &amp; Natalia Orlovsky, who were both finalists in #RegeneronSTS 2018, the nation’s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors! It was a pleasure meeting with you both. https://t.co/q50Fb2RBS0 https://t.co/OQw9Udj3m4During the many years of our friendship, I’ve had the pleasure of getting Larry’s advice and counsel, and know first-hand how the President and his team will benefit with Larry on board. As one of his staunchest admirers, I look forward to working with him in this new role.Over his career, Larry has been a strong proponent for pro-growth tax policies, free trade, and an effective messenger on the dangers of overregulation and excessive government spending.President Trump has made a great choice in appointing Larry Kudlow to lead the National Economic Council.I’m working on sensible measures to address gun violence while respecting the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens. I spoke about this on the Senate floor today. #Enough #NeverAgain Watch: https://t.co/SN4ltB9W1hThis common-sense legislation provides state law enforcement with critical information they can use to decide whether to investigate and prosecute these individuals under state laws. For more info: https://t.co/gLs0jK0cnyAG Sessions’ decision is a welcome 1st step, but Congress should take the next step by enacting the Toomey-Coons NICS Denial Notification Act, which requires federal authorities to alert states within 24 hours when prohibited individuals "lie and try" to purchase firearms.We are pleased that AG Sessions is directing all U.S. Attorneys to more vigorously enforce existing gun laws against individuals who are legally barred from owning a gun but “lie and try” to buy one. Unfortunately, federal prosecutors rarely pursue these cases..@ChrisCoons and my statement on @TheJusticeDept cracking down on illegal firearms:Thank you to everyone who joined me today for my telephone town hall.

I am pleased that a state-of-the-art Coast Guard cutter, named after him, is being commissioned today. https://t.co/RMypW8IyyFThey included National Review, the Club for Growth, and the Bradley Foundation-all at once. Kris and I miss Dusty and we'll keep  his loving family and his eternal soul in our prayers.After his family, Dusty's greatest love was the liberty of this great republic and the opportunity it offered. He devoted untold hours, enormous talent, and considerable treasure to leading and supporting institutions that fight for our liberty.We lost a great American today with the passing of Dusty Rhodes. From humble origins to high finance, Dusty epitomized the American dream. I knew him best as a friend, mentor, and always-happy warrior in the ongoing battle for American freedom.I will continue to work with the administration to mitigate the effects of these tariffs on Pennsylvania industries and workers.The administration invoking national security to impose #tariffs on imported steel and aluminum is a big mistake that will increase costs on American consumers, weaken our economy, and invite retaliation from other countries on other products.While it is good that Americans won't have to pay new taxes on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, reportedly this new proclamation will, instead, force big tax increases onto American consumers of steel and aluminum from our other trading partners.Pennsylvanians, like millions of other Americans, are experiencing how beneficial #TaxReform is for them and their families through increased wages, bonuses, and job creation. Check out how Pennsylvania companies are rewarding their employees thanks to #TaxReform. https://t.co/5tB7fTaq0ZGary Cohn has been a smart and effective force for regulatory reform, tax reform and expanding trade.

I wish nothing but the best for you and your family in retirement. https://t.co/m5JiPyey31This bipartisan bill is a critical step forward in helping to ensure that our communities can be safe from criminals. Learn more about the NICS Denial Notification Act: https://t.co/o36SYXT1ebWe can make progress on gun safety while respecting the Second Amendment rights of American citizens, including better enforcing existing gun laws &amp; responding to warning signs of criminal behavior.Our NICS Denial Notification Act requires @FBI to notify states within 24 hours when a person who is prohibited from getting a gun lies about their background in an attempt to buy one. That’s a federal felony &amp; it goes almost entirely unprosecuted now..@ChrisCoons, @MarcoRubio, @SenBillNelson, &amp; I are introducing a bill that gives state law enforcement critical info so they can better enforce existing gun laws against those who lie &amp; try to purchase a gun but legally shouldn't own them.Statement from @SenTedCruz and me following today's biofuels meeting at the White House: https://t.co/VeIyapLg8aStatement from @Sen_JoeManchin and me following today's meeting at the White House: https://t.co/qIXSUyKjmjAs America's Pastor, the late Rev. Billy Graham delivered a message of hope and salvation to millions. Today, he lies in honor at the Capitol. I joined my colleagues in cosponsoring a resolution to remember his life &amp; the incredible impact he had on so many. May he rest in peace.I appreciate the President’s constructive leadership to fix the broken RINs system.Ideally, we would abolish the obsolete, counterproductive RFS regime altogether as it is a blatant, corporate welfare program for the ethanol industry. Failing that, we must, at least, reform this system to provide needed relief for refineries across the country.Forcing refineries to buy unaffordable Renewable Identification Number credits, which have no intrinsic value and serve only as a compliance mechanism for the Renewable Fuel Standard, threatens to destroy thousands of family-supporting jobs in Pennsylvania.This important bipartisan legislation advances our shared goal of keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them while safeguarding the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. I hope the Senate will pass this #NoFlyNoBuy bill soon. https://t.co/xvDNXXNvpzIf you have been deemed too dangerous to board an airplane, you should not be able to purchase firearms.Read my Q&amp;A with @SalenaZito in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/Qxw57Qp2jlIn this moment, there might be a chance to do something constructive while still fully respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens to exercise their constitutional freedoms of the Second Amendment.I hope that Congress can take measures to make it more difficult for someone who is a violent criminal or dangerously mentally ill to buy a firearm.Thank you @chucktodd for having me on this morning. ICYMI, watch my segment on @MeetThePress. We discussed my and @Sen_JoeManchin's bill to tighten background checks to ensure those who shouldn't have guns can't get them. Watch: https://t.co/F1uezP2WHKI'll be joining @ChuckTodd on @MeetThePress this morning to discuss ways we can prevent guns from falling into the hands of those who shouldn't have them. Check your local @NBC listings to watch.@realDonaldTrump Look forward to talking with you soon, Mr. President, about my proposal with @Sen_JoeManchin to strengthen federal background checks to keep firearms away from those who shouldn’t have them.Today, we honor the first president of our great republic, George Washington. Wishing everyone a good #PresidentsDay! https://t.co/0zhFk4NgaCThank you to @DomShow1210 and @1210WPHT for having me on today, and for talking about the great work you're doing for our military and their families with @the_USO. https://t.co/2DPrsED5ADJoining @DomShow1210 on @1210WPHT at 9:30 AM this morning from FOP Lodge 5 in Philly to talk about veterans issues and helping the USO. Listen here: https://t.co/Hy9WZI6Fn0It was also deeply troubling that a minority of Senators blocked consideration of my common-sense bipartisan amendment designed to end dangerous sanctuary city policies.I voted in favor of legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for individuals who were brought to the United States illegally at a young age and address other critical challenges within our broken immigration system, including border security and enforcement.I am disappointed that the Senate was unable to reach an agreement today on immigration policy.I believe gun safety legislation should focus on keeping guns away from those who shouldn’t have them--criminals, the dangerously mentally ill, and terrorists.I am committed to improving our federal background check system, which is why my staff and I will continue to reach out to senators on both sides of the aisle to see where progress can be made.My heart breaks for the students and loved ones of those affected by today's terrible school shooting in Florida. Thank you to the first responders for their swift response. Join me in praying for the victims. #stonemanshootingTune into C-SPAN 2 at 4PM to hear my address to the Senate on why we must pass my #SanctuaryCities amendment to protect communities from dangerous criminals.Thank you @SenTedCruz, @JimInhofe, @SenJohnBarrasso, @SenDeanHeller, @SenJohnKennedy, @Sen_JoeManchin, and @SenCapito for cosponsoring my bipartisan #SanctuaryCities amendment to keep our communities safe from dangerous criminals.Below is more information on the amendment that I introduced: https://t.co/USIhg9aNWBThis isn’t a controversial issue. Leaders from both sides of the aisle agree that #SanctuaryCities policies must end. When I intro'd my bill in 2016, a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted in favor of it. It's time for this madness to end. Let's vote.In order for any #DACA fix to be meaningful and effective, we can't tie the hands of those who try to enforce the laws we write. #SanctuaryCity policies make it virtually impossible for any #DACA fix to be implemented in good faith. Worse still, they make us less safe.Immigrants want safe cities and communities as much as anyone. My amendment allows cities to protect illegal immigrants who come forward as witnesses or victims of crimes. This is about everyone’s safety..@SenSchumer says #SanctuaryCities have nothing to do w/border security or #DACA. My #SanctuaryCities amdt focuses on smart immigration enforcement. Following immigration laws &amp; protecting citizens from dangerous criminals in our cities is the 1st step to a secure border.I hope @SenSchumer and Senate Dems will agree to start holding votes on immigration since they've insisted upon debating it for weeks. First they shut down the government over this, now they’re slow-walking a start to the debate.Looking for something super sweet to give your valentine? Try one of Pennsylvania's many sugary treats! Wishing everyone a very happy #ValentinesDay https://t.co/3qvkPIieoFBelow is more information on the amendment that I Introduced today: https://t.co/USIhg9aNWBEnough playing politics with the safety and well-being of the American people. I ask my colleagues to join me in saying no more to #SanctuaryCities. Let’s make these dangerous policies a thing of the past.Leaders from both sides of the aisle agree: we must end the indefensible policy of protecting dangerous criminals from deportation. #SanctuaryCities do not protect the innocent, they simply make it harder to get violent criminals off the streets.Other than in enforcing immigration law, there is no other type of crime where a politician-made mandate ties local police hands when an officer thinks – in the interest of public safety – cooperation w/fed. law enforcement is necessary.Immigrants want safe streets, too, and the bill has language to protect those here illegally who come forward as a victim or witness of a crime.This isn’t about asking local police to enforce fed. immigration law. Fed. immigration officials are merely asking police to hold a person – who’s already been arrested and is in the US illegally – until DHS/ICE can arrive to question or take custody.#SanctuaryCity policies aren’t just unique to Philly. Many of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties have #SanctuaryCity policies. These laws are as misguided as they are dangerous.Philly's extreme + dangerous #SanctuaryCity law prohibited the police from even talking with federal immigration authorities. This wouldn't have happened if Philly wasn't a #SanctuaryCity.For example: Philly PD once arrested an illegal immigrant, who’d previously been deported, for assault &amp; other charges. Fed. immigration officials asked Philly PD to hold him temporarily. Instead, the man was set free. He was later arrested for raping a child under the age of 13.#SanctuaryCities are jurisdictions/municipalities, like Philly, that have policies barring local law enf. from cooperating with fed. immigration authorities in certain instances, even in cases when they wanted to help. These policies hamper law enf. &amp; make us less safe.I once again ask my colleagues to focus their attention on the serious problem of dangerous #SanctuaryCities. There's lots of misinformation about #SanctuaryCities so here are the facts.For there to be a good-faith bill on #DACA, dangerous #SanctuaryCity policies must be addressed: DREAM Act says if you commit certain crimes, you lose protections &amp; can be deported. If local law enf. can’t cooperate with DHS/ICE, then this provision is virtually unenforceable.As we begin to debate the issue of immigration, @SenSchumer is blocking a vote on my amdt to address problem of dangerous #SanctuaryCities, putting interests of criminals before public safety.I was very saddened to hear former Congressman Jon Fox passed away last weekend. My deepest condolences are with his family, friends, and loved ones.However, it is very important to note that this budget proposal serves only to outline the priorities of the administration and does not carry the weight of law. The ultimate responsibility for passing a budget and funding the government rests with Congress.Combating opioid abuse, improving veterans’ health care, and boosting funding for national security and our military are worthy priorities President Trump’s budget proposal embraces. I look forward to reviewing this budget proposal in its entirety over the coming week.This year, @TeamUSA sent the largest ever delegation to the Olympic Winter Games. Very proud to see among the 242 Americans representing our nation in Pyeongchang will be 9 Pennsylvanians! You've all made our commonwealth and nation proud! #WinterOlympicsUnfortunately, it also adds $131 billion in non-security spending, without any real, meaningful offsetting spending reductions. Our federal government is on an unsustainable fiscal path. This spending spree makes it worse.The budget agreement proposes a badly needed spending increase to strengthen national security, rebuild our neglected military, and honor our commitment to veterans.Earlier this week I went to the floor to honor the @Eagles incredible #SBLII victory. From the amazing game called by Coach Pederson, to the perseverance the team showed from Nick Foles on down, this win means everything for Philadelphia. Watch: https://t.co/fGqxrfOyKZ.@SenBobCasey and I introduced a resolution to officially honor the @Eagles Super Bowl victory I know we’ll be talking about for the rest of our lives. Read it here: https://t.co/plRiMLxiU4 https://t.co/8vHkcjvHUbVictory has never tasted so good! @SenBobCasey and I thank you @SenWarren &amp; @SenMarkey for the delicious brews. Hope everyone back in Philly is enjoying the @Eagles parade! #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/b8lnCWGpRVIn less than 2 months since #TaxReform was passed, over 300 businesses employing 3+ million workers have announced bonuses, wage increases, &amp; expanded benefits. Tax reform is working for PA and all of America—watch now: https://t.co/5AlWm0o3yyI hope my colleagues will swiftly consider this important piece of legislation so no other families have to see violent criminals avoid justice. https://t.co/kDJy5zFq1XThe lack of any consequence in this case highlights a flaw in our justice system. This is why @SenTomCotton, @JohnCornyn, @SenTedCruz and I introduced Eric's Law, to provide justice for murder victims like Officer Eric Williams.Officer Eric Williams's life was senselessly cut short by a violent gang assassin. His murderer essentially received no punishment for his crime, even though eleven out of twelve jurors voted for the death penalty, because he was already serving a life sentence.What a game! Congratulations to the entire @Eagles organization and birds fans everywhere. The wait is finally over! #SuperBowlChampions #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/BrABi97OgDWhat an amazing season it has been, but we're not done yet. One more win, that's all it takes. Go birds! #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl https://t.co/DmU3u2ZaaGWith the @SuperBowl on Sunday, @SenBobCasey &amp; I made a little wager with @Patriots fans @SenWarren &amp; @SenMarkey.

I am proud to join @JeffFlake, @clairecmc, @SenJohnMcCain, @SenMikeLee, @senrobportman, @SenRonJohnson, @marcorubio, @joniernst, and @SenatorFischer to permanently ban earmarks. #BanEarmarks https://t.co/36jJH5bWfv https://t.co/TQ7KbmoisgFor years, earmarks fueled overspending in Washington and undermined the integrity of our legislative process. We cannot afford to allow Congress to ever resume this practice and play pork-barrel politics with taxpayer dollars.All children deserve access to a quality education with great teachers, regardless of zip code or income. Honored to join @SenatorTimScott in celebrating #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek. https://t.co/6lrCLndruaThis would preclude the risk of distracting, disruptive manufactured crises such as the one our Democratic colleagues just caused. #SchumerShutdownInstead of the obstruction of recent years, going forward, Democrats should allow the Senate to debate, amend and pass each of the 12 annual funding bills well before the end of the fiscal year.This is not how decisions about the government’s budget should be made. It is well past time for the Senate to return to regular order.We found ourselves in this dysfunctional mess because my colleagues across the aisle recklessly refused to govern and held the government hostage on a single issue impacting a select group of illegal immigrants.I am encouraged that an interim, bipartisan agreement was reached to reopen our government, fund our military, and provide health care to nine million American children.Looking forward to Super Bowl XXXIX rematch @eagles. #FlyEaglesFlyMy statement on the #SchumerShutdown: https://t.co/eoEoafyUBmThank you to all the folks from Pennsylvania and across America who have traveled to DC to attend today’s #MarchForLife.

The criterion for immigration should be the character of the individual, not the circumstances, however dire, of their native land.I hope the President retracts the suggestion, attributed to him yesterday, that America should not want immigrants from countries which he was accused of describing disparagingly.Great news for Pennsylvanians working at over 160 @Walmart locations. Further proof that #TaxReformWorks https://t.co/tAHNxg9RJVI join with my 63 bipartisan cosponsors of #SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, in calling for Senate passage as soon as we can.

This Christmas, say a prayer for all who keep us safe.Through our just-passed pro-growth #TaxReform, we can go from feeble growth projections to dynamic growth that produces new and more wealth for American workers.
