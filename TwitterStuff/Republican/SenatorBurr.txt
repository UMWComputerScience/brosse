Thank you for your dedication to @UNC's student-athletes for more than 30 years. #Hatchell1k https://t.co/DOnqD0BLEgFrom my hometown paper: Winston-Salem @JournalNow: Tax Bill Would Enhance Savings Options for Parents of Disabled Children https://t.co/1Tez95YU0hSo proud of Amy Wright's @bittyandbeaus Coffee Shop of Wilmington, NC - Amy is your 2017 @CNNHeroes of the Year! I've been there a number of times, and I'm thrilled for her and her family, congratulations! https://t.co/wR9cVpAMvRDuring my talk last week in North Carolina, I also had the chance to speak about the importance of reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which "is absolutely essential to fulfill our obligations" of keeping America safe. https://t.co/09OnWzpEaFI sat down in North Carolina last week to talk about of number of issues, including the #TaxReform currently under consideration - "We want people to invest in the future" https://t.co/nvxcbUBLKGVery pleased to see #NDAA signed into law today. This bill gives our troops the pay increase they deserve and provides nearly $300 million in funding for North Carolina's military bases at Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point, and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. https://t.co/uhZh3x3cmaThe alternative minimum tax is unfair and adds unnecessary complexity to our tax code.  It must be repealed to bring tax relief to the millions of Americans who need it. https://t.co/3UL1Os0dWx76 years ago today the U.S. was attacked at #PearlHarbor, in what Pres. Roosevelt described as "a date which will live in infamy.‚Äù Today, we remember those who sacrificed their lives defending our nation, and honor their memory by continuing to strive for American liberty. https://t.co/RgHDuqDFdpGlad to see @EPA taking seriously the issue of dangerous chemicals like GenX in an effort to ensure folks across the country have clean and safe drinking water. https://t.co/X5jToPW4bhThis problem isn‚Äôt new, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve kept Russia focused as the threat. There was once a time where 70% of folks working in the intelligence community were educated in Russian, that's not the case today as you can well imagine. https://t.co/BhmP8kpbQxI'm speaking live now with @SangerNYT at the @CFR_org https://t.co/YDJltDpOis https://t.co/tmC2zYJTd1"I'm very encouraged to see Kirstjen Nielsen confirmed today to be the Secretary of @DHSgov...

https://t.co/NbxF5oyYS2 https://t.co/hFfmBFGBsSThe #TaxCutsandJobsAct doubles the standard deduction, doubles the child tax credit, and lowers rates across the board. The time for #TaxReform is now. https://t.co/NTcm84BkqyAmerica will see real economic growth with the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. Nearly a million more jobs and close to 4% economic growth is not something we can afford to pass up. #TaxReform https://t.co/NVCmYnTOjGThe numbers are cut and dry, lower- and middle-income individuals will play less federal taxes under the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. We have to give these families the relief they so desperately need. #TaxReform https://t.co/RQJmkKAygKHad a great talk with His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan and several other members of the Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday afternoon. https://t.co/0ToPBQVYm0Looks like someone decorated The Thing for my birthday.

These savings are vital to getting Americans back on their feet and getting the economy growing again. #TaxCutsandJobsAct #TaxReform https://t.co/tNjki9gMhl@GOPSenFinance Individuals and families in literally every income bracket will receive relief under the #TaxCutsandJobsAct and by doubling the standard deduction, the zero tax bracket is expanded, reducing or eliminating federal income taxes for millions of Americans. #TaxReform https://t.co/mbezYpQMpAI'm excited to get back to work this week on the Senate's historic opportunity to reform our tax code. The #TaxCutsandJobsAct will bring relief to millions of middle-class Americans who deserve to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. #TaxReform @GOPSenFinanceI‚Äôm thankful today for our country‚Äôs service members serving all across the world, away from their families, keeping America safe. We wouldn‚Äôt be able to celebrate today without their incredible sacrifices. Happy Thanksgiving to all! #HappyThanksgiving2017Happy 228th Birthday to the State of North Carolina!
