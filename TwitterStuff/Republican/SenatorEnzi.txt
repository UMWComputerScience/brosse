Congrats to Larry &amp; Ruthie Cundall for receiving the Wyoming Stock Growers Environmental Stewardship Award! Their successful operation has been around for more than 100 years and is evidence that sound environmental policies and good economic practices can go hand in hand. https://t.co/esOokZdlmdThe farm bill passed today included a number of important provisions that would provide certainty and predictability in the coming years to help Wyoming’s agricultural community plan for the future.” 
 https://t.co/SjJ7kGKCTaThe Senate passed a farm bill today which would help Wyoming’s farmers, ranchers and rural communities.  https://t.co/SjJ7kH2ehKCongratulations to Casper’s Vickie Jasmann – an inspiring individual who recently won the Jefferson Award! She has dedicated her life to serving others, including fostering more than 200 children and grocery shopping for those who can’t leave their homes. https://t.co/lKyhmX4XkWOur budget and appropriations process is clearly in need of reform. I spoke on the Senate floor about moving to a biennial funding cycle. https://t.co/o5arizsQVA https://t.co/1glSN1tq7CThanks to @SpeakerRyan for promoting my #BiennialAppropriations idea. Moving Congress to a two-year appropriations cycle, instead of one, could really help us get back on track to properly fund the government. https://t.co/CSjpqQy0J7Enjoyed hearing some of the ideas at a hearing today to keep health care costs in Wyoming affordable. This included setting benchmarks that hospitals could use to create beneficial competition and promoting telemedicine in the state. https://t.co/Es80NJVT2Y https://t.co/gIVgMfvHYRAs a small population state, Wyoming doesn’t have a lot of competition in the health care market to drive down costs. At a Senate health committee hearing today, I asked for creative answers to help keep our health care costs affordable. https://t.co/Es80NJVT2Y https://t.co/icM6p1NAlwIn Wyoming, we understand that knives are an essential tool for folks, whether they are for hunting, ranching or for everyday use. I am hopeful that the Senate will act quickly to pass this common-sense legislation.I’m glad the Senate Commerce Committee passed my legislation w/ @RonWyden that would allow law-abiding knife owners to finally be able to travel across the country without fear of breaking the law. https://t.co/gmq2AkVG3g https://t.co/QG8kDWNLmYGreat news that the HELP Committee voted to pass our bill to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which would help the nation’s students acquire the skills needed to be successful in today’s workplace. https://t.co/RqjEnVKTgF https://t.co/NSI5JfbKDmThis reauthorization is particularly important to Wyoming, where one sixth of school districts have chosen not to participate in this program because the compliance and reporting burdens have been too heavy to justify the funds they would receive. https://t.co/RqjEnVKTgF https://t.co/tXJO0qVCUeSenate education committee passed legislation today to help close the workforce skills gap by updating the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. Thanks to @IvankaTrump for her support on this important issue. #CTE https://t.co/RqjEnVtip7 https://t.co/Xoa0VJxE2zToday the Senate education committee passed a bill I helped draft w/ @SenBobCasey, @SenAlexander &amp; @PattyMurray to strengthen career and technical education for the 21st century. #CTE https://t.co/LRAkESvbTk https://t.co/QukNgQSnJXIt was wonderful to attend and speak at The American Legion – Department of Wyoming’s annual convention in Cheyenne on Friday.

I know we will continue to hear about their successes. https://t.co/JvnLTBoWPTThis year, 442 students across the country earned #CongressionalGoldMedals; Wyoming accounted for nearly 10 percent of those medalists. @theaward https://t.co/7fdglo9xCdThis is a proposal. It’s an idea.  Expressing ideas has become an invitation for malicious criticism, but our federal government is a bureaucratic mess and I’m willing to consider ways to make it better. https://t.co/vLs0cAd3ynGreat decision from #SCOTUS today in South Dakota v. Wayfair.  
✅Win for brick-and-mortar stores 
✅Win for local governments that rely on sales and use taxes 
✅Closes gaping loophole in tax law that denied states right to enforce their own laws 
https://t.co/uKPbeTOsXt.@SenJohnBarrasso and I welcomed 4-H students who'd traveled from all parts of Wyoming to visit Washington, D.C. The four “H’s” – head, heart, hands and health – are good words to live by.  The leadership and service skills students learn will help them throughout their future. https://t.co/GKIBIvHSwjThe Supreme Court’s decision today is a win for brick-and-mortar stores and state and local governments. https://t.co/7wqKuuFH1wThis issue has always been about fairness and this ruling will help local businesses, states &amp; local governments.I'm glad the Court realized the importance of closing this gaping loophole in our tax law that denied states the right to enforce their own laws and to collect the taxes they were owed.It is a win for those brick-and-mortar stores that support our community and the state and local governments that rely on sales and use taxes to provide essential services.I applaud the Supreme Court’s decision today to allow states to collect sales &amp; use tax from out-of-state businesses. https://t.co/7wqKuuFH1w https://t.co/LzeBaumjClToday Secretary of Commerce Ross said a petition to provide relief from imports of foreign uranium that threaten national security should be sorted out soon. Wyoming accounts for two-thirds of all domestic uranium produced last year. https://t.co/yI6ugOih4p https://t.co/ZJmz0IAlyeI questioned Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross today about tariffs the Administration imposed that are hurting local newspapers. https://t.co/yI6ugO0GcR https://t.co/4r8N6zFskWI applaud the Department of Labor for finalizing a rule that allows small businesses to work together to get affordable health care for their employees. https://t.co/08YuIEOpSJ https://t.co/TOj03EDHTdI led Republican members of the Senate Budget Committee urging HHS Secretary Alex Azar to reduce these improper payments and ensure proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars. https://t.co/CcQxLPcg6LThere was an estimated $141 billion in government-wide improper payments last year. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that $89 billion, or 63 percent, were made within the Medicare and Medicaid programs. https://t.co/3yde8WqaSvI have been working to allow small businesses to pool together to provide health insurance for their employees. Today the Department of Labor finalized a rule to do just that. https://t.co/08YuIEOpSJ https://t.co/8DdEH9jHThBoys &amp; Girls State are a family tradition in my house; I went to Boys State and my wife, Diana, and one of our daughters went to Girls State. I recently had the honor of speaking at the Boys State graduation ceremony in Douglas &amp; the Girls State inauguration banquet in Cheyenne. https://t.co/nuNN7qC1k5Today the Senate passed a defense policy bill that would provide flexibility for our military to make targeted investments for the future, including at Cheyenne’s F.E. Warren Air Force Base. https://t.co/udrgptMfNYSent a letter with @SenAlexander &amp; others to the Department of Labor urging it to issue a final rule to expand Association Health Plans to allow more small employers and sole proprietors to band together to provide health coverage at lower prices. https://t.co/g0MPfpxqxNToday I joined 30 other senators in urging the Trump Administration to expand access to lower-cost health insurance to potentially millions of Americans. https://t.co/g0MPfpfPGfOur flag symbolizes our hope for the future and our willingness to work together to make this world a better place for us all to live. That hope for tomorrow should unite us, guide us and help to make us one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all. Happy Flag Day! https://t.co/94fDa5x2BEThese changes would help us better understand and be better stewards of taxpayer dollars and make our disaster and non-disaster spending more effective. https://t.co/nvslor5ePkToday the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee passed two of my proposals to help improve accountability over America’s emergency management spending. https://t.co/auC8kK8NVBIf done right, value-based arrangements would bring the patient experience into drug pricing decisions, because they align incentives to increase patient access to drugs that are appropriate and effective for them. https://t.co/CYlQfrqpa9At a hearing today on Trump's proposals to lower drug prices, I spoke to Sec. Azar about the potential benefits of pricing drugs based on factors like effectiveness in order to reflect their real value. https://t.co/GXupeo7szBDiana &amp; I were proud to attend a tree planting ceremony Sunday to honor Greg Schaefer, who has played an important role in Gillette and Wyo through his service to the community. Thanks to the Wyo Congressional Award members &amp; all those who helped make this celebration possible. https://t.co/W2xUJfWQHwNAFTA/trade, transportation regulations, taxes and the farm bill were some of the topics the Wyoming congressional delegation touched on in our video address to the Cattle Industry Convention and Trade Show last week. https://t.co/zQlD2u7g9mEnjoyed speaking to the Wyoming Association of Broadcasters in Sheridan at their annual convention on Saturday. I was also honored to receive the Kerm Kath Friend of Broadcasting award. https://t.co/kslzSLxS7tHad a video conference with the Wyo Stock Growers Association last week about how the congressional delegation is helping our state’s livestock industry, which is an essential part of our state’s economy. https://t.co/ajGNKRu6uMCongress should act to expand retirement savings options for workers in the “gig economy.” More here: https://t.co/m2brf9g6DZ https://t.co/VVDTkqGRKUCheck out the Senate Budget Committee’s #BudgetBulletin to learn more about why our unrestrained spending will soon create more problems. https://t.co/D6PeYAD5B7The new spending bill passed earlier this year created another fiscal cliff that Congress will need to tackle. And soon the government’s interest payments are projected to grow more quickly than any other major part of the budget. #BudgetBulletin https://t.co/wn8gHbB84UI wrote about how “open multiple employer plans” could help millions of “gig” workers save for retirement. https://t.co/m2brf9xHvxIncreasingly, people are finding work they love in the “gig economy,” like driving for Uber or Lyft. To help workers save for retirement, Congress should allow small businesses &amp; contractors to join together to create provide pension options for workers. https://t.co/m2brf9xHvxThis trip helped to provide a better understanding of the challenges our country and our allies face abroad.During our trip, I was moved by a unifying prayer breakfast in Kenya where the new president and opposition leader came together to reiterate their commitment to national unity and to ask each other for forgiveness after apologizing.I recently returned from a week-long congressional delegation trip to Poland, Italy, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia &amp; Spain. I appreciated the opportunity to meet w/ our troops, military officials and country leaders to learn more about the issues in each region. https://t.co/4dNrcIiFIKAs more workers participate in the “gig economy,” they shouldn’t be forced to choose between flexibility &amp; retirement security. Congress should help them save for retirement by allowing a new type of pension plan called open MEPs. Learn more in my op-ed. https://t.co/m2brf9g6DZToday on the 74th anniversary of #DDay, we remember the bravery and sacrifices of those soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy in the name of liberty. https://t.co/fFkGlHdtItSoon the U.S. Supreme Court will decide if states are allowed to collect taxes they are owed. This decision could mean finally creating a level playing field for local brick-and-mortar shops that support our communities. Find out why - https://t.co/2XamOVnTxoIt’s time to allow states to collect the taxes they are already owed. https://t.co/2XamOVnTxoI wrote a bipartisan op-ed with other senators to highlight why the U.S. Supreme Court should decide in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. that states have a right to collect the sales and use taxes they are already owed. https://t.co/2XamOVnTxoOp-ed with @SenAlexander @SenatorDurbin @HeidiHeitkamp on why the Supreme Court should allow states to collect the taxes they are already owed, and which some online and remote businesses already collect. https://t.co/2XamOV6iFQAre you planning a trip to Washington, D.C.?

God bless! #MemorialDay https://t.co/RrFtNXBV1fI am fortunate to be able to sponsor a young adult from Wyoming to serve as a Senate page. Any interested high school rising juniors should apply by June 14. Don’t miss out on this great opportunity! https://t.co/2CrF9k5kezKnow a Wyoming high school student entering their junior year who’d be interested in being a Senate page this fall semester in DC? Have them apply by June 14. https://t.co/2CrF9kmVD9Congratulations to Riverton resident Ruby Calvert on being confirmed today by the Senate to be a member of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I have known her for many years. She has the experience and the passion to serve Wyoming &amp; the nation well. https://t.co/dkYoPMnMeSRural hospitals, like many of those found in Wyoming, face challenges different from medical facilities found in urban areas. Today the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to explore ways to address these challenges and differences to improve health care in rural areas. https://t.co/5ZU8VFn2kLGlad @realDonaldTrump signed legislation today to provide common sense regulatory relief for the local banks and credit unions that support our communities in #Wyoming. https://t.co/OLIDE177tmCalled on the Trump Administration to enforce the existing laws and protections that make it illegal for states to withhold funding based on an organization’s moral objections. https://t.co/7g6Bk8CIsaThe Trump Administration should take action to protect faith-based organizations that are losing federal funding because of their religious beliefs. https://t.co/7g6Bk8UjQKThis bill would improve that situation, but we also must acknowledge that borrowing more money to pay for this program is not an ideal way to honor our veterans or help them in the future.Glad the Senate passed legislation to help improve the Department of Veterans Affairs. Wyoming has a lot of problems with the VA paying providers back for service, which can impact our veterans. https://t.co/CstHlFC9pC https://t.co/MvEBlnfgK4Led a letter to President Trump with @MikeKellyPA and 78 other members to ensure the government protects faith-based organizations that provide child welfare services from losing federal funding because of their religious faith. https://t.co/7g6Bk8UjQKThe #GAO report doesn’t just highlight problems – it suggests solutions. I hope Congress can work together to advance solutions to the issues identified in this report.Held a Budget Committee hearing on the GAO’s annual report focused on additional opportunities to reduce fragmentation, overlap &amp; duplication in the federal gov’t. https://t.co/OOcOC8vNBT https://t.co/fRjFM3nKeyWyoming has many small businesses that contract with the Department of Defense and ensuring that they receive their payments promptly for their work seems like a common sense decision. Introduced a bill today to do just that. https://t.co/JpCAzqmj2uIntroduced bill with @SenatorCardin to speed payments to small contractors doing business with the federal government. https://t.co/JpCAzqmj2u17 yrs ago, I met w/ the Buss family. Last week, I met w/ them again. Jarek is a U.S State Dept Pickering Fellow &amp; recently graduated w/ a master’s degree in national security. It was great to talk about his accomplishments and to look back at the last photo we took together. https://t.co/dxO9qQIdwOThis annual observance honors their service and the countless sacrifices they have made over the years on our behalf. God bless all of our service members and their families not just today, but every day.Today is Armed Forces Day – a day to pay tribute to the men and women who serve our country in all branches of the military. https://t.co/exQkNTHLjRMore than 2,000 museums have teamed up to provide free museum admission to active duty military personnel from Memorial Day to Labor Day, including several museums throughout Wyoming. Find out more here: https://t.co/8ltAdlvXBcWyoming is one of the few states without a VA National Cemetery, so I am proud that Congress was able to pass this legislation to ensure we are working to provide a resting place for our veterans.I am glad that the bill I cosponsored to double the size of the Black Hills National Cemetery is headed to @realDonaldTrump today for his signature. https://t.co/78PiKKbbOFThe first Senate page was a nine-year-old boy appointed by Sen. Daniel Webster in 1829. The Senate Page Program looks a little different today – pages are high school juniors from all 50 states. Each session, I host a pizza or ice cream party to thank them for their hard work. https://t.co/smWFtK8iKbLt. Mark Lamont “Mont” Mecham of Green River was also honored today at the 37th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service in D.C. after passing away last year as a result of health complications from being shot 20 years ago in the line of duty. #NationalPoliceWeekWe also remember &amp; honor those officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and pray for those who are still fighting to recover, including Casper police officer Jacob Carlson who remains in the hospital after being shot multiple times earlier this month. #NationalPoliceWeekI am proud to have cosponsored a resolution designating this week as #NationalPoliceWeek. It is a time to commemorate and thank all the courageous officers and law enforcement officials who serve and protect our communities. https://t.co/aCllumBOYOCalling Wyoming college students and recent graduates!

It was great to see firsthand the important research this facility is doing. @IEM_ethnomed https://t.co/HoGUGc7YYlIt was great to attend a mine blast viewing at Arch Coal’s Black Thunder Mine in Campbell County on Friday. Wyoming’s mining industry is a pillar of our economy, and I appreciate the work these companies do to create jobs and provide reliable and affordable #energy. https://t.co/q814MKGdOmThe national unemployment rate has fallen to one of the lowest rates in more than a decade. The economy is growing &amp; Americans are benefiting. Since Congress passed the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, hundreds of thousands of new jobs have been created.

This award is an outstanding recognition of her talents, abilities and hard work. https://t.co/UoC5b7FNli https://t.co/3nAcpbO4DWI was pleased to celebrate the 169 Wyoming Congressional Award medalists at the Cheyenne Civic Center. These students recorded close to 98,000 hours of volunteer service. None of the recipients have been “given” the awards – they have earned them. https://t.co/CrVpE3rOL7I applaud the Senate for voting to stop the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from regulating the auto lending industry despite explicit prohibitions against the bureau interfering. https://t.co/ogUMUJ4yOkWhile the CFPB needs a lot more checks and balances, I am glad the Senate took action today to at least enforce the restrictions that the bureau should already abide by. https://t.co/ogUMUIMXWMIt’s time the Supreme Court levels the playing field for brick-and-mortar businesses and states. https://t.co/2ThbyG4seI https://t.co/nRfP11exoDStates deserve the right to collect the taxes they are owed and businesses deserve to compete on a level playing field. That is why the court should use South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. to overturn its previous ruling on the issue. https://t.co/2ThbyG4seIThis #TaxDay we are saying goodbye to the old, outdated tax code. Thanks to #taxreform, after today we will move forward with our new tax code that puts families first and gives Americans more financial freedom. https://t.co/oig5kvJ6Gk https://t.co/5fCo0j4AfXThat ruling stopped states from collecting taxes they are owed and put many main street retailers at a disadvantage. https://t.co/N2cxJMfVuqAfter attending the U.S. Supreme Court today to hear the arguments in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., I called on the court to overturn its earlier decision which barred states from collecting sales and use tax from remote sellers.What I heard from officials in a recent meeting has led me to believe they’re hearing us and that’s a positive step. https://t.co/jrMqd3wDWB.@SenJohnBarrasso, @RepLizCheney and I each get requests from veterans who want help with their health care. We want to make sure their concerns do not fall on deaf ears and to ultimately get the problems resolved.Today the Wyo delegation sent a letter to Vice President Pence urging him to prioritize eliminating Japan’s tariff on U.S. soda ash. This would help U.S. soda ash exports to compete more fairly in Japan. https://t.co/AKO00Y6rjXThe families of this country are fortunate he chose to serve and, at the end of his term, his own family will be fortunate to have him back. Family is so important and I appreciate this example.I thank @SpeakerRyan for his many years of service to this country. He continues to show integrity, intelligence and humility during his leadership. https://t.co/Wil6lUBKOxThis spending and interest on our debt will soon consume all the taxes and revenues the federal government collects. That’s before one dollar goes to national defense or our other priorities. Congress must come to terms with this overspending.Automatic spending programs like Social Security &amp; Medicare are growing disproportionally to their revenue and outpacing the economy. More here: https://t.co/AKp4fqADf1 https://t.co/GerXQgWFKQIf we want to actually get things done, we need to do more than just paperwork. That is why I applaud the Trump Admin for establishing a coordinated &amp; timely process for federal agencies to complete environmental reviews of major infrastructure projects. https://t.co/e6K2ZgXRBBIt’s $21 trillion now and unfortunately our inclination is still to increase spending. That was the problem then and it is a problem now – not the tax cut. We need to prioritize and get the most out of the dollars we do spend. (3/3)I’ve heard some critics say the same thing now about our new tax law. That reminds me of another quote from President Reagan. “We don’t have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven’t taxed enough; we have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.” (2/3)“I know you have been told by some that we should do away with the tax cuts in order to reduce the deficit. That’s like trying to pull a game out in the fourth quarter by punting on third down.” Ronald Reagan said that in 1982. (1/3) https://t.co/EegfTjaH5rI applaud the announcement by President Trump to nominate Riverton resident Ruby Calvert to be a member of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Experience is an asset not easily or quickly gained and Ruby has it in abundance. She’s a very fine choice. https://t.co/hiOfaiOfmpAs the former mayor of Gillette, I helped these mines get permitted and know firsthand their pristine environmental track record and the benefits they bring to the community.Today I toured Black Thunder Coal Mine in Campbell County with @EPAScottPruitt and @SenJohnBarrasso. I am glad we now have an Administration that is willing to work with our nation’s energy producers. https://t.co/bbdaBUZpVqIt was great to visit with Thunder Basin High School students participating in @SIFMAFoundation’s 2018 #StockMarketGame #CapitolHillChallenge.

I hope the EPA carefully considers the opinions of the Wyomingites here today and the positive impacts repealing this rule would have on Wyoming’s communities. https://t.co/9bQYNfxQfo https://t.co/GceNFWEtHz@SenThadCochran has left a mark on Congress that will not soon be forgotten.

Happy #NationalAgricultureDay! https://t.co/pmK7DWXLT7Federal housing programs are a complicated maze of billions of dollars. It’s time we review the programs so less money is going to administration costs and more of it is getting to those who need it. https://t.co/md0Lc5gkJV https://t.co/CyAM2maVarReforms done right to our federal housing programs could lead to less money going to overhead costs and more to providing actual assistance to those Americans most in need.More than 20 different government entities administer more than 160 different federal housing programs. I sent a letter asking for officials to identify duplication and overlap in federal housing assistance programs. https://t.co/md0Lc5xW8vThe Dodd-Frank reform bill passed by the Senate today would help small businesses grow and expand in Wyoming by targeting relief to small community financial institutions that are struggling under unfair regulatory demands. #Relief4MainStreet https://t.co/UdkmIQAFbKThe Senate passed bipartisan legislation today that will help community banks and credit unions invest in Wyoming. #Relief4MainStreet https://t.co/UdkmIQSgAkThe timely consideration of this project is vital to our state, local communities and the energy security of the entire nation.The BLM estimates that the project would bring approximately 8,000 new jobs to our state and up to $28 billion in revenue and economic activity.The Wyoming delegation sent a letter urging the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to finalize its environmental review process of the Converse County Oil and Gas Project as quickly as possible. @SenJohnBarrasso @RepLizCheney https://t.co/gle0WpVmesFor folks in Wyoming and across the country, tax reform has meant more money in their paychecks.

Be sure to get screened – it could save your life. https://t.co/AAJqRoN6oyMany CFPB employees are making more than state governors, members of Congress, White House officials, the VP and Supreme Court justices. We need to bring accountability to the CFPB, and we should start with the bureau’s lavish spending on employee salaries.I introduced an amendment that would require the CFPB to keep employees’ salaries in line with the regular government pay scale. https://t.co/E6spMFJBJZ https://t.co/2jaZI7AMtgToday we celebrate March 7th (3/07) as 307 Day!
