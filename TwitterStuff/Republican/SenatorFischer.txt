Jameson‚Äôs name and reputation live on as soldiers save lives, just as she did, on the battlefield.Without hesitation, Sgt. Jameson answered the call. She was speeding towards the battlefield to attend to the fallen when her field ambulance was struck by an IED. That day, she gave her life while serving her country.Sgt. Jameson and her battle buddy, Specialist Rachelle Spors received an urgent call to help injured Marines in combat a few miles from where they were.By June of 2005, Sgt. Jameson was in Iraq on duty with the 313th Medical Company at Camp Speicher. Jameson‚Äôs first mission on the road was a long one. She was the vehicle commander of an M997 ambulance that was headed to Trebil near the Jordan border.With her determination, she raised that program into a world-class operation. The soldiers who took her program went on to save lives around the world.As combat intensified in #Afghanistan and #Iraq, Tricia was tasked with improving the Combat Life Saver course, which teaches soldiers basic medical skills for the battlefield.After high school, Tricia joined the @NENationalGuard in 1994. With her grit and determination, she soon was promoted to become a full-time training instructor at Camp Ashland.Tricia grew up in the farm country of St. Paul, NE, and at a young age, she advocated for what is right and how others should be treated.Each Nebraska hero has a powerful story, and today, I‚Äôm honoring the life of @NENationalGuard Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson.üö® SOON: Watch as I speak on the #SenateFloor to honor a #NebraskaHero Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson.
