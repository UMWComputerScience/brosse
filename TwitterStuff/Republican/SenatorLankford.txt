Congrats to former Governor, Senator, and now @UofOklahoma President @DavidBorenOK as he enters his well earned retirement. His contributions to #Oklahoma are countless and we’re all grateful for his service. #boomerHonored to join @EWTN #ProLife Weekly with @CatSzeltner to discuss the #NIFLA Supreme Court ruling, as well as #civility in politics.

https://t.co/Tvqppsl4tJFreedom of the press is not only a vital part of the First Amendment, it is an important part of democracy. It’s no coincidence that prosperous and free countries also have a free press. 

Praying for the victims at the Capital Gazette, their families, &amp; the Annapolis community.The greatest challenge facing our #Oklahoma #farmers and Ag community is trade and rapid fluctuations in commodity prices. Programs in the Farm Bill can't make up for the harm that can be inflicted by trade actions that jeopardize our global markets. https://t.co/FO2n7GYXFH https://t.co/QK4zfKRJIrI strongly support the important work of our #farmers and ranchers in #Oklahoma. The Farm Bill has a nice-sounding name — the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 — but the bill doesn’t make real improvements and reforms to our federal agriculture policy. https://t.co/FO2n7GYXFHSome are calling for the Senate to delay confirmation of a new Supreme Court Justice until after this year’s election, claiming some election year precedent. That precedent pertains to a presidential election, not a midterm election. 

More here: https://t.co/6Lq6Cntng8I would like to thank Justice Anthony Kennedy for his 43 years on the federal bench. I also look forward to the President’s nominee coming before the Senate in the next few months, and confirming a qualified nominee to the bench this Fall. https://t.co/OGrQ40MNJPCongress has got to learn how to focus on solving the issue of #immigration rather than just complaining about it. Border security, family separation, efficient immigration courts, DACA, etc. Although one bill may fail, we must go back to the negotiating table &amp; keep trying. https://t.co/3JFkrTg43oGreat @FDD event today on Turkey &amp; Erdoğan’s re-election victory. I want the U.S. and Turkey to have good relations, but they are not acting like an ally. #FDDLIVE #AndrewBrunson https://t.co/gT3Iqp4f5C.@ChrisCoons &amp; I just left our weekly bipartisan Senate Prayer Breakfast, one of many gatherings in Congress that foster #civility in politics. There’s rightly a need to condemn incivility, no matter where it comes from. I also want you know civility does happen in Congress. https://t.co/ududnSQso7Honored to serve as co-chair of the Prayer Breakfast with this guy. He doesn’t just preach #civility, he lives it. https://t.co/6vIiDDskNKInt'l Day Against Drug Abuse &amp; Illicit Trafficking reminds us that we must continue efforts to combat drug abuse through interdiction, as part of our drug control strategy. I applaud the men &amp; women working to apprehend traffickers of these deadly illegal narcotics. #WorldDrugDay https://t.co/HH1sIS4cnVWelcome home to the 1st Squadron, 180th Cavalry Regiment. #Oklahoma is so proud to have you home safe and sound. https://t.co/GIuw135t0FTo summarize today's #NIFLAvBecerra opinion: The Constitution gives all citizens freedom to their diverse opinions, the gov't must respect diversity, &amp; any law that forces beliefs on people is contrary to the Founders’ vision.
 
The Constitution truly is an amazing document. https://t.co/4Qcfu6lwA1Today’s #niflavbecerra #SCOTUS ruling is a great victory for the First Amendment &amp; #freespeech. In America, everyone has the right to speak their own mind or choose to be silent, but people don't have to say what the gov't tries to compel them to say.  #GiveFreeSpeechLifeWatch this. It shows the difficult job of our border law enforcement officials. As they try to prevent drugs &amp; violent people from getting in to the country &amp; also help those in need of asylum, Congress must do their job &amp; legislate to allow detained families to stay together. https://t.co/IhnfG2TaZ6Last night’s Senate-passed Appropriations bill is good news for #Oklahoma. It funds construction &amp; renovation at the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center. It also has funding to bring the KC-46A Tanker to the Altus Air Force Base.
https://t.co/yFNEj9Vwe4@PaulbatesMN I’m sorry that happened to you. I encourage you with these words from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”America.....  The key is not uniform policy views; it is uniform respect for each other and the process. It is disagreement without personal attack. #civility https://t.co/jy9cjlPqHXUnity and respect do not require watered-down policy positions and weakness. They require respect for views that are different, and understanding that the people that disagree do not want to destroy the country. Maybe they just have a different view of the world. #civility https://t.co/2VsvxltUWuIf the national pendulum is ever going to swing, it will require role models in every community who don’t just call out for respectful opposition, but practice it. #civility https://t.co/I1nAoDzV4l@Samoday25 Everyone has a part of play. “If the national pendulum is ever going to swing, it will require role models in every community who don’t just call out for respectful opposition, but practice it.”A year ago, Washington joined in unity, prayer and civility after horror erupted on a baseball field. We should be able to disagree without being disagreeable. #civility 
https://t.co/UafYkVX0N8With all of the debate surrounding illegal #immigration, it’s important to also remember and celebrate the millions of people who have entered our country legally and waited in line for years to complete the American naturalization process to become a citizen. https://t.co/QOeqip2LtuGreat to join @FoxNewsRadio’s @guypbenson &amp; Marie Harf tonight to talk #immigration. LISTEN: 
https://t.co/adx5ayGVYdI applaud @MickMulvaneyOMB &amp; the Administration for starting a conversation about streamlining govt to make it more efficient. Govt currently provides 20th century services to a 21st century public. Congress should welcome a federal reorganization debate. https://t.co/BEWfQSO6WH https://t.co/uwsz4aPpA8I'm disappointed that the $15 billion #rescissions proposal failed in the Senate. With a $21 Trillion federal debt, we must start somewhere. This package was a responsible common-sense proposal. Thanks to @SenMikeLee for spearheading.

#FederalFumbles 
https://t.co/O13FHH9HknI just co-sponsored the Keep Families Together &amp; Enforce The Law Act, a bill to keep families together at the border and ensure integrity of immigration laws. I’m pleased the President took action w/ an Executive Order, but legislation is still needed. https://t.co/9pMsT5XGeOTHIS is why Congress must still act.

#KeepFamliesTogether https://t.co/ktf5VYX4FdFrom today’s Intel hearing on Russian interference: 
 • Russia will probably try again
 • Other nations learned from their success
 • Fake trolls &amp; bots are still active
 • Fed gov’t, states &amp; industry must better work together 
 • Election security legislation still needed https://t.co/zfR1JAj2BjI'm proud the U.S. helps many refugees escape tyranny, including persecuted religious minorities, but gov’t cannot do this work alone. On #WorldRefugeeDay, I’m grateful for the many families &amp; nonprofits that help refugees overseas or help them adjust to new life in America.Trolls and bots are still active on Twitter trying to deceive us. They’re even using the current family separation &amp; immigration debate to sow discord among Americans. It is important for social media companies to expose it so everyone knows what is fake. https://t.co/z28WjmjhopTUNE IN: I’ll be on @CBSThisMorning at about 8am ET (7am CT) to discuss immigration.The hallmark of the American civil service is our commitment to hire and retain the best and brightest to serve our fellow Americans in the federal gov’t. https://t.co/bymu9pTNSoI have joined 12 of my colleagues in calling on Attorney General Jeff Sessions &amp; the Dept. of Justice to halt family separations while Congress works on a legislative fix. 

#KeepFamiliesTogether 
https://t.co/keVkp5r5bJ https://t.co/ciblOKQS9SProud to join @SenMikeLee @TedCruz @RandPaul &amp; others to co-sponsor a #rescissions package that would rescind about $15 Billion from the $1.3 Trillion Omnibus spending bill in March. With a $21 Trillion federal debt, we have to start cutting somewhere. #FederalFumbles https://t.co/fbl7CJb713Our #immigration system is badly broken. One of its many problems is that one Administration has flexibility to change prosecutorial discretion any time it wants. Congress should not only fix family separation, we must fix #DACA, border security, asylum process, &amp; other issues. https://t.co/JOOWxApR8h@TheAlanNoble @live2worship Hey Noel... I spoke on the Senate floor about this last night. Here ya go: https://t.co/3qmjnIhUGwToday is Juneteenth, a day that recognizes the June 19, 1865 announcement of the abolition of slavery. Just like the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot story is now being taught in #Oklahoma schools, we should teach the next generation about #Juneteenth also. https://t.co/Xwh87jINJu.@clairecmc &amp; I intro’d a bipartisan bill today to address national security issues surrounding the use of insecure products like Kaspersky &amp; #ZTE. Our bill creates a government-wide approach to solving supply chain security issues in federal acquisitions. https://t.co/aYDDBkvgb9Glad the Senate today completed one of our primary responsibilities - supporting America’s national defense &amp; passing the #NDAA. It improves our military and supports the women and men who provide our security. https://t.co/ePIwgTMFT5A bill I co-sponsored, the Secure &amp; Succeed Act, would have repealed this Flores policy, so we can keep   #KeepFamiliesTogether. The administration can tweak this. But it is also past time for Congress to reform our broken immigration laws https://t.co/6PvQQvHHu5 https://t.co/XVOMkAke7pA 1997 court settlement called Flores v. Reno prevents the gov’t from keeping children with their parents if the parents are charged with a crime for crossing the border illegally. The law doesn't have to be enforced this way due to prosecutorial discretion.@hotwirefences I have been numerous times. There are strict child protective service and social worker rules at these facilities. There are many in Congress working on this issue, but we don’t need to politicize the pictures of these kids. There are very real safety issues.I disagree with the administration’s policy of separating families, but we must continue to protect the privacy of the children, many who have experienced trauma. #KeepFamiliesTogether &amp; keep cameras away from these kids. 

Just like in 2014: https://t.co/UveTZAAom8If you know of a father that is struggling or financially vulnerable in central #Oklahoma, tell them about TRUE Dads! It’s FREE. https://t.co/qekEAkSEVz https://t.co/fZXcz90qBs#FathersDay is a good moment to reflect on the strength of our families &amp; the role that Dads contribute to Oklahoma's prosperity &amp; stability. 

I’m honored to partner with TRUE Dad’s Ernest Odunze on this @NewsOK oped. Check it out:
https://t.co/bemPTMI8x8Our nation is only as strong as our communities. Our communities are only as strong as our families. Our families are stronger when Dad’s are engaged. Happy #FathersDay https://t.co/3u7b0iLLG7There are thousands of honorable men &amp; women serving in the FBI &amp; Intel Community. Sadly, the Dept. of Justice Inspector General report showed there were individuals in these agencies who acted with obvious political bias in 2016. https://t.co/azzFRr2vwGI joined @koconews this morning to discuss a variety of topics, including the separation of families at the border. The family unit is the foundational basis for society - we should keep them together as much as possible. https://t.co/by27VV3X4XThank-you @eric_costanzo &amp; @south_tulsa. My staff &amp; I firmly believe in welcoming those who work hard to become citizens of our great country. I’m grateful for the many Oklahomans &amp; churches serving them. https://t.co/9nF2rMl3noTUNE IN: I’ll be on @koconews at 9am CT w/ @KOCOmarkie to discuss several topics, including the improving economy, North Korea, medical marijuana, and immigration.Happy 243rd birthday @USArmy! Thank you to all the brave men and women and to their families for your service and sacrifice to protect our freedom. #ArmyBirthday https://t.co/UW6akquqULSometimes I have time to answer constituent phonecalls in my office. This time, I talked to Tim from Purcell about the separation of families at the border. I let him know that I am asking the White House to keep families together as much as we can. https://t.co/8T0FRBJglDThe #SingaporeSummit with North Korea is a great first step, but it’s just that... a first step. The nuclear threat is not over because we haven’t seen denuclearization or dismantlement of weapons yet. We must continue sanctions, while pursuing actions of peace. https://t.co/056UHzwfisIt seems like all we hear is bad news on TV. Here is some good news for a change. Our economy is improving, in part, due to #TaxReform. Unemployment is low. #Oklahoma revenue is 20% higher than expected. https://t.co/AoMcGLg692Great to join @mitchelltalks this morning in Washington DC at the Capitol to discuss the President’s #Trade strategy, the #SingaporeSummit, #marijuana policy &amp; #MedicalCannabis

WATCH: https://t.co/M0B6HQSjUC https://t.co/zNsTaY7WM8Good news. In part, thanks to #TaxReform, small businesses are hiring more employees than they have in more than 30 years. The new tax code is helping them invest and spend more, which stimulates the economy.

https://t.co/qdWdQejS4uKJU has been a ruthless dictator; we should be keenly aware of that as @POTUS continues to negotiate with him, but I have compassion for the people of North Korea and hope that KJU sees reason and sets aside his nuclear weapons ambitions. https://t.co/3CK6UZYMIEThis morning, I bumped into students from Morrison High School who are visiting DC for the @NationalHistory Day Contest. Glad to be able to spend some time with them and wish them luck! #NHD2018 https://t.co/T4rfQ8j36FToday Senator @amyklobuchar and I submitted provisions from the #SecureElectionsAct as an amendment to the #NDAA. It’s imperative that we protect our nation from any foreign or domestic cyber threats that target our election process.

https://t.co/L52vOgX5GJClinics like Planned Parenthood are required to report suspected sexual abuse. Their continued failure to ensure the safety of clients, specifically minors, is horrific. This failure is why my colleagues &amp; I want an investigation.
https://t.co/bVfoHsSQtTAnother productive meeting with #Honduras President Juan Hernandez today. We discussed the important bilateral relationship between our two nations, and ways to better improve trade and security in Central America. @JuanOrlandoH https://t.co/ZsOUsVbDVzHappy birthday to my much older friend @VP Mike Pence. Enjoy this year... the next one is even bigger. 😉My condolences to the families of those that were killed &amp; still missing in the aftermath of the Fuego volcano eruption in #Guatemala. I am grateful for the hospitality shown when I was there in January. Our nations have an important relationship.Infrastructure help is coming to northeast #Oklahoma. A $45 million federal grant will be used to replace bridges on Interstate 44 in west #Tulsa. https://t.co/Wicooapa6bToday, on the 74th anniversary of #DDay, we remember the #GreatestGeneration and their courage to protect freedom by changing the course of World War II. We are forever grateful for your service and sacrifice. https://t.co/HiyMgpcBE9The people of #Oklahoma sent me to Congress to get work done. Let me tell why Mitch McConnell’s cancellation of the August recess is good news. 

WATCH: https://t.co/olggWVj70M https://t.co/bQheLCdK6nCongress has only done the budget process correctly 4 times since 1974! I appreciate @SenateMajLdr for hearing our call to cancel recess, so we can confirm nominees &amp; do appropriations before fiscal yr (9/30). Its the only way to avoid another omnibus. https://t.co/cdCI4DyhdFIs your family planning to travel abroad this year for summer vacation?

Thanks @FedSoc https://t.co/ghHhNZx1LNIn 2016, Russia attacked our democracy. That's why the Senate Intel Committee has been focused on following the facts wherever they lead.

https://t.co/wk3nRWx2fKI introduced the Taxpayers Right To Know Act with @clairecmc in an effort to make the federal gov’t more transparent. It’s important that taxpayers know where their tax dollars are going.

https://t.co/8T6dUC2LeUHad the great opportunity to spend time with folks at @tulsatech the @PRCOwassoOK and @Okrestaurants today during my time in Tulsa. Always love being able to speak with our community leaders about how they are helping Oklahomans. https://t.co/X7f8AwE9rfOur nation is a diverse country that values the freedom to have faith or have no faith at all. On this #NationalDayofPrayer we recognize the unique role of prayer in uniting us as a people, &amp; in making us more compassionate &amp; understanding than we might otherwise have been. https://t.co/yDUtEmxAMFToday is historic for #Oklahoma. The National Cancer Institute has recognized our @UofOklahoma Stephenson Cancer Center as a designated center. They’re now part of a tremendous network of national research hospitals &amp; healthcare professionals. https://t.co/RzdEbR4vozHappy National #SmallBusinessWeek! America's 30 million small businesses are the backbone of our economy. https://t.co/TIs0IGwZNp.@ReggieBush, I agree - It's insane that we can’t see where our tax dollars go. @clairecmc &amp; I have a bipartisan solution to address this called the Taxpayers Right To Know Act. You won’t believe which Senator is blocking the bill from being passed: https://t.co/FztkYKKo83 https://t.co/YbnH58IgqbIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Iran has been lying about its pursuit of nuclear weapons. As more time passes, the problems of the Iran Nuclear Deal are confirmed. Iran wanted more time &amp; money; that’s exactly what the JCPOA gave them. https://t.co/RpjKjDX83uIn 1995, #Oklahoma lost 168 people in a massive bombing, the 2nd worst terrorist attack in U.S. history. Every year, we host a marathon to #RunToRemember those who were lost &amp; their loved ones who remain. Thanks @JakeTapper for the opportunity to honor today’s @OKCMarathon. https://t.co/bqWwduSzmeIt was my honor to help start &amp; cheer on all the participants of this year’s @OKCMarathon. #RuntoRemember https://t.co/wizgWPM8ncSpent the morning in @CityofEdmond with @KorteGreenBuild &amp; @Guernsey_us today. They do great construction work for our Oklahoma National Guard Readiness Center - serving the 1st Battalion 179th Infantry Charlie Company, which involves about 200 guardsman. https://t.co/ETUkqyxMlu1 in 4 American adults has a criminal record. 2.7 million kids have a parent in prison.

@SenRobPortman &amp; @SenSherrodBrown.... you will like rooting for a football player from #Oklahoma.

#boomer 👨‍🍳Turkish Pres. Erdogan's disregard for the rule of law is dangerous. @SenThomTillis, @SenatorShaheen &amp; I today intro’d a bill to prevent the transfer of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to Turkey. This technology is too risky in Erdogan’s hands. https://t.co/zphhhhznEfMike Pompeo will be a superb Secretary of State. Although I’m disappointed he didn’t receive more bipartisan support, as so many Secretaries of State received before him, I look forward to working with Mike &amp; my colleagues on the many diplomatic issues facing America.Taxpayers Right to Know Act is a bipartisan transparency bill, intro'd by myself &amp; Sen.@clairecmc, to publicize the cost &amp; metrics of all federal programs. It passed the House &amp; has the support of all Senators expect for 1. Sen. Schumer just blocked our unanimous consent request. https://t.co/KU3UZZskhuThe @okcchamber is in DC for their annual legislative policy trip, and we had another great conversation on a list of topics including election security, Dodd-Frank reform, and how to address the growing opioid crisis. https://t.co/QLuYNYkcS2Honored to join @SenatorShaheen on @foxnewsnight to discuss Andrew Brunson &amp; other Americans who are unjustly imprisoned in Turkey. @RT_Erdogan wants something from the U.S. in exchange for him. What they’re going to get are sanctions if they don’t release Dr. Brunson now. https://t.co/hHj7XjcvE5We must reform our Senate nomination rules now, to stop the stalling precedent that's being created for future Presidents. 

If this rule change was good enough for Harry Reid &amp; Chuck Schumer in 2013, it should be good enough for today. 

#GridlockReform
https://t.co/xnFRj86cvoI'm pleased that Kyle Duncan has been confirmed to the Circuit Court, but disappointed that most Democrats opposed him. Their objection sounded a lot like a religious test (again). Someone who defends the right to live out your faith should not be controversial.This morning on the Senate floor, @SenSchumer criticized my proposal to bring back a 2013 Harry Reid-led bipartisan Senate rules change to speed up nominations &amp; make the Senate more efficient. (By the way, Mr. Schumer supported that same proposal) 

Here is my response: https://t.co/LW2UnoWitOIn 2013, Harry Reid &amp; the Democrats led a bipartisan Senate rules change to speed up nominations for the 113th Congress. This Wednesday, the Senate Rules Committee will bring it up again, this time to make it permanent. Will the Dems support it again? #GridlockReform #Newsmakers https://t.co/1edXp9QR9wMUST READ → @USAToday Editorial Board: "Unless a nominee has clear ethical or competency failings, presidents should be accorded wide latitude to select top aides whom they trust and agree with. Mike Pompeo passes that test and merits approval."
https://t.co/0YCwx5ByxaI condemn the violence being perpetrated by the police and other pro-Ortega forces in #Nicaragua and urge the government to exercise restraint in responding to protests. Brutality is not a responsible or legitimate way to govern.Thanks @JoeNBC for continuing to talk about this. For the sake of our children, we can’t keep running up our deficit &amp; debt. I’m hopeful our new bipartisan, bicameral Joint Select Committee on Budget &amp; Appropriations Process Reform can bring solutions.
https://t.co/eNorB6G09C https://t.co/2QJd9mbppJPlease keep the folks in western #Oklahoma in your thoughts &amp; prayers as they deal with wildfires.

How do you really feel? 😳Turkish President Erdogan continues to violate trust between our nations by imprisoning Americans, like Dr. Andrew Brunson, on false charges. I am working w/@SenatorShaheen to sanction Turkish officials responsible for imprisoning these innocent Americans. https://t.co/R2nUhzxDRmTurkey thinks they’re going to get something from the U.S. in exchange for Andrew Brunson. What they’re going to get is sanctions if they don’t release him now. https://t.co/TuqfDIIhjM#WeRemember the 168 lives lost in the #OKCBombing that occurred 23 years ago today. The #OklahomaStandard that the nation saw in 1995 continues to live on to this day &amp; brings comfort to the families &amp; survivors. https://t.co/Bm5y7ujnXfGlad to be able to connect with the @EnidChamber while they were visiting DC this week! https://t.co/S6jvyr1Zc5I’m pleased the Senate has invoked cloture on the nomination of Jim Bridenstine to be NASA Administrator. Final vote is expected tomorrow. Jim will serve our nation well in this role, just as he did as a Navy pilot &amp; a U.S. Representative specializing in satellite innovation.With high winds &amp; dry temperatures, the wildfires are wreaking havoc on our state. To help victims of the #okfire, here are some #Oklahoma organizations to partner with: https://t.co/0mSFbLUjv6 #okwx https://t.co/gsYF6zeInzI always enjoy catching up with Oklahomans visiting DC on Wednesday mornings at #JavawithJames. https://t.co/5Nem90wCUVBarbara Bush was a remarkable role model and First Lady. Our nation is better because of her example. My condolences to the Bush family and all her loved ones.There are major challenges facing our nation that require careful diplomacy. Mike Pompeo is a hard-working public servant who is dedicated to the security of our nation &amp; fiscal responsibility. Mike Pompeo will do a good job as our next Secretary of State. https://t.co/Qy0HQux9do https://t.co/pFEl4xQV9gThis #TaxDay is the last that Americans will file taxes under the old system. Thanks to #TaxReform, we now have lower rates for families &amp; #smallbusiness, incentives for paid family leave, &amp; more investment for low-income communities thanks to the #IIOA.

https://t.co/TieD62nATPThis morning, I joined the @KFAQ Pat Campbell Morning Radio Show in #Tulsa to discuss #Syria, Middle East instability, &amp; the need for a clear strategy in the region. @PC1170 LISTEN: https://t.co/5FycfBWubkI just returned to DC after receiving a briefing at the Joint Interagency Task Force South &amp; #CoastGuard Sector Key West. I’m incredibly grateful for our #military &amp; interagency teams that keep us safe through anti-trafficking &amp; intelligence collaboration. https://t.co/lQ9bHNFR03Today’s trial is further proof of the deteriorating relationship between our two countries.

Moving forward, it's important that the administration honors the Constitution by working with Congress on future military action. https://t.co/HStY74HK5eGood news. @SenRonJohnson &amp; I challenged the IRS to submit to the same regulatory standards as other agencies. @MickMulvaneyOMB &amp; @USTreasury announced an agreement on this today. https://t.co/upMGpM3g6iIt was my honor to address the @AILANational #AILANDA18 luncheon today.

Great to connect with so many Okies visiting DC this week! https://t.co/5zUYDPI6c5The American people expect the Senate to get more work done. In 2013, Harry Reid led a short-term rule change to reduce Senate debate time. It’s time to make that rule change permanent. #GridlockReform https://t.co/76qOYCh988I’m excited to take on the new leadership of the Financial Services &amp; General Gov’t Appropriations Subcommittee. It’s jurisdiction agencies, like the IRS, FCC, SEC, Treasury, &amp; general gov’t services, play a vital role in the American economy. 

https://t.co/EqWYlBWdxbCongratulations @SenDuckworth on this wonderful news! Maile Pearl is blessed to have you as her mommy. https://t.co/lguS2bcJdiToday’s #CBO budget report is yet another startling reminder about our massive debt, which has been a problem for years. The economy is improving, with the help of #TaxReform, but we must make spending reforms &amp; end the budget-by-Omnibus mentality. https://t.co/0WEUsgmks6@freverett It’s real Everett. Absolutely unbelievable https://t.co/lVQKdpHcqBThe Women’s March believes it’s a “crisis” to shut down sex trafficking; I think it’s a crisis that sex trafficking exists in America.As a man married to an amazing woman and a dad of two daughters, I am stunned that the Women’s March thinks that women’s rights are about sex workers. We should not fight for the rights of companies to traffic children, nor support anyone who is knowingly trafficking children. https://t.co/2YThBOp1FQTUNE IN: @SenKamalaHarris &amp; I sat down w/ @CBS @60Minutes to discuss Russia's cyberattack of America’s election infrastructure &amp; our bipartisan work on the Senate Intel Committee. Watch the interview Sunday. https://t.co/WxNBN8nqV0 https://t.co/c3m7otyRLIThe vast majority of people crossing our southern border aren’t coming to commit violence. They’re trying to escape violence or find a job. America still must protect our borders for national security, while also maintaining a fair #immigration process. https://t.co/SmN42fpSfLThe DoJ’s action against Backpage is very good news for victims &amp; survivors of online trafficking. The Senate recently passed the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (#SESTA), a bill I co-sponsored, to hold websites like this accountable.

As people celebrate #GoodFriday &amp; #Passover all over the world, we remember the oppressed religious minorities in places like China, North Korea, Iran, &amp; Burma who don't have #ReligiousFreedom.1 week ago, Congress passed a 2,232-page, $1.3 trillion #Omnibus bill barely 24 hours after it was introduced. Sadly, this will continue to be the norm unless we reform our budget process.

https://t.co/MGoaVW5fRuHappy birthday to Oklahoma's most famous &amp; powerful redhead, Reba McEntire. From a small town rodeo to Nashville, Reba has always made Oklahomans, and gingers, proud to say she's one of us.@blacksitepod @GOP @realDonaldTrump Big difference between delaying HUNDREDS of federal agency staff for more than a year, and delaying one SCOTUS nominee for a few months. Supreme Court can operate just fine with 8 justices. Not so for dozens of federal agency leadership &amp; civil servants.The Senate is sitting on 78 vetted nominees who have already passed committee but Sen. Schumer is delaying their vote. This harms basic gov’t agency services for the American people &amp; prevents us from debating other legislation. We need #GridlockReform 

https://t.co/MojpRwayP3Glad to be back in #Oklahoma this week. Today’s stop was in @Weatherford_OK &amp; @cityofelreno to talk #TaxReform, regulatory issues &amp; national security.

I could not support this massive bill nor the broken budget process that brought us this bill. https://t.co/boQqRBzPKFAs we consider this #Omnibus, remember:

o Fiscal Year ended Sept. 30, 2017, nearly 6 months ago! 
o We’ve passed 5 Continuing Resolutions
o National debt is $21 trillion
o 2018 deficit could top $1 trillion
o This bill is $1.3 trillion &amp; 2,300 pages

This is no way to govern...Today, I was joined by @AmyKlobuchar, @SenKamalaHarris, @SenatorBurr, @MarkWarner &amp; others to introduce a revised #SecureElectionsAct.

(2/2)Today marks the 2-yr anniversary of the U.S. declaration of ISIS genocide. Then-Sec. John Kerry designated the actions of ISIS in Syria &amp; Iraq as genocide against religious minorities, including Yazidis, Christians &amp; Shia Muslims. We must protect #religiousfreedom for all.

#GingerProblems https://t.co/RwvzPeSkdc@trentdream @EWErickson @AutumnDawnPrice Please read Mr. Douglas: https://t.co/CmHEldz7JFCongress still must pass a legislative fix on #DACA, because families need certainty. Ignoring our many border and immigration problems is a form of amnesty that doesn't get any better. https://t.co/WLp08jftYz😔

https://t.co/f3PID7aN8QGrateful for the opportunity to speak at @LibertyU #LUConvo today. 
https://t.co/6eM73gLahoWe can disagree and still treat each other with respect and civility. Thank you @lagibbs84 for modeling this at the #Olympics2018 https://t.co/QSq7wIHL5OThe right to practice any faith, or no faith, should be a fundamental human right no matter where one lives. Here are some ways the U.S. is advocating for religious minorities &amp; #religiousfreedom in oppressive nations like Iran, China &amp; Burma. @KnoxThames 
https://t.co/vlaoY3EsMhThis ruling is a victory for #freedom. @WheatonCollege has won the right to run itself according to its mission without fear of government punishment.

Check it out: https://t.co/rX8wuHarIrRussians tried to hack U.S. voting  systems in at least 21 states in 2016. @DHSgov &amp; @SecNielsen are making progress on election security, but Congress should also pass the #SecureElectionsAct to better protect systems &amp; improve cyberattack reporting. 
https://t.co/0dCp90XbZEI’ve traveled this wk visiting schools &amp; discussing national security, federal debt, school safety, &amp; other issues. Students at Univ. of Central Oklahoma, Douglass H.S. (OKC), Debora Brown Community School (Tulsa), &amp; Southeastern Oklahoma State Univ. (Durant) are very impressive. https://t.co/srEVWGmFQ0Billy Graham visited #Oklahoma often – I was honored to be a student leader for his last crusade mission here in 2003. @OKRelig does a good job of chronicling Rev. Graham’s last time in the Sooner State. @NewsOK 

https://t.co/zKXIcUR3OyRussian troll farms are using the Parkland shooting &amp; gun debate to create more division in America. They do things like this in various nations to try to destabilize institutions &amp; create societal chaos &amp; doubt in gov’ts. 

https://t.co/hAZ4WaUiEUGlad to hear the administration talking about debt &amp; deficit. 

I’m still disappointed that Congress just raised the debt ceiling (again) without discussing reform for the drivers of our deficit. #FederalFumbles https://t.co/fe6gJh4XcYBilly Graham was one of the greatest spiritual and moral leaders in America’s history. His ministry of love, reconciliation, hope, and salvation was world-changing. I thank God for his life and legacy. He was, and will always be, a role model of integrity and grace.Good news. https://t.co/pscDdkLmpf https://t.co/xFXDyjllU2FFA is a cornerstone of communities in all parts of #Oklahoma!

Kevin Matthews &amp; I will announce the new #Oklahoma state education curriculum for the story of #BlackWallStreet &amp; the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, the worst race riot in American history. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/oatnjQkwHiGreat to meet with you all today.

Thank you for serving our great state. https://t.co/QG2YOrmMtARussia has meddled in our elections &amp; tried to advance their agenda in the U.S. going as far back as 2014. The Dept. of Homeland Security is moving to protect election systems, but we must do more. Congress should pass my bipartisan #SecureElectionsAct. https://t.co/VGocf4mwOC
