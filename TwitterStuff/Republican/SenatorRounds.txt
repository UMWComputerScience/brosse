One of the most vital is a provision that will allow the DoD expanded authority to conduct cyber operations needed to help keep America safe.It also includes a provision I offered to help military members transition into civilian life. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in nearly 2 decades &amp; this will help promote military members’ talents to employers across the country.#NDAA includes a provision I offered that would require DoD to report the number of eligible military members able to participate in the Transition Assistance Program following their service.The #NDAA authorizes $716 billion in defense spending, prohibits a BRAC round &amp; provides a 2.6% pay raise to military members.The #NDAA is named in honor of Chairman John McCain. Few people are more passionate about our troops &amp; our military readiness than @SenJohnMcCain . The courage he has exhibited during his years of service - and in his current battle – has inspired us all.This year’s #NDAA builds on last year’s efforts to provide tools to our armed forces so they can fully rebuild our military &amp; address the challenges we’re facing.The Senate just voted to pass the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY19 w/ broad bipartisan support.Happy #FathersDay to all the dads, stepdads, grandpas and father figures out there today! https://t.co/Wd3ej6dIsg16 years ago today, I asked @SDGovDaugaard to be my Lieutenant Governor.

This will allow them to focus on serving their customers, rather than complying with onerous, burdensome regulations.#HealthyEconomy https://t.co/ZL8hZ2hEHiLastly, we were able to secure a verbal commitment from the Chairman to work with us to fix an Obama-era proposal known as the ‘surplus water rule,’ which restricts South Dakotans’ access to water in Corps-controlled land. South Dakotans are legally entitled to use the water.We were also able to secure a provision for the Corps to carry out a project for shoreline stabilization on the Lower Brule Reservation. This much-needed project will help fix erosion that is threatening an entire community and the surrounding environment.It prioritizes implementation of the Upper Missouri River Basin snowpack monitoring program that I’ve been calling for since taking office. This program will help mitigate the possibility of a flood event for those living near the Missouri River.Includes language to update &amp; maintain water infrastructure systems such as dams and levees, upgrade drinking and waste water systems and increase water storage to make certain all citizens have access to safe, clean water.EPW Committee voted unanimously to pass comprehensive water infrastructure bill today, which includes a few of my priorities. https://t.co/ugqH5xml5TToday's Missouri River update https://t.co/kETsDHTVQhCheck out this week's column: Showing Gratitude to South Dakota's Veterans and Servicemembers https://t.co/FGMvZ2p7jwToday's update https://t.co/UAwLUQFRhrJean and I are praying for the students, faculty and community in Santa Fe, Texas, today.
