We can and must do better. (2/2)I do not support a policy of categorically separating children from their parents at the border. Without a doubt, we must secure our border, eliminate loopholes that encourage illegal immigration, and resist attempts to return to ‘catch and release’.

In one generation, our family went from cotton to Congress. #MLK50My grandfather was born in 1921 in South Carolina, a very different time for race relations in our country. He left school in the 3rd grade to pick cotton, was forced to use a different water fountain, and had to use a certain side of the street. #MLK50It would be impossible to put into words the depth of the impact he had and continues to have on so many people, so I will leave you with a story. #MLK50Fifty years after his death, his words continue to inspire us to push forward and defy all obstacles. ‘If you can’t fly, run. If you can’t run, walk. If you can’t walk, crawl, but by all means, keep moving.' #MLK50Dr. King helped to show us that the insurmountable power of love has the ability to conquer all evil. #MLK50Today let us celebrate the amazing legacy of a giant among men, a trailblazer who devoted his life to spreading the true meaning of unity, peace, and the relentless pursuit of brighter days. #MLK50Newly designated "Opportunity Zones" reach every corner of our state- from Myrtle Beach to Rock Hill, Summerville to the Lakelands.

You can watch here: https://t.co/grXK3x4IL7Today, I voted for measures that would accomplish these things, namely the Secure and Succeed Act and legislation to stop sanctuary cities, and against measures that do not. Democrats continue to try &amp; use Dreamers as a political tool, and we continue working to find a solutionI have said from the beginning that we must secure the border and keep our nation safer, reform our legal immigration system, and find a permanent, compassionate solution for DACA recipients.Our hearts are with Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the students, families, teachers and administrators. Thankful for our first responders.To create a brighter tomorrow for communities that have been left behind, we need to capitalize on the private-sector resources that can help boost these areas in ways we haven’t seen before. This is what my #IIOA will accomplish. My op-ed in @USAToday -https://t.co/6w6667GxnJLater today I’ll join @POTUS @IvankaTrump,administration officials, local officials like @KennyAlexander @erinstewartct and investment&amp;entrepreneurial leaders at the White House for discussions on my Investing in Opportunity Act-lifting distressed communities up! #IIOA #taxreformThe Protecting Access to Diabetes Supplies Act, a bill I helped introduce last fall, will ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are able to continue accessing their diabetes supplies by strengthening patient protections and reinforcing existing ones.

Joined @OutnumberedOT w/ @HARRISFAULKNER to discuss the success of #TaxReform and my #IIOA, which was also included in the bill. Watch here: https://t.co/HZXyVevcsvWe’ve been working on the Investing In Opportunity Act for years, and its inclusion in #TaxReform is huge for the 52 million Americans living in distressed communities. A short video on how it works is below! #IIOA https://t.co/3aMLOB68BMAs we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, I look to those heroes of yesterday to provide us a roadmap for tomorrow.

I am happy for the Gowdy family-they will be thrilled to have Trey back home more, &amp; for Trey bc of everything he has accomplished in CongressI want to thank @TGowdySC not just for his service to the Upstate, or his love for South Carolina, or his commitment to justice and the truth, but for being the honest, good hearted man I know he is and will continue to be.I was not on the train this morning, thankful for first responders who moved quickly to help those injured. Praying for them and their families.My statement on the President's #SOTU address tonight - https://t.co/53N0Aji778I grew up in a low-income community, and I understand firsthand what can happen when hope is lost. The #IIOA can help restore some of that hope - and bring long-term investment that can transform communities for generations. #TaxReform https://t.co/5kIhT9BhhQThe #InvestingInOpportunityAct has the potential to help more than 52 million Americans living in distressed communities, and its inclusion in #TaxRefom is a great thing for our nation. Big thanks to all my colleagues for their support. #IIOA https://t.co/5kIhT9BhhQToday the Senate votes on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act- this isn’t about politics, but rather protecting those without a voice. #ProLife #TheyFeelPain https://t.co/B0ls3wp6zIGreat discussion on #taxreform - doubled child tax credit, wage and benefit increases, bonuses for employees across the country - in Greenville today with @IvankaTrump. https://t.co/iiVSfSjcZnExcited to welcome @IvankaTrump to South Carolina and start our day speaking to local women about #TaxReform and the #ChildTaxCredit https://t.co/0SMXtFXTdQWelcome to South Carolina @IvankaTrump! Looking forward to sitting down with you and women from across South Carolina this morning to discuss #TaxReform! https://t.co/KFj2reY39kGreat opportunity to question Henry Kissinger and George Schultz in @SASCMajority today regarding our global challenges and national security strategy. https://t.co/xTtsF9HZR4#SchoolChoice supporters rallied at the statehouse today for #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek. Every child deserves access to a quality education. Whether it is public, private, charter, or homeschool, we should work every day to make sure our students have the best education possible. https://t.co/ybPIeQA9DH#InvestingInOpportunityAct #IIOA #TaxReform https://t.co/w65ROqRgnkToday, I introduced a resolution declaring this week #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek. I know the incredible results that can occur when we empower our families and children with the ability to choose the type of school that best fits their individual needs. https://t.co/jpvsslBazr https://t.co/npiDQ9skDlIt is absolutely critical for us to ensure our troops have the support they need, extend the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years, and keep the government up and running. Now, let’s get back to working for the American people.Senate Democrats have finally made the right decision to end their political game and reopen the government — finding a permanent solution for Dreamers is an important but unrelated issue.Today, the Senate voted to reopen the government. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the left chose to play a political game that caused the #SchumerShutdown, jeopardizing health care for millions of vulnerable children and funding for our brave men and women in uniform.Shout out to everyone celebrating #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek! I’d hoped to be at the Charleston Aquarium this morning to celebrate with some of South Carolina’s #schoolchoice leaders, but am in DC working to end the #SchumerShutdown, extend CHIP, and support our Armed Forces!Let’s vote tonight, keep the federal government open, extend CHIP for six years, and show our military that we have their backs. I sincerely hope my colleagues on the left come to their senses – and quickly. #SchumerShutdownA permanent fix for DACA recipients&amp;increased border security are important issues, but this manufactured timeline created by Senate Democrats hurts millions of low-income children, our brave men and women in uniform, and the American people as a whole. #SchumerShutdownI do not like short-term budgeting - never have. But we have a unique opportunity in front of us to extend #CHIP for longer than it has ever been extended since its creation, to make sure our Armed Forces have the support they need, and to keep the govt open. #SchumerShutdownWelcome to DC to all those South Carolinians and folks from across the country here for #MarchForLife! #ProLifeAlso Senate Democrats “have enough votes" to block the longest extension of CHIP since it was created. #Priorities https://t.co/1oiWG1vYVTIt was great to attend my first Senate Armed Services Committee  (@SASCMajority) hearing this morning. I am excited for this opportunity and look forward to serving and working with members of our Armed Forces! https://t.co/fKbTCp3Q7qIn just three weeks since #TaxReform, millions of Americans have received bonuses, and hundreds of thousands will see increased benefits - and this is just the beginning. Watch my floor speech from this afternoon here https://t.co/94dY5M71Ax#TaxReform https://t.co/vfj90HyVJeLet us continue to honor Dr. King’s legacy by building relationships in our own communities. Read more about my #SolutionSunday initiative with @SenatorLankford here https://t.co/28jz3yQL41Prayers with our brave officers in York County, their families and the entire law enforcement community. https://t.co/ItqJqHLLgJWhile we honor you today, your memory is imprinted on the fabric of our nation every single day. For every child of color who dreams of a brighter future and every American who works to strengthen our foundations, #ThankYouMLK50#ThankYouMLK50, for your passion, your strength, your unending quest for justice, your blood, sweat and tears, your ultimate sacrifice, and for being someone who truly left the world a better place than when they entered it.So while we certainly still have much work to do, we continue to step forward. Sometimes imperceptibly so, sometimes in a leap, but forward nonetheless. #ThankYouMLK50“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” The Charleston shooter failed, and as the families of those killed stood with such grace and righteousness, your legacy shone as bright as ever. #ThankYouMLK50When nine parishioners were killed at Mother Emanuel in 2015, the killer sought a race war. Perhaps at some point in our nation’s history, his plan would have worked. But not now. We are stronger from your teachings, more unified by your passion, &amp; fortified by your words.There are obvious ways, such as the end of Jim Crow laws and the Civil Rights Act, but also ways we perhaps do not think about…ways your legacy has endured, even through tragedy. #ThankYouMLK50But even though you were stolen from this world too young, your legacy endures. The change we have seen since you and my grandfather were born in the 1920s, not just in the South but across the country, has been massive. #ThankYouMLK50Dr. King - I was just two years old when you were tragically killed in April 1968. You were born in the same decade as my grandfather, another black man born in the Jim Crow South. #ThankYouMLK50Speaking with @KevenCohen now!It was great to be in Newberry this morning for the launch of the new Samsung Manufacturing plant. I look forward to all of the positive results this partnership will have for years to come! https://t.co/cj21NPaNiVSuch a great honor to attend tonight's swearing in for North Charleston's first African-American Police Chief.

I asked how he would work to expand consumer choice and what additional steps he would take to address the opioid crisis. Watch here: https://t.co/683shaUvgpI hope that you will join me in thanking the men &amp; women who work to protect &amp; serve our communities every day. To those serving in our great state of South Carolina and across the country, your bravery &amp; sacrifice are much appreciated #ThankYou #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/TUHkXUZzEz#TaxReform is a win for our farmers and ranchers across rural America. @GOPSenFinance https://t.co/nTT26V0wf3It’s been only TWO weeks since the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, and so far ONE MILLION Americans are expected to see bonuses because of #TaxReform. Continues to prove this is an American tax code built for the American worker. https://t.co/2QgbZYt7R0
