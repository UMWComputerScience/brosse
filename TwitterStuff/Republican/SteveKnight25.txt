Support our military and re-open the government. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/QKXKIN5QlkThere are *0* provisions in the House-passed CR that Senate Democrats object to.

And @WhipHoyer voted no..@WhipHoyer just said we should stay and do our work but then subsequently asked the House to adjourn...?
🤔🤔🤔I could not agree more https://t.co/Wp7l2nTYjIIt’s pretty simple. Tonight’s CR keeps the government open, provides for our service men and women, and fully funds CHIP through 2023. Voting against it is voting against these priorities. It’s time for the games to stop. #SchumerShutdown@donteal51 @SenFeinstein 🤔 https://t.co/13r4iX2RvP.@SenFeinstein, in your own words just this week, government shutdowns are serious and devastating. I urge you. Support CHIP. Support our military. Keep the government open. Do the right thing.
