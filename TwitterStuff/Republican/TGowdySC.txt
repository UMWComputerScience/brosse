Hopefully Senator Schumer can find a way to look at really unusual factors (like qualifications) in the future.In addition, Senator Schumer did not oppose a recent white nominee in South Carolina also nominated by President Trump.I hate to interrupt Senator Schumer with facts. But one nominee was withdrawn because of a significant bond issue, while the other became the Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court.
https://t.co/Hoj9e1xWhsThis morning I'll be on @CBSNews @FaceTheNation with @nancycordes to discuss Mueller's indictments, the Florida shooting, and more. Tune in at 10:30am EST.Happy 21st birthday Abigail. Momma and I are very proud of you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüåπüòò https://t.co/JwKFobD8H2As I have said repeatedly, I also remain 100 percent confident in Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The contents of this memo do not - in any way - discredit his investigation.While this memo raises serious concerns with the FISA process, I have been and remain confident in the overwhelming majority of the men and women serving at the FBI and DOJ.It is important for the American public to know if the dossier was paid for by another candidate, used in court pleadings, vetted before it was used, vetted after it was used, and whether all relevant facts were shared with the tribunal approving of the FISA application.There is a time to come and a time to go. This is the right time, for me, to leave politics and return to the justice system. Full statement here ‚Üí https://t.co/7I8AApqvs1Joining @foxandfriends live in DC this morning. Tune in to @FoxNews at 8:40am.Joining @TuckerCarlson to discuss the 384 pages of new text messages between top FBI officials. Tune in to @FoxNews at 8pm.Rather than clearing up prior FBI and DOJ actions, these recently produced documents cause us to further question the credibility and objectivity of certain officials at the FBI.The omission of text messages between December 2016 and May 2017, a critical gap encompassing the FBI's Russia investigation, is equally concerning.The contents of these text messages between top FBI officials are extremely troubling in terms of when certain key decisions were made by the DOJ and the FBI, by whom these decisions were made, and the evident bias exhibited by those in charge of the investigation.This weekend @DevinNunes, @RepGoodlatte and I met to discuss the new FBI text messages and possible next steps in our oversight of these agencies.We all grieve the loss of Detective Michael Doty and remember the three officers who remain hospitalized. Bravery, service and sacrifice inspire and awe all people of good conscience. https://t.co/QAXSCk67htAmericans care about the qualities inherent in people of good conscience who want to become Americans ‚Äì no matter what country they come from.For over 100 years Americans have said, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free... send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me".Those of us born in the United States won the "lottery" of life. We understand the desire of others to come to a land known for freedom and opportunity.Section 702 is indispensable, vital, and critical to the freedom and security of this country. I urge my colleagues to support reauthorization.Balancing constitutional precepts such as national security and privacy is a challenge. Reasonable minds can and do differ, but collecting intelligence on foreign actors overseas is not a constitutional question.Who within the FBI is authorized to talk to the media? We have serious concerns about people with the Bureau talking to various media outlets who weren't authorized to speak on behalf of the Bureau.
https://t.co/4RD8GjpFbBToday at 10:00 am ‚Üí I'll be joining @MariaBartiromo on @SundayFutures to discuss the Russia investigation and more. Tune in.New day. Same result. Bad Santa loses. https://t.co/5scRs5NVjyI was present for nearly every minute of his two interviews. Those "reporting" on his two interviews were not present for a single minute of either interview.I realize none of this makes for gripping headlines about out of control inquiries, heated exchanges, subplots to undermine ongoing investigations, or casts him in a negative light. It just happens to be accurate.Deputy Director McCabe is an important fact witness. He was asked fair questions and his answers were as thorough as the venue allowed. He handled himself professionally as did the members of congress who attended.2016 and 2017 presented challenging and unusual fact patterns for the DOJ and FBI. It is entirely appropriate to ask questions about both the results reached and the process by which those results were reached.These were interviews, not "grillings". Never once was the witness "attacked". Never once was Special Counsel Mueller "undermined". I've never expressed "dissatisfaction" with any of his answers, publicly or privately, because his answers are just that - his answers.This week I spent more time with and asked more questions of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe than any other member of congress, Republican or Democrat. Never once was a voice raised.He also earned an apology from the "reporter" who disparaged him. Look at his work, not his race. https://t.co/3UXrlY6Rqp.@SenatorTimScott was on House Ways and Means, Senate Finance, and Tax Conference Committee. There is no one who worked harder on tax reform than he did. Like the bill or don't, but at least acknowledge the fact he earned a spot on the center stage.

https://t.co/s6nmJltHOeWhen all other institutions we trust ‚Äî including Congress ‚Äî appear to be broken, we want to be able to look to the FBI. I am counting on Director Wray to go back to work for the blindfolded woman holding a set of scales.

https://t.co/9h2L7N5a6zWhile Democrats may want every Committee of Congress to investigate the same fact patterns, it isn‚Äôt a prudent use of resources ‚Äì something they used to be mindful of. https://t.co/LHkcP5jvIJPeople have the right to assume the people who are investigating them at the FBI are objective and have not already made up their mind.
https://t.co/RwQexBCqS0The Bureau has had a really bad last 18 months. This makes it worse. https://t.co/WkoLsaq9ifHow do you restore people's trust and confidence in the Department of Justice when it seems like different rules apply depending on who is in power?

https://t.co/uF2s4LBBMdPeople of good conscience should link arms for justice, order, and respect for the rule of law, and stop the spilling of innocent blood.Today is yet another vivid reminder of how very thin and precarious the blue line between us and lawlessness can be.Serving in law enforcement is difficult even on the days officers do come home alive.Law enforcement officers dedicate their lives to the safety of others while putting their own lives at risk.May justice be swift and certain for all of those who take innocent lives.May God provide peace and comfort for those victimized and swift and certain justice for those culpable.Praying for the fallen officers, their families, and the entire law enforcement community following the unspeakably heinous attack #DallasTune in -&gt; tonight at 9PM I'll be discussing today's @GOPoversight hearing w/ FBI Director Comey on @FoxNews @megynkelly #TheKellyFile
