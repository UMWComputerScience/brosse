https://t.co/k6JLqEj4sDIt is heinous that Indiana abortion providers illegally provided abortions to 48 girls all under the age of 16.

https://t.co/XcrSm8kHIZTrump is right! The swamp filled $1.3 trillion Omnibus does NOT fund the border wall. https://t.co/P1mQauw72XIt is an honor to have @taxreformer officially endorse the CRUMBS Act. We are both dedicated to helping middle-class Americans who have benefited from @POTUS’s historic tax cuts. Read full endorsement here: https://t.co/9tE7acNm8HIt is a $1.3 trillion spending bill littered with concessions to liberal Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. This is not what Hoosiers elected us to do and is what the American people despise about Congress.It doesn't defund sanctuary cities, it doesn't defund abortion provider Planned Parenthood, and it fails to fund an effective wall.This Omnibus is the Washington swamp at its worst. Once again, leadership in Congress has failed President @realDonaldTrump and the American people by forcing us to vote on a $1.3 trillion bill that no one could have read.Celebrating those who inspire and touch millions of lives. Our world is much brighter because of you. https://t.co/xdmHIk2jVfParticipated in some great meetings with community leaders and activists on Capitol Hill.

That is why I fully support @realDonaldTrump’s plan to end sanctuary cities and build the wall to keep Americans safe! https://t.co/Utp8VPwwK6I am urging my House colleagues to join me in denouncing Farrakhan and reaffirm our commitment to our greatest ally, the nation of Israel.I have introduced a resolution condemning Louis Farrakhan for promoting hateful and anti-semitic attacks on the Jewish faith. https://t.co/uZhPqOegtgVery proud of my good friend and fellow 2010 House class member Mike Pompeo for being nominated to serve as Secretary of State. He is a fearless leader and I have no doubt he will do an amazing job at the @StateDept. Great pick by @potus @realdonaldtrump!I'm encouraged by President @realdonaldtrump's leadership today in advancing the conversation on school safety.I just released my second school safety report that implores Hoosiers to become leaders within their school communities. Both School Safety Summits gave our community the chance to come up with solutions to keep our students safe.

https://t.co/Gzwi9k3fmfThis news should make all Americans angry. A twice-deported illegal immigrant is suspected of killing 2 Hoosiers, including Colts LB Edwin Jackson.

No one is above the law. #MemoDayThis violation of the public trust is unacceptable and justifies a new special prosecutor or other further investigation to determine possible criminal charges against specific individuals. #MemoDayThe #FISAmemo reveals hyper-political individuals in the highest levels of the Department of Justice and intelligence agencies using a salacious and unverified dossier to target political opponents. #MemoDayUnclassified!

Inspiring to listen to @peterheck speak and to see so many Hoosiers standing up for the unborn. @wvrtl https://t.co/KXOdTCPNlwThank you Brownsburg Rotary for hosting me today. It was wonderful to have the opportunity to discuss the latest in Congress. https://t.co/vxwpnZe41RThank you, @WOWOCharly, for having me on early this morning to talk about the SLAP Act.  @WOWOFORTWAYNE 
https://t.co/DhFv3ysF51Even on the coldest of Indiana mornings and amongst our busy schedules, I cherish the time in the morning getting the boys ready and taking them to school in Brownsburg. Daily drives that we try to leave uninterrupted by anything else. https://t.co/SokvqeQBDdThe @realDonaldTrump Administration is doing the right thing to put these dangerous sanctuary cities on notice. If they are not going to enforce the law, they shouldn't be receiving federal funds.  

https://t.co/bZBHp96ijyIt was a privilege to join students and educators this morning in Brownsburg to honor Kristen Lents from Harris Academy as she is a winner of the Prestigious Milken Educator Award. https://t.co/m8FweLsZhVRepublicans &amp; @realDonaldTrump stood strong against this partisan hostage-taking and not only did we re-open our government, but we will provide vital funding to the 114,000 Hoosier children on CHIP and help the more than 20,000 Hoosiers who work in the medical device field.Despite House Republicans doing our job and voting to keep the government open, Senate Democrats voted to shut it down. They decided to put amnesty for illegal immigrants over keeping the government open, supporting the military, and protecting vulnerable children's healthcare.I joined @FoxFriendsFirst this morning to explain how the #SchumerShutdown is simply liberal Senate Democrats putting amnesty for illegal immigrants ahead of our military.
https://t.co/dFxOkFfIaFUp early with @FoxFriendsFirst to discuss the #SchumerShutdown and what it means for our men and women in uniform. Thank you @FoxNews’ @SchmittNYC &amp; @CarleyShimkus for having me on. https://t.co/TPpFDw3ts1Chuck Schumer and radical Senate Democrats have put amnesty for illegal immigrants and an open border ahead of the American people, our military, and health care for low-income children.I've decided to donate my #SchumerShutdown salary to charities supporting families of fallen border patrol and law enforcement officers who have died at the hands of illegal immigrants.Wow! What an awesome day with hundreds-of-thousands of pro-life marchers at the @March_for_Life!  Thank you @realDonaldTrump for standing for life. #WhyWeMarch #MarchforLife https://t.co/AC7eujhZPgI'm proud that we have a President who stands for the sanctity of life and will be speaking at today's @March_for_Life. Thank you, @RealDonaldTrump, for all you do for the unborn and the pro-life movement. @POTUS #WhyWeMarchToday I voted for H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, to protect babies born after failed abortions. We took another important step to protect all life. https://t.co/RPlfREnpwpAmericans deserve to see the #FISAmemo. This document is alarming and troubling, and the public needs to know. #ReleaseTheMemoLiberal Mayor willing to go to jail to defend dangerous sanctuary city policies? If lawless politicians are going to harbor illegal immigrant criminals, those politicians need to be treated like criminals. 

https://t.co/bbYZcprmdOIndianapolis is a wonderful place to live and work, so it is exciting to hear that the Hoosier state is on the list of finalists for Amazon HQ2. 

https://t.co/TBQaz05vtxThe @realDonaldTrump Administration and DHS @SecNielsen are absolutely right to be pursuing criminal charges against sanctuary city politicians. I talked with @FoxFriendsFirst's @jillianmele &amp; @SchmittNYC about @POTUS's leadership on the issue and my SLAP Act legislation. https://t.co/6NpAO4lku8The @realDonaldTrump Administration and DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen are absolutely right, these sanctuary city officials need to be treated like criminals if they continue to harbor illegal immigrant criminals. 

https://t.co/b8ZeDSpuqcToday is #ReligiousFreedomDay - a day we celebrate religious liberty and the God-given right to worship and live out our faith. We are blessed to have a Constitution defend these rights to be able to practice our faith without fear.As Ryan practices reading today, we are learning about the legacy of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and his commitment to life, justice, and equality under the law. #MLKday https://t.co/btkLMKjQIuDue to hazardous road conditions and severe weather, the Lafayette District Office will be closed today and the Danville office will open 2 hours late. Stay safe out there.Great news! Indiana has denied a license to the proposed abortion business in South Bend. 

https://t.co/3UNU9TFWqfThe House took an important step by passing legislation I cosponsored expressing support for these protesters and condemning the oppressive Iranian regime.

https://t.co/y6Q4dq8oEKMy heart breaks for the family and friends of Sgt. 1st Class Mark Boner, who lost his life yesterday. A Hoosier, a family man, and a patriot, whose service to our nation will never be forgotten. https://t.co/8360dITy1AI had a great time this morning meeting with my friend and Mayor of Greenwood, Mark Myers. 

Great conversation about Indiana’s transportation needs and what else we can do to end the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/UpmwWvNC8NThis is why I introduced the SLAP Act to hold responsible those politicians who ignore federal immigration enforcement. We must end sanctuary cities and build a wall.Yes! President @realDonaldTrump’s acting ICE Director is absolutely right! We must hold lawless sanctuary city politicians responsible for harboring illegal immigrant criminals.

https://t.co/YqSN3NLz4WThe @INGuardsman are some of Indiana’s finest. I’m grateful for these men and women who have answered the call to serve and to never quit.

This must come to an end. I’m joining my colleagues in calling for Speaker Ryan to actWith @realDonaldTrump's leadership on this legislation, we are going to unleash our country’s economic potential.This historic tax reform is going to help the American people keep more of their hard earned money, create more opportunity, and make American businesses more competitive at home and abroad.The days of leading from behind are over.

This reform is going to help give students and parents the reassurance that their degrees are workforce relevant. #PROSPERToday, I'll be participating in the markup of the PROSPER Act to improve career readiness for Hoosiers by bettering higher education institutions.

While presidents from both parties have called for this recognition of Israel, President .@realDonaldTrump is the first president to take action. #JerusalemI was on @FoxBusiness with @Varneyco to discuss the #SLAPAct.  It is time to hold accountable politicians who refuse to uphold immigration laws.

https://t.co/M3aGieRiRAIt’s time the federal government gets serious about enforcing immigration laws and holding politicians accountable who conspire to break them. https://t.co/OXyNvbJLMYPoliticians don't get to pick and choose what laws to comply with.  Americans are dying because politicians sworn to uphold the law refuse to do so.
https://t.co/OXyNvbJLMYThe American people are rightfully infuriated watching politicians put their open-borders ideology before the rule of law, and the safety of the people they represent.Andre Lacy was an impressive man donating his time, money, and heart to his community. Lacy transformed businesses in Indiana, helped Butler University, donated his time to help public schools, the United Way, the State Fair, and the list goes on. https://t.co/iwdqgftEJy#2A protects the right to defense. @HouseJudiciary passage of Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act ensures law-abiding citizens keep their rights when they cross state lines. Should have a floor vote as soon as possible.

https://t.co/1cLyuyAMzcTaxpayers should never have to pay for the cover up of sexual harassment.  That is why I joined @RepDesantis on the Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act.

For more information, visit https://t.co/S8m4TqHQuz.Today, the House passed resolution mandating anti-harassment training, that I cosponsored. We need to change our work culture--whether it is the halls of Congress, Hollywood studios, or an ordinary office. We must stop sexual harassment and discrimination now.Yet another reason that we shouldn’t be handing control of our nation’s airspace and all flight schedules over to the airlines.

https://t.co/fMM7oBMMbeHoosiers are the best, most dedicated workers. They deserve to keep more of their hard-earned money. By passing tax reform in the House today, we’ve taken a key step in making that happen.  #TaxReformTime to keep our promise to the American people. House tax reform proposal is a boost for all Americans. #TaxReformHoosier job creators like #Nucor Corporation agree, it’s time for #TaxReform to grow the economy and create jobs at homeOn October 22, 1986 Ronald Reagan signed legislation reforming our tax code. Today, the House of Representatives is making a similar landmark achievement by passing tax reform legislation. #TaxReform #RonaldReaganOver 20,000 new jobs to Indiana and an after-tax income boost of $2,468 for Middle-Class Hoosiers. #TaxReform is a big winTax reform is about every Hoosier. It’s about reforming a system that has taken advantage of the American people and making it so you get to keep more of your hard earned money.  #TaxReformIt’s been 31 years since we fixed the tax code. Over that time, carve outs have been given to all sorts of industries – including Hollywood and alpaca farmers.  #TaxReformBy repealing the individual mandate, we are giving the people choice and saving $338 billion in taxpayer dollars.  The government never should have required the American people to purchase healthcare. That is not their job.Obamacare is one of the most insidious pieces of legislation and it continues to damage Hoosiers every day.Elimination of the Medical Device Excise Tax means helping Hoosiers keep their jobs, and it also means the door for medical innovation remains open.Medical device companies in Indiana generate more than $10 billion in economic output annually and they employ more than 20,000 Hoosiers. These same companies spend millions of dollars researching new ways to improve healthcare for our country and the entire world..@SecretaryAcosta ,  Thanks for coming to the @EdWorkforce Committee this morning. I agree workforce development and education are critical issues facing our nation. Thank you for being an ally addressing these issues.Ending the individual mandate would save taxpayers $338 billion. @RepublicanStudy amendment would do so. @RepLarryBucshon, @RepJimBanks , and I are the Hoosier cosponsors.

They are part of the solution to the opioid crisis. We are all a part of the solution to this crisis. #CloseToHomeWe need to help people receive treatment for this addiction and we need to help their families. #closetohomeOne of today’s witnesses said that she would be dead or in jail if she didn’t overcome this addiction. This startling reality check is something we all need to hear. #CloseToHome
