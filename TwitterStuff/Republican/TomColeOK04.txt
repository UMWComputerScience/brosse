I will be in Washington, D.C. working with my colleagues to ensure the government opens again. https://t.co/1DGDAN0KQwAnyone who voted to shut down the government voted against CHIP funding, funding our military and the best interests of the American taxpayer. This is shameful and irresponsible. #SchumerShutdownShutting down the government is never a good idea. Today, on the House Floor, I urged Congress to vote on the continuing resolution that will keep the gov't open. It's the right thing to do b/c shutting down the gov't is costly &amp; irresponsible governing. https://t.co/9M4MkAx9MVPlaying politics at the risk of not funding our military and shutting down the government is both risky and reckless. The Democrats should put the safety and security of our nation first over their own political agenda. https://t.co/0obTIAbEp4Thank you @SecretaryAcosta for hosting me and my staff today at the Department of Labor.
