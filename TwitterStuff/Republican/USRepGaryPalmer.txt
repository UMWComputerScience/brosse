Pro-life centers should not be forced to advertise for abortion as it would directly contradict their purpose &amp; beliefs. I'm grateful that #SCOTUS has ruled in favor of California's pregnancy centers and in defense of the 1st Amendment in #NIFLAvBecerra today.Ann and I want to express our deepest sympathy to Alabama AG Steve Marshall and his family upon the death of his wife, Bridgette. I know Steve is a man of faith, and our prayer is that God’s comfort will sustain him and his family in this time of unimaginable sorrow.My dad passed 6 years ago &amp; I often remember his investment in me, especially on Father's Day. I also think of children in fatherless homes &amp; the sad effects of fatherlessness. I'm thankful for my dad &amp; pray all fathers will recognize the joy of being a dad. #HappyFathersDay https://t.co/wezrpAgxzYIt was great to be back on the field with my colleagues tonight for the annual Congressional Baseball Game.

https://t.co/608QiF6ZkPI am glad to support the CRISIS Act, which outlines comprehensive steps for organizing anti-drug programs and to working to end the opioid crisis. This is an issue of grave concern that I continue to work on diligently.
https://t.co/45S8GybOEqWhile there is still much to be done to undo the harm that Dodd-Frank has caused, the important reforms in S. 2155 are long overdue and I’m pleased that President Trump immediately signed it into law.
https://t.co/pRx8jzZFvJThe First Amendment encourages open debate, not the stifling of ideas in the public square. View my questions from a recent committee hearing on this topic here: 
https://t.co/nVSA5L6NNoAbortions should not be considered "family planning" and no federal funds should be used to pay for them. I applaud the Trump Administration's proposal to try to protect our unborn children by ensuring that Title X funds are not used to end their lives. #TitleXI am deeply saddened by the devastating school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. Ann and I offer our prayers and condolences to everyone affected.So good to have my wife Ann with me at the White House today to watch the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem via satellite.

https://t.co/hCy0DuQ3HdToday is the last #TaxDay that you will have to deal with a burdensome, obsolete tax code! Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, the tax code has been simplified, the economy is growing, and hardworking families are able to keep more of their paychecks. #TaxDay2018 https://t.co/Se7mrlk2pTI hope we not only remember how Dr. King died, but how he lived. He understood there are some causes so valuable that they are worth giving up our comfort, security, and perhaps even our lives. #MLK50I recalled a testimony I once heard from Dr. Andrew Young, a witness to Dr. King’s murder. He said he realized later that Dr. King had done more for their cause in his death than he had in life. Dr. Young reflected, “There is no redemption without the shedding of blood.”Congress held a special ceremony today to honor MLK Jr.’s life, marking the 50th anniversary of his death. He believed in justice and in advancing the cause through love instead of hate.Speaker Ryan has given great service to our nation &amp; now with his decision to retire, he is demonstrating the character and sense of personal priorities that we all should emulate…that our 1st obligation is to our family, spouses &amp; children. I wish him &amp; his family the very bestI will miss @SpeakerRyan, especially our policy discussions, but I fully understand his reasons for retiring and have the utmost respect for his decision.Congratulations @SenShelby on this prestigious Chairmanship! https://t.co/nARhzf65zdWatch LIVE as @AlabamaFTBL is honored at the @WhiteHouse: https://t.co/bO05tVhdyQExcited to welcome @AlabamaFTBL to DC &amp; the @WhiteHouse to honor their National Championship win!Great to visit the West Fraser lumber mill in Maplesville, which employs 135 workers and produces over 130 million board feet of southern yellow pine per year.

The military threats to our national security are real and serious, but so is the fiscal threat to our national security.Millions of Americans across the country are now reaping the benefits of tax reform in the form of higher paychecks, and my district is no exception. #AL06  https://t.co/xLSDaW5ATPThis opening is great news for Bibb County.

Special thanks to Mayors Charles Nix of West Jefferson, Julio Davis of Graysville, and Tammi Taylor for their time and insight. https://t.co/1XzgNjNxOII hope President Trump will consider that there are other ways to address the rogue trade practices of countries like China.While I understand President Trump’s desire to protect U.S. businesses, I believe the new proposed broad-based tariffs could roll back much of the progress manufacturing has made and increase product costs. Tariffs, like taxes, are ultimately borne by American consumers.Significant tax and regulatory reforms by the President and Congress, combined with tremendous reductions in U.S. energy costs, have made America’s economy competitive again and have put U.S. manufacturing in the best position globally in years.Enjoyed speaking to the students at Banks Academy in Birmingham.

It’s now up to the Senate to pass this important legislation for our country. https://t.co/h3gB84sxDuOn this day in 1911, one of America's finest Presidents, Ronald Reagan, was born.

We are praying for comfort for the family of the individual who is deceased and praying God's mercy and healing for the two who were injured and we are praying for the engineer of the train who was also injured.President Trump ran on promises to make America more prosperous and more secure, and in his first year in office he has begun to deliver on those promises. As President Trump made clear tonight, he and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are just getting started.After listening to President Trump’s #SOTU, we can agree as individuals and as a country we are better off now than before he was elected. The American people know they are better off today than they were a year ago &amp; are more optimistic about the future. https://t.co/6UQebbSCA8It’s great having my wife Ann in DC.
