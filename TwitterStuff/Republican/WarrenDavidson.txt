https://t.co/hQjiQFZN3K@kknightabowitz Agreeing that the US and allies should respond to chemical weapons violations, is not the same as agreeing that the executive branch no longer needs the legislature in order to engage in acts of war.2/2 https://t.co/vxz3N2LqSQ1/2 I agree that preemptive strikes are Constitutional - even expected. However, a preemptive strike occurs to prevent an imminent attack on us. This was a retaliatory strike against the Syrian government for actions taken against Syrians.While I applaud the cooperation with allies, how did we have time to do all of that yet fail to even brief Congress - let alone secure Constitutional authorization? ‚ÄúA republic, if you can keep it...‚Äù https://t.co/bXTUomoqLfAre we prepared to sustain this response until we obtain Constitutional authorization?
