They also highlighted the booking area and potential improvements to the facility. https://t.co/2A5Qjt5scvJoined a letter to Chairman of the House Intel Committee asking for the release of a four-page FISA memo written by the committee.
After reviewing this memo myself, I believe it‚Äôs in the best interest of our country for its contents to be made public.My statement after voting to open the government, ensure our troops are paid, and extend the CHIP program for six years: https://t.co/8FjD2HkqvkI was scheduled to speak at the Defiance Rotary today, but unfortunately was still in Washington due to the government shutdown. 
Luckily, I was able to FaceTime in and talk to the people in Defiance about the shutdown, tax reform, and more. 
Glad I could call in and chat! https://t.co/H9YhY1nhFbSigned onto @RepMcSally bill, H.R. 4852, that would ensure that members of our military and security personnel are paid during the #SchumerShutdown. They are working to keep our country safe and shouldn't have to worry about their paycheck. https://t.co/9aB1WNusuwWhile we wait for Senate Democrats to stop their obstruction and vote to end the #SchumerShutdown, some Sunday reading from the @toledonews. An editorial on the #TaxCutsandJobsAct and the economy: https://t.co/1ES55AXmM0My letter to the House CAO asking that my pay be withheld during the #SchumerShutdown. Members of Congress should not be paid while 2 million troops are not. https://t.co/RVQ5Il5uhmAgree with CNN that Democrats are making the wrong bet on shutting down the government. Ohioans are not with them and disagree with the #SchumerShutdown. https://t.co/pjwdwT2B7RThank you @SecretaryZinke and @Interior for doing all you can to keep our memorials and parks accessible during this #SchumerShutdown. https://t.co/8dApTdylmyWhat makes Senate Democrats' vote against #CHIP even worse is that the House has repeatedly taken action to extend this critical program that 224k Ohio children rely on. We can't wait any longer to extend CHIP. It's time to end the #SchumerShutdown. https://t.co/1aLIaYTUbhMy statement on Senate Democrats' vote to shut down the government. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/VLI8q1DCbONYT and AP headlines tell the story - Senate Democrats have voted to shut down the government. Disappointing they played politics instead of voting to keep the government open, fund our military, and extend CHIP. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/97va7sqMGDA #SchumerShutdown would be bad for the country, bad for our troops, and bad for the nearly 9 million children that depend on the CHIP program. 

The House has done our work - Senate Democrats need to do the right thing and vote to keep the government open.Great to see marchers from #OH05 that stopped by for the reception I hosted after today's #marchforlife. https://t.co/hEQE95o9vWTens of thousands from around the country are in Washington today,  standing up for the sanctity of life. Inspiring to be with so many that are committed to protecting the most vulnerable in our society. #marchforlife2018 #lovesaveslives https://t.co/8bO7NsOzp9#MarchForLife2018 #LoveSavesLives https://t.co/TXT49xURkRVoted for legislation that would:

Extend the #CHIP program for 6 years ‚úÖ
Keep the government open ‚úÖ
Ensure our troops are paid ‚úÖ https://t.co/29zN1SitO3Congrats Thomas - you earned it! https://t.co/tXs2IFxaNYWith infrastructure legislation on the horizon, it‚Äôs important that increased access to high-speed Internet be part of any package. See the principles that my @HouseCommerce colleagues and I have laid out when it comes to broadband + an infrastructure bill https://t.co/zIu8VS0ZxaLast weekend's mistaken emergency alert in Hawaii undermines the public‚Äôs trust in public notification systems. I‚Äôm glad that the @HouseCommerce will be holding a hearing with the @FCC to help prevent incidents like this in the future. https://t.co/jFRbGCCR1h‚ÄúWhen it comes to innovation, we have to look over the horizon, 5 to 10 years out ‚Äî instead of looking in the rear view mirror.‚Äù https://t.co/weFWW5KB10Tune in now as I participate in a panel on driverless cars and mobility live from @NAIASDetroit #NAIAS2018 #POLITICOAuto https://t.co/AwdpqZrrC3The innovation on display at #NAIAS exemplifies how technology is being used to improve safety, fuel-economy, and performance.

A great bipartisan discussion about this technology. https://t.co/LHzuO79YA1‚ÄúDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.‚Äù

Like countless other companies, they‚Äôll also provide bonuses to a number of employees. https://t.co/sq3ex7NRhSI applaud this executive order by @POTUS to increase mental health access for vets. It‚Äôs unacceptable that 20 veterans take their lives every day. I‚Äôve supported legislation previously, the Clay Hunt SAV Act, to provide additional resources for veterans.
https://t.co/oxPFPQilzfAs Co-Chair of the Rural Broadband Caucus, I applaud @POTUS commitment to closing the ‚Äòdigital divide‚Äô and accelerating the deployment and adoption of reliable broadband in rural America. https://t.co/9Yzq6M4Gz5The House approved a resolution condemning the Iranian regime for restricting civil liberties, violating human rights, and unlawfully detaining or killing their own people. While others stay silent, the US must speak up against this government crack-down. https://t.co/MIh4LZBRrR.@NFIB survey says small business optimism is at an all-time high. When small businesses ‚Äî the engines of our economy ‚Äî are growing, it means more jobs, higher paychecks, and more choices for consumers. https://t.co/awKkWOgXgQThank you to all the men and women in law enforcement who protect and serve.

-100+ companies giving bonuses and pay increases
-$935,822,000 in employee bonuses
-$1,550,150,000 in increased investment
 
Ohioans will also start seeing tax relief in their paychecks starting in February. 

https://t.co/nHsSF3fHXIDJIA crosses 25,000 for the first time in it‚Äôs history ‚Äî up 36% since 2016. While the stock market is only one indicator of a healthy economy, combine this with low jobless numbers, rising paychecks, + increased consumer confidence - it‚Äôs clear our pro-growth policies are workingThank you @GreggHarper for your service in Congress and on the @HouseCommerce Committee. You‚Äôve been a great colleague and friend, and your efforts on the SELF DRIVE Act were instrumental in ensuring its passage in the House. https://t.co/nYN28LOcqiAnother Ohio-based company gives bonuses to employees b/c of tax reform. Countless businesses are paying workers more, expanding their workforce, + increasing investment. These tax cuts will grow our economy and put more money in the pockets of Ohioans. https://t.co/aF4Tp48OomWishing everyone a wonderful and safe New Year's Eve. 2017 had a lot to celebrate, remember, and learn from.

Most of the ingredients are grown/produced right here in #OH05 too (well, except for the pecans - but Aunt Hilda's Pecan Pie is the best). 

Enjoy! https://t.co/GlkVDdwLAaCBS talked to 3 diff. families about how tax reform will affect them. 2 thought taxes would go up for them - 1 wasn‚Äôt sure. A CPA crunched their numbers and all 3 will save money! Starting in Feb., Ohioans will start seeing more money in their paychecks.
