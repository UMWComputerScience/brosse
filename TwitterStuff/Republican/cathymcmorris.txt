I‚Äôm joining @SquawkCNBC to share how our @HouseGOP pro-growth agenda is giving Americans and their families more hope and confidence.With all the noise and intimidation this week, it might be tempting for us to give up. We can‚Äôt. As my team would agree, we must Seek Excellence, Embrace Change, and everything in between. 

If we do that, we will find unity again.At every dinner, where a shared meal is a shared life, we listen first. We share our stories, we find what unites us, and we build trust. We discover that we are strongest when we work together, despite our differences.We can‚Äôt find healing and bridge divides with harassment, fear, or anger. That‚Äôs why in Eastern Washington, I‚Äôve held many unity dinners to reach out and build bridges with those I don‚Äôt always agree with in my community.I shared these values in @lifemotto and @Time, and I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about what I wrote last year‚Üí https://t.co/DU9iJUsojH https://t.co/eykGGM0dw2We consciously reflect on how our actions impact those around us, and how we can strive to be better public servants, listeners, teammates, and citizens.My team and I have a values system that we live and work by.

It‚Äôs ‚ÄòHave Fun While We SERVE ‚Äî Seek Excellence, Everybody Matters, Responsibly Own It, Vigilant Integrity, and Embrace Change.‚Äô

Every staff meeting we talk about these values, and also where we fall short.This week, we‚Äôve been reminded that divisiveness has taken hold of modern politics. Everything is viewed as ‚Äúus versus them.‚Äù We‚Äôve forgotten how to listen to one another.

That needs to change. Thread ‚§µ #return2civilityThe Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act JUST passed the House. By mitigating sea lion predation we can increase fish recovery without costing Washingtonians hundreds of millions of dollars.
