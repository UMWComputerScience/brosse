Happy birthday, Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat!Bottom line: Targeted tax breaks are bad.This illustration is not meant to suggest that humans can design a perfect tax code. But when the government intentionally gives a special tax break to one entity, not only is the government undermining the Rule of Law, but it also is knowingly harming the economy.We can imagine variations of this illustration. For example, maybe Al, Bo, Cy, and Di already live in the same state, and then the government gives Di a special tax break for "economic development." The end result, however, is the same: The special break is economically harmful.When advocates of Di's special tax break talk about the economic growth and jobs it will create, they commit the broken window fallacy: https://t.co/vWuTVtjDeV. They ignore the break's opportunity cost; the government has deprived Al, Bo, and Cy of a tax break. That's a net loss.For a primer on why the free market is superior to central planning, read this: https://t.co/lcuHhXtS4O. In short, keeping more money in the hands of everyone produces better economic outcomes than giving a special advantage to one person.We could rerun this illustration at a much lower level of government spending, and the relevant analysis again would be how best to tax at this level of spending: Is it best to give one person a very large tax break or to give everyone a modest tax break?If your reply is "give others a tax break, too," then you've missed the point. You can't give others a tax break AND hold all else equal. The budget must be balanced; government spending would have to be cut. The relevant analysis is how best to tax at a GIVEN level of spending.Advocates of Di's special tax break are saying that, ALL ELSE EQUAL, they would rather give Di a very large tax break (75%) than give everyone a modest tax break. In other words, they believe that government central planners can outperform the market by shifting money to Di.What about the claim that Di's arrival will boost the economy and more than pay for her special tax break? Many of the proponents of this view seem unaware that they are advocating central planning, a main tenet of socialism. To see this, let's return to the illustration.The fact that Di is receiving services paid for by others rather than dollar bills from others does not make the transfer any less a welfare subsidy.Meanwhile, Di is living large. She is paying only $1 in annual taxes while receiving $3.25 to $4 in government services. The difference is a welfare subsidy to her, no less than if the government forced Al, Bo, and Cy to write her a check or hand her some cash.Even if the government convinces Di to bear some of the additional tax burden, or finds another way to raise revenue, if any portion of the $3 comes from Al, Bo, and Cy, they will pay more in taxes than they receive in services, thanks to the government's special break for Di.Di's annual taxes are fixed at $1, so the additional $3 will have to come from Al, Bo, and Cy. Consequently, Al, Bo, and Cy will have to pay $5 per person in taxes, to receive $4 per person in services, thanks to the government's special break for Di.Suppose the government attempts to maintain government services at the level provided prior to Di's arrival, i.e., $4 per person in services. Since the state now has four people, the government will need to collect $16 in taxes. It currently collects $13.In other words, Al, Bo, and Cy now get less for each tax dollar; their effective tax rate has gone up, thanks to the government's special break for Di.Now the state has four people. The government collects $13 in taxes ($4 + $4 + $4 + $1) to be spent on services. But because government services are distributed equally, Al, Bo, and Cy now receive only $3.25 each in services ($13 / 4), even though each still pays $4 in taxes.Suppose the government wants to attract a new person, Di, to the state. The government is excited about all the business Di will bring, so it promises Di that her annual taxes will be only $1 if she makes the move. Di is thrilled and accepts the offer.Imagine a state with only three people: Al, Bo, and Cy. Each person pays $4 in annual taxes, so the government collects $12 total. The government spends all that money providing services. It distributes services equally among its residents and is required to balance its budget.Since many people continue to unwittingly promote socialism with their misguided insistence that "every tax cut is good," I'm going to illustrate why a TARGETED (e.g., just for one entity) tax break is welfare, economically equivalent to a subsidy, and a cost to other taxpayers.@Richard_Primus @RandyEBarnett Hot and humid, but lots of great people.@Richard_Primus @RandyEBarnett I was at a dinner event with @RandyEBarnett just the other day. I‚Äôll try to catch this.Whenever one party controls all of government, spending goes up like crazy. This Congress is no exception. Yesterday, I was one of only three House Republicans to oppose the massively wasteful DoD appropriations bill‚Äîone of the most bloated bills ever. https://t.co/KcGWk1mmifThis person doesn‚Äôt believe in economics. State budgets are balanced. A special tax break for one entity means other taxpayers must pay higher taxes for the same services or receive fewer services for the same tax dollars. A special break is economically equivalent to a subsidy. https://t.co/NddHqDt3dBUnabashed corporate welfare that benefits politically connected elites at taxpayer expense.

Please view &amp; share. @POTUS risks making the same mistakes in Syria. The people must speak on war through the votes of their representatives. Our Constitution demands it.It‚Äôs a sad commentary on our politics that people will approve or disapprove of acts of war not based on our Constitution, facts, and deliberation, but rather based on the letter‚ÄîR or D‚Äîfollowing the president‚Äôs name. https://t.co/wccIl2uLvO@clarkriemer Jefferson did receive authorization from Congress to engage in hostilities with the Barbary pirates.@cabbageguy I‚Äôll take process first any day. Favoring results over process is the same as holding that the end justifies the means. Process versus results reflects the main difference between America (process-focused) and despotic regimes everywhere (results-focused).@cabbageguy It‚Äôs the duty of the executive branch to make the case to Congress and present evidence. They did not even attempt to do that, so the only appropriate vote would be no.The Constitution makes offensive military action without congressional approval unconstitutional. The War Powers Resolution is unnecessary but consistent in that regard. Don‚Äôt fall for the lie that the WPR grants authority for ‚Äúlimited‚Äù offensive action without approval. Thread: https://t.co/UOfe7JxiI3But those factors should wash out in the aggregate. The fact that the tallies are so different indicates that something else is at work at the macro level: double standards, selective outrage, and hypocrisy.There are good reasons why a particular person might not have signed one of the letters: The House membership is different. In addition, a person might not have known about one of them, or might have been sick or away that day, or perhaps had a nuanced but valid objection to one.@KyleKashuv Thanks, Kyle. Looking forward to meeting you.@KyleKashuv Here‚Äôs a quote from George Washington, our first president, clearly stating his view that he could not conduct any ‚Äúoffensive expedition of importance‚Äù without congressional approval:
https://t.co/ySYATeDRe3@KyleKashuv Thanks. That‚Äôs not the only power we have. The Constitution‚Äôs Framers gave Congress the power to commence war and the president the power to conduct war. Debates and writings show they intended for the president to take offensive military action only upon congressional approval.@KyleKashuv Weird criticism, b/c I‚Äôm the guy saying the War Powers Resolution is unnecessary. Without the WPR, the prez still can‚Äôt take offensive action without congressional approval thanks to our Constitution. Point of thread was to critique those who claim it does something it does not.Witness the hypocrisy that our two-party system breeds: Check out these similar letters warning the president about commencing offensive strikes against Syria without congressional approval.

OK, I was for it. Did it go poorly? Oh, I was against that the whole time.‚Äù https://t.co/KSN2rsvgebYou can read the War Powers Resolution here: https://t.co/0LLDYKOnRk.The War Powers Resolution does not confer any new authority on the president to take offensive military action without congressional approval (nor could it). It instead checks the president when he enters our Armed Forces into hostilities for constitutionally permissible reasons.If there is an attack on our country, we expect the president to respond swiftly. The War Powers Resolution therefore gives him 60-90 days. The Framers of the Constitution agreed that the president should have the ‚Äúpower to repel sudden attacks‚Äù without congressional approval.The War Powers Resolution does provide a 60-90 day timeline, but that‚Äôs to account for situations implicating ¬ß1541(c)(3), ‚Äúa national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.‚ÄùWhy then do some people say the president always has 60-90 days before needing approval? It probably stems, in most cases, from a misreading of (or failure to read in part or entirety) the War Powers Resolution.Read (1), (2), and (3) carefully. Is there any suggestion that the president can take *offensive* military action without congressional approval? No. The only situation in which he may dispense with congressional approval is to *defend* against a sudden attack on our country.‚Ä¶in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.Read the War Powers Resolution:

¬ß1541(c) Presidential executive power as Commander-in-Chief; limitation

The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement‚Ä¶You‚Äôre going to hear and read the false, tired assertion that the War Powers Resolution (or Act) allows the president to take offensive military action without congressional approval for 60-90 days. Here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs not true:Congress hasn't authorized war against Syria. Unless Pres Trump expects imminent attack on U.S., use of force is unconstitutional &amp; illegal. https://t.co/AY3EiVhGFq@THEBenWilhelm @RepThomasMassie No problem. And remember that no statute can override the Constitution anyway.@THEBenWilhelm @RepThomasMassie War Powers Resolution doesn‚Äôt permit entering forces into hostilities except ‚Äúpursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.‚Äù@THEBenWilhelm @RepThomasMassie Ben, thanks, but that‚Äôs incorrect. There‚Äôs no such exception in the Constitution.‚ÄúThe Constitution vests the power of declaring War with Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they shall have deliberated upon the subject, and authorised such a measure.‚Äù

Without virtue, liberty dies.Partisan politics, misleading or emotional bill titles, and 4D chess theories are manifestations of the same lie‚Äîthat the text of the Constitution, the text of legislation, and plain facts do not matter; what matters is what you want to believe. From this comes hypocrisy.The only way to restore limited government, economic freedom, and individual liberty is to stop falling for the lie.The omnibus is one of the worst‚Äîand most costly‚Äîpieces of legislation ever to become law. Period. That's why I voted no.@KathySc65174870 No, I mean that Congress could pass a new appropriations bill to override the current one, or Congress could pass a supplemental appropriations bill. The president would have to sign such a measure into law; until then, he must follow what he just signed.@KathySc65174870 This is sound advice.@KathySc65174870 A new appropriations bill will be due September 30. Without further congressional action, the president must expend amounts from the Treasury in accordance with the law he just signed. It is one of the biggest spending increases in history.@camillevaldez10 What you‚Äôre posting is completely false. An omnibus is signed by the president because it‚Äôs a law, which requires a presidential signature. A budget is not signed by the president because it‚Äôs not a law.@camillevaldez10 No link can alter reality.A law can exist for any duration. Appropriations (spending) laws are generally annual or shorter. Discretionary does not mean at the president‚Äôs discretion; it means Congress must appropriate periodically (annually) or the funding runs out. Mandatory spending keeps going. https://t.co/3jJhok6wa3@camillevaldez10 You are literally making this up. Both of your claims are false.Another bogus claim is that this letter (https://t.co/eqaeSSxx8C) means president can repurpose approps as he likes. It means no such thing. Omnibus lets him designate some global health activity spending as emergency, so it won‚Äôt count toward spending cap. This letter does that.#GoBlue! #FinalFour!I keep seeing the same absurd claim going around on social media‚Äîthat the omnibus is not so bad because it‚Äôs not a budget. This is totally backward. The omnibus is law; a budget is not. A bad budget is irresponsible but toothless. The omnibus (spending bill) does the real damage.@RenaeCartierM No, that is not true.‚ÄúEvery Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄîConstitution, Art. I, ¬ß7@vanvalkt Our tax dollars should not fund it. The president promised that Mexico would pay for it.@vanvalkt The final version, which was substantially similar to the prior versions, was available several days before the vote. There were no handwritten additions; I believe you‚Äôre thinking of an earlier Senate vote. The process was not good but nothing like the absurd omnibus process.@vanvalkt That wasn‚Äôt similar. The main form of the tax cut bill was available for a few weeks, and it was significantly shorter than the omnibus. We were given enough time to read and understand it. That bill was also roughly one-tenth the dollar value of the omnibus.He signed it on the eighth anniversary of #Obamacare‚Äôs signing. https://t.co/WYncQW8Aqz‚ÄúNational security‚Äù and ‚Äúmilitary funding‚Äù are the excuses Republican elected officials have used for decades to support massive spending bills and bigger government.House leaders gave us less than 15 hours to review that pile before the first procedural vote on the bill. They should be ashamed. https://t.co/wnnfhVymEUIf you‚Äôre wondering who voted yes and who voted no on the disastrous #omnibus bill, here are the roll calls:
House: https://t.co/SGVYfJSiJo
Senate: https://t.co/1XizrKMxMK@JakeSherman Each member of Congress has a duty to review and analyze the current legislation. We don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true or how the various parts interact without reading and understanding the bill. And there‚Äôs plenty of new stuff in there.@JakeSherman Still working through it. Plus, it‚Äôs not just about reading; we have to understand the meaning and consequences of the various provisions.https://t.co/PGz6QOKhhw https://t.co/ZNeAJfmakhThis #omnibus bill is the swampiest thing I‚Äôve ever seen in Washington (and I‚Äôve seen a lot of garbage come through Congress). Will @POTUS @realDonaldTrump sign it or veto it?DO NOT CONGRATULATE https://t.co/lewoBvO4xO#tbt https://t.co/hwZSLnOxigThey lied. https://t.co/mfMUmWvATDIt hasn't been considered on the floor or gone through committee, yet leadership has suddenly stuck it into the #omnibus‚Äîalong with numerous other bills. These shameless tactics decimate public trust (whatever is left) in Congress and do lasting institutional damage to the House.It's official: Tacked onto the end of the #omnibus is a 32-page bill that radically changes the way foreign governments can get electronic data from U.S. companies. https://t.co/2ehfNRIvGWHouse leaders have scheduled this vote to occur less than 17 hours after the bill was made available.

@SpeakerRyan and @NancyPelosi agree: ‚ÄúWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.‚Äù https://t.co/PGz6QOKhhw‚ÄúOpen up the process. Let people participate.‚Ä¶[W]hen we rush to pass bills a lot of us do not understand‚Äîwe are not doing our job. Only a fully functioning House can truly represent the people.‚Äù
‚Äî@SpeakerRyan, 10/29/15 https://t.co/75nsTCPflfWith all due respect, this is an absurd statement. https://t.co/4OAtesmYAE@AlmostMedia Thanks.One bill. 2,232 pages of big government.
