We’re working hard to get the Alaska LNG project going, which is designed to move more than 20 million metric tons of LNG each year. #EnergyAccessGlobal access to sustainable energy is truly within our reach, and it was a privilege to kick off a discussion on the 3rd day of the @WGC2018 on why access is so critically important, regardless of where you live. https://t.co/Mb5zADrTUoMy statement on Justice Kennedy announcing his retirement: https://t.co/svr3dbWUi6The importance of icebreakers increases as sea ice diminishes &amp; marine traffic increases, especially since the Arctic is becoming increasingly desirable for exploration of oil, gas &amp; minerals. Our country needs a fleet of icebreakers to adequately meet Arctic mission demands.I'm pleased that full funding for the design/construction of the 1st heavy polar icebreaker was included in Senate Approps Cmte’s Homeland Security FY19 bill since 3 countries announced their commitment to building new icebreakers (China, Canada, &amp; Norway) https://t.co/A6mZThnNIYI am so glad to see the ruling to reunite all children that have been separated from their parents within 30 days.

It’s imperative that our seafood industry, one of the economic drivers of our state, has the ability to continue competitively exporting their products all over the world.I'm very concerned about the impact that China’s tariffs on American seafood will have on Alaska’s economy. In 2017 alone, Alaska seafood exports were worth $3.45 billion w/ nearly $1 billion was exported to China.I had a great time watching my colleagues compete in the annual #CongressionalBaseballGame this week- a great, bipartisan tradition that originated in the early 1900s! https://t.co/EQ06pNxcZlIn conjunction with #MensHealthWeek, the Men’s Health Network organized the 21st Annual Congressional Health Screening here on the Hill.

If we are really focused on lowering our levels of emissions, using helicopters defeats the purpose.During a Defense Appropriations hearing on the Air Force budget I asked Secretary Wilson on how Air Force plans to address housing for additional USAF members &amp; families associated w/ F-35 beddown at Eielson AFB. https://t.co/7bsNMCbJ9oIn a Homeland Security Appropriations Submte hearing to examine the flow of opioids &amp; other drugs into the U.S., I stressed the need to focus on smaller ports of entry being utilized by traffickers, like airports and ports in Alaska. https://t.co/aWEYErbSo1During an Interior Appropriations Subcommittee hearing to examine the EPA’s budget request for the upcoming fiscal yr, we reviewed programs within the EPA to ensure taxpayer dollars are used responsibly and that the Agency is able to carry out their work. https://t.co/V3i4F8VZxpI voted to pass a res. regarding net neutrality so that we can reset the discussion &amp; move beyond the politics at play to what is really needed—lasting legislation that'll provide certainty &amp; move us beyond shifting regulatory standards. Watch my statement on net neutrality here: https://t.co/rxV5S96OjyInstead of seeing articles on efforts to return EPA to its core mission I'm reading about Pruitt's interactions w/ reps of industries he regulates, for example. Some are undoubtedly a result of the 'gotcha' age, but there are also legitimate questions that need to be answered.During an Interior Approps hearing on EPA budget, I told Pruitt I’m concerned these important policy efforts are being overshadowed because of a series of issues related to him and his management of the Agency.I’m pleased @EPA is reversing course on actions taken by previous admin that clearly stepped far beyond the bounds of what was intended when statutes were written: efforts to rewrite WOTUS, a common-sense approach to use of small, remote incinerators &amp; avoiding duplicate regs.@EPAScottPruitt has said that he is working to return the @EPA to its core mission of ensuring clean water, clean air, and clean land. He has also stated a desire to treat states as equal partners rather than as adversaries and has promoted a cooperative federalism approach.Right now, I’m chairing an Interior Appropriations Subcommittee hearing to review the FY19 budget request for the @EPA w/ @EPAScottPruitt testifying.

Tara is a strong, female Native leader, ready to take charge.Tara Sweeney is qualified for this position &amp; is going to be the person to challenge the status quo for everyone in Indian Country. This nom is a critical step by the administration. Let's make history by confirming the first Alaska Native to this position.As AFN Co-Chair, Tara sought to be inclusive &amp; transparent in an organization that's had many differing opinions &amp; views. But with her sense of purpose and determination, she worked collaboratively to improve the common goal of bettering the lives of the Alaska Native people.I would like extend my congratulations &amp; full support to Tara Sweeney.

The challenge is immense, certainly. So is the opportunity for change.AK paints an extreme picture of the energy challenges faced by many living in remote communities. Rural Alaskans pay more than twice as much to heat their homes than folks in the Lower 48, sometimes forcing them to choose between feeding their family or keeping them warm.Today I chaired an ENR hearing to discuss the opportunities that exist to help bring those communities more affordable, more reliable, and increasingly clean energy. https://t.co/aFyhTJpAy8Welcomed announcement from the Interior Department today.

Denali tops the list in AK for DM, but the most dangerous part, Polychrome Pass, doesn’t make the list.  It’s just now being studied.The problem of deferred maintenance in our national parks has gone on for so long. Think of it like a homeowner --it's now the sink that no longer works because of a failure in the plumbing line, the carpet that has worn through to the subfloor &amp; the roof with gaping holes in it. https://t.co/P829qoS0b6I believe our parks are worth protecting and welcome their contribution to our economy, but we also need to recognize this is a multi-faceted problem, that will take more than just federal dollars to resolve over the long-term.As @NatlParkService moves into its 2nd century, the deferred maintenance backlog now at $11.6 billion, is one of the most significant challenges to its ability to provide quality visitor experiences. https://t.co/D4HUbFRYtHWatch Live: I’m chairing an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing to examine deferred maintenance and operational needs of the National Park Service.
