https://t.co/rI5bcoWwLpI’m not only one who realizes that many Republicans who don’t agree with everything Trump does are moved to support him because they feel he is often unfairly attacked.

Because we can never again go back to policy of either separating families or releasing everyone. Yes,separating families is cruel. But so is release policy that incentivizes adults to unlawfully cross border with kids https://t.co/AkJHctj4toShould pass bill we filed asap. It creates capacity to hold families together,sets standards for family detention,hires judges to speed up their hearing process,but also ends the release policy that enticed parents to bring children on dangerous journey to unlawfully enter U.S.Visited Homestead shelter for migrant children.

But we MUST also end the cruel policies which incentivize parents to bring kids here on such a dangerous journey. https://t.co/rr3jH2N2UuWow what a surprise!

The vicious treatment of her over the last day is a reminder of how Trump Derangement Syndrome,where hatred for him justifies everything,has become an epidemic. Totally lunacy everywhere!!!We are AMERICA which means no matter the legality of their entry we MUST meet a higher standard in our treatment of vulnerable migrants,especially children. But we MUST also end the policies incentivizing adults to bring children on dangerous journey to unlawfully enter the U.S.ELISHA was filled with his spirit; He worked twice as many marvels &amp; and every utterance of his mouth was wonderful.

At least John Oliver is standing up to them after he was censored in #China for mocking Chinese censorship. Most movie studios censor themselves to they can distribute films in China.  https://t.co/02JSXBv4SJEarlier today I spoke on the Senate Floor about our immigration issues and the need for Congress to act if we want to enforce the law &amp; also keep families together. Watch here: https://t.co/RlY78TZiAOI support a generous immigration system. I support responsibly accommodating those who came years ago as children &amp; those who have been here a long time. But a policy which basically says if you unlawfully enter with children you will likely get to stay forever is irresponsibleBased on Senate speeches Democrat position is: Don’t detain children; Don’t detain their parents either so we don’t separate families &amp;; Don’t deport them if they fail to appear for subsequent hearing. So basically if you enter unlawfully with children we won’t enforce the law?Great news! The world is waking up to the #China threat. #Britain just held up a China aerospace deal over national security. This is why instead of a trade fight with Europe we should have teamed up with them to confront China together. #TheftTax  https://t.co/dbCaz9XDfqWish big business backing #China on tariffs would realize if we continue to allow them to steal our innovations soon they will be shut out of China &amp; have to compete against companies that stole their tech &amp; are backed by low interest loans from China gov https://t.co/AMtZ3EiYQ6The tariffs on #China are a #TheftTax &amp; frankly could be more. China is stealing between $300 &amp; $600 BILLION a year of American intellectual property. Enough is enough.  https://t.co/v4q67qxWuWHow exactly does helping save #ZTE give us leverage in broader negotiations with China? Giving in to their demands doesn’t create leverage, it emboldens them to see us as bluffers.

Matthew 6: 9-13Just heard Senate colleague on floor say U.S. detains immigrant children “indefinitely &amp; indiscriminately”. That is just PATENTLY FALSE. They are entitled to due process hearing so not indefinite. And only applies to those who enter U.S. unlawfully so its not indiscriminate.Some Democrats now even using the disingenuous “indefinite detention” term. They know full well that those who unlawfully enter the U.S. are not held indefinitely. They are entitled to a due process hearing &amp; our new bill hires more judges to speed up that process.The ink isn’t even dry on the new executive order ending separation policy &amp; some Democrats already arguing that keeping families together isn’t enough. Now they want them &amp; their parents released after unlawful entry knowing full well that high % will never appear for hearingIt is cruel to separate families. But it’s also cruel &amp; irresponsible to return to policy that encourages bringing children on a very dangerous journey. Our bill will change the law so families will remain together while awaiting prioritized proceedings.  https://t.co/e1nTp60q4pBill was just filed led by @SenThomTillis &amp; many others like @SenatorFischer The executive order today does NOT take away the need for Congress to act. We need to get rid of the “Flores Settlement” or a court ruling could lead to same problem again. https://t.co/yvun8XyMcyJust filed the Keep Families Together Act. While todays reversal of decision to separate families is good,it will be challenged in court. Lets pass our law &amp; get rid of “Flores Settlement” so adverse court decision doesn’t put us right back in same place. https://t.co/ndgalFkjoBPresident just announced the White House is going to do something to keep families together after unlawful entry. Waiting to see what it is. Meanwhile #ZTE issue is also heating up again, will be on Facebook Live at 12:30pm Eastern to discuss.  https://t.co/SN8390EYZeRecently, I admitted that I was wrong about a bill I voted for while in the Florida Legislature. Here’s why my new bill makes more sense: https://t.co/ckyqhAzlQV#ZTE poses a threat to entire U.S. telecommunication network not just our govt. #China already steals $300 billion a year from us,why would we allow them to stay in business &amp; continue to embed internet routers &amp; other key components into our networks? https://t.co/SRjaUcvIGlReturning to a policy that only adults with children are released would create an incentive to bring kids. Yes separating families is cruel,but so is a policy that encourages parents to bring their kids on a dangerous journey.

Trump policy on this is headed in right direction https://t.co/8PztoQYAYMDo not let anger upset your spirit, for anger lodges in the bosom of a fool. Ecclesiastes 7:9If every Senator is willing to support it by unanimous consent, the Senate could pass a bill, before the end of the week, that would allow families charged with illegal entry to be kept together while awaiting an expedited hearing. I truly hope that is what we do.Led by @JohnCornyn a group of us are finalizing bill that will allow families to be held together pending expedited hearing. We can &amp; must avoid BOTH creating incentive to unlawfully enter with children AND separating children from their parents https://t.co/Cxrieul3tkReleasing those who unlawfully enter b/c they came with children creates a cruel incentive to bring children on dangerous journey. Detaining parents is cruel because it separates families. Lets change the law so we can hold families together while awaiting expedited hearingsListen to counsel and receive instruction,
that you may eventually become wise.  Proverbs 19:20Tonight I issued a joint bi-partisan statement with @SenTomCotton, @SenSchumer, @ChrisVanHollen after the Senate today passed our #ZTE amendment.

Intl supervised presidential elections in early 19Alarming increase in #Suicide is a reminder that we have serious problems in our country that are much deeper than our economy &amp; can’t be measured by unemployment rate or GDP growth. The erosion of the family &amp; of community is leaving people isolated https://t.co/qEC76fXEMiWhy are we still giving so much money to the ⁦@UN⁩ ? The General Assembly vote was not just anti #Israel bias,it is anti-semitism disguised as international diplomacy. Totally grotesque that no mention of the evil acts committed by #Hamas
 https://t.co/vFhA1wpag8Timeline important. #China wants #NorthKorea talks to be step by step process of simultaneous actions which are synchronized &amp; phased. Why? They want to force us into significant troop reduction in #SouthKorea &amp; removal of THAAD missile defense system. https://t.co/cu98q8aJfUThe naive believe everything,but the shrewd watch their steps. Proverbs 14:15BTW @Apple who is very proud of how they are making it harder for American law enforcement to collect evidence from iPhones of criminals, had not problem turning over their ENTIRE CLOUD in #China to the Chinese government. Not just the phones ALL THE DATA https://t.co/jditvdGxFZThe next time someone asks “what’s the difference between what China telecomms do &amp; what ours do?” show them this article. You think #Huawei or #ZTE can deny #China police ability to collect anything from their phones?  https://t.co/jditvdGxFZ3 months ago blocked foreign purchase of ZTE’s top U.S. supplier b/c it would endanger natl security &amp; cede U.S. primacy in semiconductor &amp; wireless industry. But now we are saving #ZTE by allowing them to continue to buy same critical technology?  https://t.co/lPHe9uv1qEThe current deal with #ZTE does indeed make them pay a big price for violations of #NorthKorea &amp; #Iran sanctions. But our governments oversight over business side of ZTE will not be able to protect the U.S. from the technical threat they pose to the U.S.  https://t.co/NNEIWE2mgbImportant to remember #ZTE is about 2 seperate issues. 
1: Sanctions violations. The penalties imposed for that are ok. 
2: Risk they pose to our national security. This is the focus of our proposal. We should do NOTHING that keeps a national security threat in business ANYWHERE.Watch @FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom at 10AM will discuss how role of @potus &amp; congress on #NorthKorea are different. He’s the negotiator who needs to try &amp; strike a good deal. We have to define what is good &amp; approve it as treaty instead of it being unconstitutional like #IranDeal https://t.co/IpDwotu5Mk#EVerify is a very important reform.  And while it is true that we struggle to find U.S. workers for many agriculture jobs, that is NOT true of construction. Americans can &amp; want to do construction work. https://t.co/u80MJ71prrYes the video @potus produced &amp; played for #KJU is unusual. But he was meeting with a different kind of guy. The video should be the least of our concerns. It won’t hurt &amp; showing the guy a little shine might actually work.  https://t.co/vbKNykEfS0 #axiosamDrug lord @dcabellor knows full well he has lost many of the things he bought under other names with stolen money. One day they will be sold &amp; hundreds of millions returned to legitimate government in #Venezuela to help repair damage regime has caused.  https://t.co/aSeqwMUZ6HNow is a good time to start getting rid of your #Huawei investments. Because while #ZTE poses a very serious threat to the U.S. Huawei is 100 times worse. #Next  https://t.co/2s712QsTK9I bless the LORD who counsels me;even at night my heart exhorts me. I keep the LORD always before me; with him at my right hand, I shall never be shaken. Psalms 16: 7-8One more thing about KJU. While I know @potus is trying to butter him up to get a good deal, #KJU is NOT a talented guy. He inherited the family business from his dad &amp; grandfather. He is a total weirdo who would not be elected assistant dog catcher in any democracy..@NickKristof I’m uncomfortable with suspending military exercises &amp; if this becomes permanent in exchange for nothing you are 100% correct. However after Trump bent over backwards to be conciliatory, if #KJU does nothing, intl sanctions will be easier to enforce &amp; increase https://t.co/rMplXVkANYAny “deal” that doesn’t ultimately bring to an end these atrocities under #KimJongun is not a good deal.  https://t.co/jDL3vHDvaDShould be skeptical of any deal with #KJU Limits to future strategic weapons instead of eliminating current program not an acceptable outcome. Hope I’m wrong but still believe they will never give up nukes &amp; ICBM’s unless believe failure to do so triggers regime ending reactionPresidents meeting with #KJU exposed incredible hypocrisy of many in media. When Obama did these things,he was described as enlightened. When Trump does it he is reckless &amp; foolish. 1 yr ago they attacked Trump for leading us towards war,now attack for being too quick for peaceI too have concerns about how all this with #NorthKorea will turn out. But I don’t recall all the “experts” criticizing Obama when he met with a brutal dictator in #Cuba who also oversaw a police state &amp; also killed &amp; jailed his opponents. #DoubleStandard  https://t.co/j5x6wPiMGbIt is true @Potus did what previous administration didn’t do,punish #ZTE for sanctions violations. But this is about much more than sanctions violation. It is about the threat ZTE &amp; #Huawei pose to U.S. telecomm infrastructure.  https://t.co/A7Ii35gHvHHow long, O people, will you be hard of heart? Why do you love what is worthless, chase after lies? Psalms 4:3Great news! Our bipartisan amendment restoring penalties on #ZTE is included in the #NDAA bill the Senate will be advancing to later this evening.The message from latest @ChickfilA incident is this: “Your church can still teach traditional marriage (which by the way we will still label as a bigoted belief) but don’t you dare repeat it outside of church or we will come after you, your business and/or your job.”.@ChickfilA isn’t denying service to anyone. But if you eat there you must be attacked by the twitter mob b/c owner agrees with what his church teaches about marriage? Why would twitter mob stop at biz owned by Christians? Who is next? Christian schools? Christian charities?This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy. https://t.co/EnChlPBStc via @cbsmoneywatchI STRONGLY support trans-Atlantic alliance &amp; wish ⁦@POTUS⁩ would have dealt with #China before turning to trade with allies. That said, some seem to forget that his first obligation is to the American people not to the alliance.  https://t.co/dY7QZpK4BnOur #TaiwanTravelAct signed by @potus pushes for more high level visits. Opening of the compound in #Taiwan is perfect chance to start doing it. #China bullying &amp; breaking promises on Hong Kong justifies Taiwan lack of enthusiasm for “reunification”  https://t.co/173r5D5QMsBlessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart,for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers,for they will be called children of God. Matthew 5: 7-9Thorns &amp; thistles it shall bear for you,&amp; you shall eat the grass of the field. By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread, Until you return to the ground, from which you were taken; For you are dust, and to dust you shall return. Genesis 3: 18-19Many valid points here. Our allies do impose unfair tariffs &amp; non-tariff barriers on us. But we should first have worked with them to focus solely on #China &amp; then dealt with these issues after. Read: The Era of American Complacency on Trade Is Over https://t.co/bdDF6orO8IOne point is missed in this analysis. If #China tech companies use protection given by govt to grab  dominance in 5G or A.I. they become global standard &amp; will dominate development in the fields that depend on those technologies like autonomous vehicles. https://t.co/dv0KS11mAlHere’s some advice for all of the recent high school and college graduates out there. https://t.co/E6KWzbbqaJPlease read this story about an amazing family in need of a helping hand &amp; the incredible people who helped them.

For the LORD is my strength and my might,and he has been my salvation. Isaiah 12:2What Kim Jong-un wants from summit is to be viewed as an important world leader that is reasonable,affable &amp; equal to @potus &amp; to be able to give elites in #NorthKorea hope for near term sanctions relief without giving more than vague commitments on nukes https://t.co/cvWrGiOpRTAs I said 2 days ago,U.S. not going to stand by &amp; allow human rights abusers &amp; those undermining democracy in #Nicaragua to spend their weekends vacationing in Miami. Today @StateDept @SecPompeo issued visa restrictions against some of them. More to come. https://t.co/5I8XPVUQj0If the apps you download to your phone, like Facebook, can access your private information, imagine what a company like #ZTE which makes THE ACTUAL PHONE ITSELF can access!  https://t.co/hE6Aczha7ZAfter todays decision to give #ZTE a pass, we have introduced a bipartisan amendment to restore penalties on ZTE, &amp; to prohibit the U.S. govt from purchasing any equipment or services from #Huawei or ZTE or using any grants or loans to subsidize them. https://t.co/seySQI6BDcU.S. has had to evacuate some employees from #China after complaints of mystery illness. And we should have every reason to believe this is just the tip of the iceberg in both China &amp; #Cuba  https://t.co/dkf1B80B4eNext time ⁦@CommerceGov⁩ says problem with #ZTE was only about sanctions violations &amp; that all they make are phones remember this article. If you can be spied on due to malware you load on a phone, imagine if the spy actually made the phone itself! https://t.co/LqTorjFRzaWhy is #ZTE and #Huawei a big threat? #China already on verge of becoming global leader in 5G. Will have full scale deployment by 2020 &amp; have approval for stations in Europe. This will allow them to dominate autonomous vehicles &amp; Internet of Things. All using tech stolen from usI’m rooting for the Knights. How about you? https://t.co/5xKA2aEDbnI assure you with 100% confidence that #ZTE is a much greater national security threat than steel from Argentina or Europe. #VeryBadDealThis “deal” with #ZTE may keep them from selling to Iran and North Korea. That’s good. But it will do nothing to keep us safe from corporate &amp; national security espionage. That is dangerous. Now Congress will need to act to keep America safe from #ChinaHear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD alone!
Therefore, you shall love the LORD, your God, with your whole heart, and with your whole being, and with your whole strength. Take to heart these words which I command you today.

Summit failure blamed on lack of “message discipline” by Trump officials &amp; not on the paranoid dictator who inherited, not earned, his power, &amp; who stays in power through deception &amp; murder https://t.co/mXHlwuiAppKim Jong un stays in power through force &amp; deception &amp; believes nukes give him prestige &amp; reduce chances of U.S. attack. He never wanted a nuke deal,he wanted as much sanctions relief as possible without giving them up. Unfortunately the options on dealing with him are narrowingYes they have a deal in mind. It is a great deal... for #ZTE &amp; China. #China crushes U.S. companies with no mercy &amp; they use these telecomm companies to spy &amp; steal from us. Many hoped this time would be different. Now congress will need to act.  https://t.co/ETMUCe9ia6Drip drip drip...#China gets another country to drop diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. #Taiwan is a democracy &amp; loyal U.S. ally. We MUST do more to help them. Right now I see no strategy to help them at all. Very sad &amp; bad message about our loyalty.  https://t.co/mhhbXC8eToTrue. But #MajorKey its not every day a quote from Miami’s own fits so perfectly. #AnotherOne https://t.co/n8Ma7ZJoesKim Jun Un, in the words of a wise man “Congratulations, you just played yourself”. Withdrawing from talks with #NKorea is 100% the right decision. #KJU doesn’t want a deal. He has deliberately sabotaged the talks over the last two weeks &amp; was setting us up to take the blame.#NKorea “shutting down” test site is a show to make #KJU appear cooperative &amp; responsible.  Bottom line is they either give up nukes &amp; missiles or they don’t. I suspect they don’t want a deal,but want U.S. blamed for it so international sanctions collapse  https://t.co/swc5F8YsKvTime will tell whether they can report on China without interference. We should watch this closely. I hope they can pull it off and be able to report honestly and openly. Had ok article yesterday. We shall see. But if not, they should be registered as foreign agent.Maybe this partnership between @politico &amp; Chinese owned newspaper should be required to register as foreign agent. All media in #China operates with the permission of Communist Party. Can this partnership really report without interference from China?  https://t.co/R1uTXmPT0jNot credible to claim that @CommerceGov needs to change punishment on #ZTE because they didn’t intend to put them out of business.

https://t.co/ezARlkJsvuThis threat is very real. Not hard to produce incredibly convincing videos of things that never happened. On the eve of an election a foreign intel agency could release a #DeepFake video of a U.S. political leader taking bribes or other wrongdoing creating incredible chaos https://t.co/VsI6z6ddsISmart to insist on concrete steps before talks. #N.Korea inviting media to witness closing of Nuke site &amp; freeing hostages are all clever tactics to make KJU appear reasonable &amp; trap the U.S. into being perceived as a spoiler if nuke talks fall apart.  https://t.co/1LxCEMOKJTRelationship between U.S. &amp; #China will define 21st century. I have urged @potus to follow his initial instincts on China &amp; listen to those in his administration who understand that a short term trade deal that sounds good but poses long term danger is a #BadDealThose in the administration pushing for deal with #ZTE have access to same classified info we do about the national security danger posed by #ZTE &amp; #China telecomm. I don’t understand how they can push for a deal that lets them keep operating in U.S.  https://t.co/kLM8hSUVFqA $1.3billion fine &amp; forcing them to buy more semi-conductors is how administration plans to punish ZTE? $1.3 billion is nothing for company backed by #China govt.

Paid $1billion fine &amp; agreed to discipline employees. But then lied again &amp; instead of discipline gave those employees bonuses. Now we are offering same deal of fine &amp; employee discipline?Sadly #China is out-negotiating the administration &amp; winning the trade talks right now. They have avoided tariffs &amp; got a #ZTE deal without giving up anything meaningful in return by using N.Korea talks &amp; agriculture issues as leverage. This is #NotWinning https://t.co/5kGO3qRGfYBeing a tool for espionage &amp; theft of U.S. intellectual property is bad enough. But #ZTE was sanctioned because it blatantly broke previous agreement with U.S. &amp; vi­o­lated sanc­tions against #Iran &amp; #NorthKo­rea. But we trust them with a new agreement? https://t.co/LXxihRykqzIf this is true, then administration has surrendered to #China on #ZTE Making changes to their board &amp; a fine won’t stop them from spying &amp; stealing from us. But this is too important to be over.

You are a puff of smoke that appears briefly and then disappears. James 4:13-14Blaming John Bolton for N.Korea threats last week is ridiculous. More than anyone else our friends in S. Korea know full well that Kim Jung Un actions are same tactics they has used in the past to divide opposing side &amp; thereby gain leverage before talks. https://t.co/ccuFAao7zzFacing dissatisfaction within his own governing party Maduro thought sham election would help consolidate his power. Instead it consolidated sanctions &amp; isolation. Now he will concentrate power in a smaller inner circle &amp; many party leaders are about to be marginalized or jailed.Maduro very wrong if he thinks fake election will alleviate sanctions. @POTUS just imposed new sanctions that restrict the regime’s ability to earn kickbacks through sales of state assets &amp; that prohibit buying any debt owed to Govt of #Venezuela,including debts owed to @PDVSASome #Florida elections officials didn’t like it when I said this.
