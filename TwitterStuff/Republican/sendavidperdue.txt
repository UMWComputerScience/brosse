#TeamPerdue recently met with leadership from @EasterSealsSGA, took part in an event providing services to homeless veterans, attended Major Meredith Kirchhoff‚Äôs promotion ceremony at @DobbinsARB, and toured Baker Farms &amp; Southern Valley Farms. https://t.co/JmUxTUPVqAUnfortunately, a provision was eliminated that would level the playing field for American textile mills. It also included a provision that will impose one-size-fits-all standards on farms. I hope these issues will be worked out before the bill reaches @POTUS' desk. #FarmBill18This Farm Bill: 
‚úÖ Saves more $ than the last Farm Bill
‚úÖ Cracks down on food stamp fraud
‚úÖ Protects peanut &amp; cotton farmers
‚úÖ Advances turf grass &amp; timber research
‚úÖ Includes provisions important to land grant universities

It‚Äôs not perfect, but it will provide certainty. https://t.co/jVvDEooVoMI grew up working on my family‚Äôs farm and learned at an early age that agriculture is both a business &amp; a way of life for many in our country. The Farm Bill the Senate passed today is an investment in those people, in the ag industry, &amp; in our country. #FarmBill18Heading to the Senate floor to speak about about the #FarmBill. Watch here around 10:30AM: https://t.co/IettNM8qZQ #gapolJustice Kennedy has served our country honorably for decades, and I join the nation in wishing him all the best as he retires from the Supreme Court. President Trump made a fantastic choice with Justice Gorsuch, and I‚Äôm confident he will make another outstanding nomination.As GA‚Äôs population has grown, we have dramatically lowered our per capita consumption of water &amp; proven that our state is a responsible steward of resources. I'm hopeful the next phase of this dispute will move efficiently &amp; quickly so we can finally put an end to this issue.There‚Äôs no denying that each of these countries present us with a range of destabilizing threats, and it‚Äôs reassuring that we have a President today who‚Äôs proactively strengthening security measures in order to protect our homeland.#SCOTUS made clear today that President Trump is acting well within his authority by increasing our country‚Äôs baseline security requirements for Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, &amp; Venezuela.Locating the @usairforce‚Äôs new Advanced Battle Management System at @RobinsAFB_GA means Robins will continue to play a critical role in fulfilling our national defense strategy &amp; ensure Robins is a force for decades to come.

For years, he has seen how America has often been treated unfairly when it comes to trade.President Trump‚Äôs approach is working, and I‚Äôm tired of senators trying to undercut him at every turn. https://t.co/d9GddCnzfiThis is a big win for Georgia. #SHEP has the best return on investment of any @USACEHQ project in the country at 7.3 to 1 and will help the U.S. compete globally. @gaports #gapol https://t.co/EY737gFNsDWow.

Hope you‚Äôll tune in. #MakeCongressWorkAgain #gapolIt is important to remember that simply canceling the August state work period is not the goal. We should be working nights &amp; weekends now to get the results the American people sent us here to deliver. #MakeCongressWorkAgainWe still have 271 nominations to confirm, and we must complete the appropriations process before September 30. @POTUS was clear when he said he will not sign another last-minute omnibus spending bill again. We should not go home until we have completed our work.Senate Republicans have accomplished a great deal this year, but more needs to be done. That‚Äôs why it is encouraging that Leader McConnell took our concerns into consideration.Congress should work nights, weekends, &amp; through the August recess if necessary to break through gridlock, confirm @POTUS‚Äô team, &amp; fund the gov‚Äôt on time. #MakeCongressWorkAgainCongress has 54 working days until the fiscal year ends. If Washington doesn‚Äôt act now, the cycle of last-minute funding bills to keep the lights on will continue, while a few politicians get in a room &amp; decide how to spend a trillion dollars.Under @POTUS‚Äô leadership: 
‚úÖ Nearly 3M new jobs created
‚úÖ 870 rules &amp; regs eliminated
‚úÖ 1,500 bureaucrats fired @ VA for poor performance
‚úÖ Consumer confidence = 17-year high
‚úÖ CEO confidence = 20-year high 
‚úÖ Gorsuch confirmed to Supreme Court

...and just getting started!Today marks @POTUS Trump‚Äôs 500th day in office. He is putting the American people first and moving at a business pace, not a bureaucratic pace. His first 500 days = promises made &amp; promises kept.Congratulations to Randy Evans, an outstanding Georgian, on being sworn in as our new U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg! https://t.co/IJsrmbseoJ#TeamPerdue was proud to co-host a veterans expo in Kennesaw on Friday.

Most of our discretionary spending ‚Äì including funding for defense, veterans, &amp; domestic programs ‚Äì is borrowed.Our veterans &amp; their families deserve the benefits they were promised.

‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/5gpiduR8hM https://t.co/QKPKXIfNAL.@POTUS said he would never sign another massive, last-minute funding bill again. Congress has not gotten the message. We need to take action now to overcome obstruction &amp; fund the gov‚Äôt on time.

We are willing to work 24/7, through the weekends, and through August recess if necessary to get results. #MakeCongressWorkAgainIn March, @POTUS said he was never going to sign another massive, last-minute spending bill like the omnibus again. Last week, he called on the US Senate to get its work done before August, or stay here until the job is done. He‚Äôs exactly right. #MakeCongressWorkAgainThere are now just 64 working days between now and the end of the fiscal year on September 30th. Less than 12 weeks to get 12 funding bills done to fund the government.

Watch his message here: https://t.co/c176ZqTGAU #gapolIn March, @POTUS said he was never going to sign another massive, last-minute spending bill like the omnibus again. He‚Äôs serious about this, and he shouldn‚Äôt have to sign another bad funding deal.

The American people deserve no less. #MakeCongressWorkAgain.@POTUS has a powerful agenda to grow our economy, rebuild our military, and repair our infrastructure. Congress has a critical role to play in this.We are sending another letter to Congressional leadership to let them know we are willing to work 24/7, through the weekends, and through the August recess if necessary to get our priorities accomplished. #MakeCongressWorkAgain https://t.co/BCbA7RtyP8Last August, many of us came together &amp; called for canceling the Senate‚Äôs August recess. Today, we are continuing that push.@POTUS This is unacceptable. We are here today because we refuse to let this happen. We want to get results &amp; responsibly fund the federal gov‚Äôt. #MakeCongressWorkAgainOn top of that, Senate Democrats are continuing historic obstruction when it comes to confirming @POTUS‚Äô nominees. At the current rate, it is unlikely @POTUS will have all of his nominees confirmed before the end of his term. #MakeCongressWorkAgainBoth the House &amp; Senate have only 12 weeks to get 12 appropriations bills done to fund the gov‚Äôt by the end of the fiscal year.

It is imperative the newly formed Joint Select Committee change the budget process to address the structural problems that lead to this unacceptable outcome.This spending bill is not a product that represents everybody. It‚Äôs a product written by a few politicians who got in a room and decided how to spend a trillion dollars. The result is a massive spending package projected to increase the federal debt by another trillion dollars.I oppose this massive spending bill. Washington has reached a new low. We are 6 months into this fiscal year and just now voting on funding for the remainder of it. Not to mention, this is after TWO shutdowns and FIVE continuing resolutions.

The Grassley proposal is BACKED by DHS, not torn apart by DHS like the Schumer plan.Unbelievable.

He‚Äôs going to bring the same track record of success to rebuilding our country‚Äôs infrastructure.2) @POTUS campaigned &amp; won on fixing our immigration system, &amp; he is showing real leadership to get it done.@POTUS 1) The agenda is working. As a result of historic tax cuts &amp; regulatory relief, companies are creating new jobs, pumping money into the economy, &amp; investing in America. PLUS, 3M+ Americans are receiving a bonus or wage increase. This is the beginning of a real turnaround..@POTUS just delivered a message of optimism that all Americans needed to hear.

As a father and grandfather, I cannot imagine anyone not wanting to protect the life of an unborn child.@realDonaldTrump Also, if Democrats are serious about solving the DACA situation, how can they be against the reasonable solution @POTUS laid out?.@realDonaldTrump issued a brilliant framework for an immigration middle ground. When will conservatives ever have this kind of opportunity to solve the causes of the immigration problems we have now, including ending chain migration?Calling into @larry_kudlow‚Äôs show at 11AM to discuss the latest on immigration &amp; all the positive results we‚Äôre seeing since making changes to the tax code. LISTEN HERE: https://t.co/sHaGsqAI5FGreat opportunity for @GeorgiaTech students to put the skills they learn in the classroom into practice! https://t.co/wTpsCpGkTJThe White House framework is something that both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate should be eager to support. We all want a good deal, and here it is. #gapolAwesome news from Atlanta-based @HomeDepot: Hourly employees will receive up to a $1,000 bonus because of changes made to the tax code.

Welcome to Georgia! üëç https://t.co/MlFM0c2C6kNEW POLL: Americans overwhelmingly support @realDonaldTrump's efforts to fix our legal immigration system.

Listen in: https://t.co/uJzwCNwsfFOne thing was proven during the #SchumerShutdown: Democrats are out of touch with the American people. https://t.co/qGMFroIluGJoining @foxandfriends at 7:15AM to discuss immigration. Hope you‚Äôll tune in! #gapolGoing on live with @GetAustinRhodes at 5:40PM. Tune in to 580AM/95.1FM in Augusta or listen here: https://t.co/iJRcBIEEHwIt‚Äôs ridiculous that the #SchumerShutdown ever happened in the first place. I‚Äôm glad Senate Democrats came to their senses and ended their political stunt. My full statement: https://t.co/OgNHUQNnGxMy statement on the ridiculous #SchumerShutdown: https://t.co/LMe9h0ggtXIt is inspiring to see so many Georgians in our nation‚Äôs capital today marching to protect unborn life and make a powerful statement to our country's leaders and the world: all life is worth protecting. #MarchForLifeAny DACA solution must, among other things, include an end to chain migration, which is one of the biggest problems in our immigration system today. Read more in my op-ed w/ @ChuckGrassley &amp; @SenTomCotton: https://t.co/6icGjofeCpIf we don't actually solve what created this DACA situation, we're going to be right back here in a few years and that's the problem I have with this so-called Graham-Durbin proposal.DACA and funding the federal government are two seperate issues. They have nothing to do with each other and should not be tied together. I'm shocked Democrats are advocating for shutting down the government over this. It is no way to govern.It is absolutely ridiculous that we're in the fourth month of this fiscal year-- in the middle of January-- and we still haven‚Äôt funded the government for the balance of the year. No other entity that I know of can do this except the United States federal government.I've said it before and I'll say it again on the Senate floor in few minutes: The President has been consistent ‚Äì Any solution on DACA must include border security and a WALL, END chain migration, and ELIMINATE the visa lottery. 

Watch live here: https://t.co/IettNM8qZQEnjoyed spending a few moments snapping #selfies and talking with metro Atlanta students and teachers visiting our nation‚Äôs capital yesterday. Hope you have a great trip! https://t.co/EUJv6TEbfvThis is huge. Because of our new tax system, Apple is:
