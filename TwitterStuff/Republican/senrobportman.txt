Watch here: https://t.co/bnThHJWVsdI was honored to receive the Audubon Society’s Conservation Hero Award for my work to protect migratory birds &amp; their habitats. #LakeErie serves as an important habitat &amp; I will continue to fight for GLRI funding to protect it. https://t.co/mfkLowuWMXAt the Joint Select Cmte pension hearing today, I voiced my concern that without proactive reforms we will face a crisis that could bankrupt many #smallbiz within the Central States Pension Fund https://t.co/sHJnNG2JaMEarlier today I spoke on @CNN and @FOXNews about the North Korean Summit, the evil nature of this regime &amp; my skepticism about these negotiations. I’m hopeful but we must hold #NorthKorea accountable for its promises on denuclearization https://t.co/Z8gu0RcL1yGreat to meet w/ @AQHA, District Court Judge Jack Zouhary, @citizensclimate and many more #Ohioans at today’s Buckeye Coffee. We had good conversations about my bipartisan #STOPAct as well as well as the #FarmBill18 https://t.co/oWeNswhjroThe @OHdeptofHealth estimates that about 84 infants are being treated for drug withdrawal in #Ohio hospitals every day. My bipartisan #CRIBAct passed @GOPSenFinance yesterday &amp; will allow babies to receive the quality care they deserve in the best setting https://t.co/HDQ4ZenpedOne of the most heartwrenching effects of the #opioidcrisis is newborns suffering from opioid withdrawal. Im pleased that @GOPSenFinance passed my bipartisan #CRIBAct yesterday which will help ensure that these babies are given the care they need to thrive https://t.co/HDQ4Ze5NPDAt @EnergyGOP hearing today I pressed @FERC on the importance of complying with the federal law I wrote to streamline the federal infrastructure permitting process https://t.co/yFN1ibqkcm #jobsMy staff held a breakout session at the #2018opiateconference hosted by @OACBHA to discuss how my #CARA2 bill will build on the progress to fight the opioid crisis from my #CARA bill. https://t.co/qdEYbZkdMfThe only reason #Iran was not able to convert their assets using our financial system was because the 2 U.S. banks stood up to the Obama administration and refused to complete the transaction after they were asked to do so. https://t.co/ORloOQjXjLLast week the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations that I chair unveiled a report showing the Obama admin. misled the American people by granting a special license to #Iran to convert billions of $$ using the US financial system, after multiple assurances that would never happen.More good news because of #taxreform via @CNBC: #Smallbiz optimism at its highest level in 30+ years. More #jobs &amp; higher wages are boosting our economy, helping families https://t.co/eIq6FXhtFHFollowing this summit I remain skeptical but hopeful that this new dialogue can translate into meaningful progress. #POTUS’ maximum pressure campaign must remain in place until #NorthKorea truly changes course &amp; ends its dangerous nuclear weapons program.For nearly 18 months I worked to help secure the release of Otto Warmbier. Nearly one year ago, I joined Fred and Cindy Warmbier in #Cincinnati as they welcomed Otto home from #NorthKorea, and it’s a constant reminder to me about the evil nature of this regime.I am hopeful that the negotiations can achieve these goals. In the past, however, #NorthKorea has used talks to stall while continuing its nuclear and missile programs.  Empty promises cannot buy any more time.I have long called for a direct dialogue between the U.S. &amp; #NorthKorea, and I have supported this summit with the goal of achieving a peaceful solution that includes North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.I’m urging the administration, along with a bipartisan group of 10 Senators, to release an @HHSGov study regarding what levels of certain chemicals are safe in drinking water. The @EPA is blocking the release of the results &amp; Americans deserve to know https://t.co/qHDTUyov6VGood news: @USDOT announced they will award the #Ohio Rail Development Commission more than $16 million in funding which will go towards critical improvements &amp; I believe this will help our economy &amp; usher in a new wave of economic development https://t.co/uo4JJWoCueI’ve helped lead the fight for more funding to combat the #opioidcrisis &amp; support our first responders. My #CARA2 bill will build upon my #CARA legislation &amp; provide additional resources as well as more prevention, treatment, &amp; recovery services to help turn the tide of addiction https://t.co/MetRl0mJw0It was my honor to present the first ever CARES Awards at Ohio’s Annual Opiate Conference Luncheon. These 4 outstanding first responders were recognized for their service and for going above &amp; beyond in helping their community deal w/ the adverse effects of #Ohio’s #opioidcrisis. https://t.co/NxpNAMwOdAJane &amp; I had a wonderful time biking 23 miles for the 12th annual #RideCincinnati supporting the Barrett Cancer Center this past Sunday. Everyone has been impacted by this terrible disease and Jane and I were proud to be a part of such an incredible event https://t.co/O2cvUrg2PwThanks to #taxreform businesses creating more #jobs &amp; raising wages. However finding workers to fill those #jobs is proving difficult b/c of the #opioidcrisis. My op-ed for @washingtonpost urges businesses to take initiative in combating this epidemic https://t.co/yngCeXiASJThe only reason Iran was not granted access to the US financial system is b/c two U.S. banks refused the #Obama admin’s request to complete the transaction. My report outlines recommendations designed to prevent this from happening in the future. https://t.co/FAfqlBYviAThe #Obama admin made clear that it would not grant #Iran access to the US financial system either before or after the deal was struck. This week the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair released a detailed report which shows that is not true https://t.co/Ni18NxBsEpOn Friday I had a terrific conversation with @ClevelandVMAC about their efforts to reduce opioid prescriptions by nearly 25% since 2010. MY #CARA2 legislation would reduce the limit of opioid prescriptions to 3 days for acute pain to combat addiction. https://t.co/iI0ZGJfFfsRecently I spoke on the @SenateFloor about my #STOPAct which aims to help stop the shipment of illegal synthetic drugs into our communities from foreign countries like #China. The #opioidcrisis is at epidemic proportions and must be combated. https://t.co/sHbXLpdKabProud to ride with so many dedicated supporters in the fight against cancer. @RideCincinnati is a wonderful organization raising money for cancer research.

We need to make this program permanent &amp; I introduced bipartisan legislation this week that will do just that. https://t.co/mXMdoyfuhNI testified before the International Trade Commission earlier this week &amp; urged them to protect #Ohio steelworkers, like those who produce tapered roller bearings from unfair dumping or selling from foreign countries like South Korea. My testimony in full https://t.co/LL7GgkuX75This week @POTUS signed the VA MISSION Act into law.

(2/2)Profoundly saddened to learn of the tragic passing of Rabbi Dr. Aaron Panken, the 12th President of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. (1/2)Recently I wrote a letter, alongside the entire Ohio Congressional Delegation, urging the Pentagon to locate the F-35 HPSI organization at @WrightPattAFB. Wright-Patt is uniquely qualified to handle this new mission &amp; it could create 400+ #jobs in #Ohio https://t.co/jKl7gFy13eI spoke on the @SenateFloor recently about the importance of combating the #opioidcrisis My #CARA2 will limit RX to 3 days to battle addiction to opioids while my #STOPAct will help prevent the shipment of synthetic drugs into the US via our mail system https://t.co/8l4cnilHJXEarlier this month I introduced the bipartisan Creating Quality Technical Educators Act which will help to train and provide high-quality CTE teachers to schools in order to better prepare students for future careers. https://t.co/r1BrR4kdcRThis week in #Marietta #Ohio I participated in a roundtable with local advocates, community leaders, and law enforcement to discuss joint efforts on the local and federal level to combat the #opioidcrisis. The only way to defeat this epidemic is by working together. https://t.co/mO0unXHDKfI penned an op-ed for @IrontonTribune about how the new #taxreform law is truly benefitting families in #Ohio. An #Ohio family of 4 at the median income level will save about $2000 this year on their taxes thanks to the new law. https://t.co/fFSz1haf37Ready to watch @KingJames and the @cavs take on the Raptors at home after a successful trip to our neighbor to the north! #WhateverItTakesToday is the last day of #SmallBusinessWeek. I have crisscrossed #Ohio for my Results for the Middle Class Tax Reform Tour and have met with numerous #smallbiz that are using their #TaxReform savings to create #jobs, increase pay &amp; expand benefits to workers &amp; families in #OhioI had the opportunity this week to tour Flying HIGH Welding School. This school, based in #Youngstown #Ohio is dedicated to helping those in recovery or recently released from prison have the skills they need to succeed and achieve their God-given potential. https://t.co/7FuT5DPYByRecently I wrote a joint op-ed w/ @CommDavidHudson discussing the importance of combating the #opioidepidemic on an united front. I am working at the Federal level to help end this crisis but the real change will come at the local level in our communities. https://t.co/brcjtulHPlEarlier this week I had the opportunity to sit down with the Child Protection Center of Ross County for a roundtable to discuss joint efforts in combating sex trafficking. My #SESTA legislation is already working to shut down sites known for trafficking women and children. https://t.co/6YobKDDfZHThe GLRI is helping address the most serious factors effecting the Great Lakes including invasive species, pollution, and toxic contamination. We must protect our Great Lakes at all costs and I will continue to lead this fight in the Senate https://t.co/CmrvfdqeAb (2/2)As co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force I have urged the Appropriations Interior subcommittee to fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.
