I might just go and get my wig chopped
Maybe pill pop
Tell 'em find me up on Wilcox
Until my bills stop
I've been stressing cause my ends low
Them funds be real dry
Did a line up in the Benz yo
And left it feeling right
Man these trips they got me nervous
Like is it worth it?
Shook some hands and join the circus
And got to working
Now my baby she be irking
Like I ain't perfect
I'm just tryna buy the Benzo
And get back to swerving
I'm steady verbin'
Shoot Bang Pow
Gutta gutta with the money
Bitch I'm younga than ya brotha
But I'm closing in on mommy
Shit ain't sunny
When ya closest friend a dog who steady hungry
And ya pocket look like Pluto
Far away from being sunny
Shit up on my resume
Sir why you arresting me?
Can't afford this bail
Damn this tail light be testing me
Pen a pad and destiny
Add a tab of ecstasy
I ain't get a call
All a sudden you be chillin'
They don't feel you 'til you get it huh?
(Keep comin' wit yo mind slow)
No they don't feel you 'til you get it huh
(Keep comin' wit yo mind slow)
Six feet down with the dope on the regular
Bitches come around swear these hoes got me secular
There they go, there they go, there they go

I might just go and get some wing stop
Make 'em things hot
Tell 'em find me up on Wilcox
Until my deal drop
Got my neighbor screaming turn down
Or I'ma tell cop
Pack my bags and clean the pad out
And call the bell hop
Lord I'm back up on my bullshit
Like I'm Rondo
Got no money but the whole clique
Been going Gonzo
In and Out with Friends I'm cool with
I got to lie for
They say they got you 'til the end
There must've been a typo
They really trife so
She don't really wanna talk, cool
I don't really get up just to call you
Funny how a thing or fling will fall through
Then you get a ring in a moment they saw you
I ain't got time for stop and chat dude
Zu boutta wop and cop a track suit
Wu made the law and claimed that cash rule
So I prayed to God and played it back to Him
Two my homies rest in peace
Homie why you testing me
Can't afford to fail
Keep yo head up what he said to me
Paccin' til the end of me
Talkin' like they copped a plea
Funny how they fall
Get a call like how you livin'
They don't feel you 'til you get it huh?
No they don't feel you 'til you get it huh
Six feet down with the dope on the regular
Bitches come around swear these hoes got me secular
There they go, there they go, there they go
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no
No, girl they don't forget it
Love is their home
Happiness yeah
Sq-sq-sq-squeeze her (Sounds so soulful don't you agree)
Don't tease her
Never leave her
I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab, proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublot's
Or the big face Rollie I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back
See my cut through the holes
Damn Yeezy and Hov,
Where the hell ya been?
Niggas talkin' real reckless, stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond 'em
Now I'm bout to make them tuck they whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, well, I'm 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't see me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh, live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G four fifty I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale, I got five passports
I'm never going to jail
I made "Jesus Walks" I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow, it's never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't 'customed to going through customs,
You ain't been nowhere, huh?
And all the ladies in the house, got 'em showing off
I'm done, I hit ya up mana-na!
Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubanos with Castro in cabanas
Viva Mexico, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes, with' no benefits
Not bad huh? For some immigrants
Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
Can't you see? We gettin' money up under you
Can't you see the private jets flyin' over you?
Maybach bumper sticker read "What would Hova do?"
Jay is chillin', 'Ye is chillin'
What more can I say? We killin' 'em
Hold up, before we end this campaign
As you can see, we done bodied the damn lames
Lord, please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne
